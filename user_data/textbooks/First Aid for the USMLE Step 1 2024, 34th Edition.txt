Preface
With the 34th edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 we continue our commitment to providing students with
the most useful and up-to-date preparation guide for this exam. This edition represents an outstanding revision in
many ways, including:
 22 entirely new or heavily revised high-yield topics reflecting evolving trends in the USMLE Step 1.
 Extensive text revisions, new mnemonics, clarifications, and corrections curated by a team of 16 medical student
and resident physician authors who excelled on their Step 1 examinations, and verified by a team of expert
faculty advisors and nationally recognized USMLE instructors.
 Updated with 81 new and revised diagrams and illustrations as part of our ongoing collaboration with
USMLE-Rx and ScholarRx (MedIQ Learning, LLC).
 Updated with 21 new and revised photos to help visualize various disorders, descriptive findings, and basic
science concepts. Additionally, revised imaging photos have been labeled and optimized to show both normal
anatomy and pathologic findings.
 Updated exam preparation advice, tailored for the current pass/fail scoring system and Step 1 blueprint changes.
 New advice on how to utilize emerging AI tools to increase studying efficiency.
 Updated photos of patients and pathologies to include a variety of skin colors to better depict real-world
presentations.
 Improved organization and integration of text, illustrations, clinical images, and tables throughout for focused
review of high-yield topics.
 Revised ratings of current, high-yield review resources, with clear explanations of their relevance to USMLE
review. Replaced outdated resources with new ones recommended by Step takers.
 Real-time Step 1 updates and corrections can be found exclusively on our blog, www.firstaidteam.com.
We invite students and faculty to share their thoughts and ideas to help us continually improve First Aid for the
USMLE Step 1 through our blog and collaborative editorial platform. (See How to Contribute, p. xv.)

minimizing new errata during the revision of the current edition. This reflects our long-standing vision of a true,
student-to-student publication. We have done our best to thank each person individually below, but we recognize
that errors and omissions are likely. Therefore, we will post an updated list of acknowledgments at our website,
www.firstaidteam.com/bonus/. We will gladly make corrections if they are brought to our attention.

How to Contribute
This edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 incorporates thousands of contributions and improvements suggested
by student and faculty advisors. We invite you to participate in this process. Please send us your suggestions for:
 Study and test-taking strategies for the USMLE Step 1
 New facts, mnemonics, diagrams, and clinical images
 High-yield topics that may appear on future Step 1 exams
 Personal ratings and comments on review books, question banks, apps, videos, and courses
 Pathology and radiology images (high resolution) relevant to the facts in the book
For each new entry incorporated into the next edition, you will receive up to a $20 Amazon.com gift card as well as
personal acknowledgment in the next edition. Significant contributions will be compensated at the discretion of the
authors. Also, let us know about material in this edition that you feel is low yield and should be deleted.
All submissions including potential errata should ideally be supported with hyperlinks to a dynamically updated Web
resource such as UpToDate, AccessMedicine, and ClinicalKey.
We welcome potential errata on grammar and style if the change improves readability. Please note that First Aid style
is somewhat unique; for example, we have fully adopted the AMA Manual of Style recommendations on eponyms
(“We recommend that the possessive form be omitted in eponymous terms”) and on abbreviations (no periods with
eg, ie, etc). We also avoid periods in tables unless required for full sentences. Kindly refrain from submitting “style
errata” unless you find specific inconsistencies with the AMA Manual of Style.
The preferred way to submit new entries, clarifications, mnemonics, or potential corrections with a valid,
authoritative reference is via our website: www.firstaidteam.com.
This website will be continuously updated with validated errata, new high-yield content, and a new online platform
to contribute suggestions, mnemonics, diagrams, clinical images, and potential errata.
Alternatively, you can email us at: firstaid@scholarrx.com.
Contributions submitted by May 15, 2024, receive priority consideration for the 2025 edition of First Aid for the
USMLE Step 1. We thank you for taking the time to share your experience and apologize in advance that we cannot
individually respond to all contributors as we receive thousands of contributions each year.

How to Use This Book
CONGRATULATIONS: You now possess the book that has guided nearly two million students to USMLE success
for over 30 years. With appropriate care, the binding should last the useful life of the book. Keep in mind that putting
excessive flattening pressure on any binding will accelerate its failure. If you purchased a book that you believe
is defective, please immediately return it to the place of purchase. If you encounter ongoing issues, you can also
contact Customer Service at our publisher, McGraw Hill.
START EARLY: Use this book as early as possible while learning the basic medical sciences. The first semester of
your first year is not too early! Devise a study plan by reading Section I: Guide to Efficient Exam Preparation, and
make an early decision on resources to use by checking Section IV: Top-Rated Review Resources. Note that First Aid
is neither a textbook nor a comprehensive review book, and it is not a panacea for inadequate preparation.
CONSIDER FIRST AID YOUR ANNOTATION HUB: Annotate this book with material from other resources,
such as class notes or comprehensive textbooks. This will keep all the high-yield information you need in one place.
Other tips on keeping yourself organized:
 For best results, use fine-tipped ballpoint pens (eg, BIC Pro+, Uni-Ball Jetstream Sports, Pilot Drawing Pen,
Zebra F-301). If you like gel pens, try Pentel Slicci, and for markers that dry almost immediately, consider
Staedtler Triplus Fineliner, Pilot Drawing Pen, and Sharpies.
 Consider using pens with different colors of ink to indicate different sources of information (eg, blue for
USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax, green for UWorld Step 1 Qbank, red for Rx Bricks).
 Choose highlighters that are bright and dry quickly to minimize smudging and bleeding through the page
(eg, Tombow Kei Coat, Sharpie Gel).
 Many students de-spine their book and get it 3-hole-punched. This will allow you to insert materials from other
sources, including curricular materials.
INTEGRATE STUDY WITH CASES, FLASH CARDS, AND QUESTIONS: To broaden your learning strategy,
consider integrating your First Aid study with case-based reviews (eg, First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1), flash
cards (eg, USMLE-Rx Step 1 Flash Facts), and practice questions (eg, the USMLE-Rx Step 1 Qmax). Read the
chapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same
topics. Maintain access to more comprehensive resources (eg, ScholarRx Bricks and USMLE-Rx Step 1 Express
videos) for deeper review as needed.
PRIME YOUR MEMORY: Return to your annotated Sections II and III several days before taking the USMLE
Step 1. The book can serve as a useful way of retaining key associations and keeping high-yield facts fresh in your
memory just prior to the exam. The Rapid Review section includes high-yield topics to help guide your studying.
CONTRIBUTE TO FIRST AID: Reviewing the book immediately after your exam can help us improve the next
edition. Decide what was truly high and low yield and send us your comments. Feel free to send us scanned images
from your annotated First Aid book as additional support. Of course, always remember that all examinees are under
agreement with the NBME to not disclose the specific details of copyrighted test material.

` INTRODUCTION
Relax.
This section is intended to make your exam preparation easier, not harder.
Our goal is to reduce your level of anxiety and help you make the most
of your efforts by helping you understand more about the United States
Medical Licensing Examination, Step 1 (USMLE Step 1). As a medical
student, you are no doubt familiar with taking standardized examinations
and quickly absorbing large amounts of material. When you first confront
the USMLE Step 1, however, you may find it all too easy to become
sidetracked from your goal of studying with maximal effectiveness. Common
mistakes that students make when studying for Step 1 include the following:
 Starting to study (including First Aid) too late
 Starting to study intensely too early and burning out
 Starting to prepare for boards before creating a knowledge foundation
 Using inefficient or inappropriate study methods
 Buying the wrong resources or buying too many resources
 Buying only one publisher’s review series for all subjects
 Not using practice examinations to maximum benefit
 Not understanding how scoring is performed or what the result means
 Not using review books along with your classes
 Not analyzing and improving your test-taking strategies
 Getting bogged down by reviewing difficult topics excessively
 Studying material that is rarely tested on the USMLE Step 1
 Failing to master certain high-yield subjects owing to overconfidence
 Using First Aid as your sole study resource
 Trying to prepare for it all alone
In this section, we offer advice to help you avoid these pitfalls and be more
productive in your studies.
` USMLE STEP 1—THE BASICS
The USMLE Step 1 is the first of three examinations that you would

The Step 1 exam includes test items that can be grouped by the organiza-
tional constructs outlined in Table 1 (in order of tested frequency). In late
2020, the USMLE increased the number of items assessing communication
skills. While pharmacology is still tested, they are focusing on drug mecha-
nisms rather than on pharmacotherapy. You will not be required to identify
the specific medications indicated for a specific condition. Instead, you will
be asked more about drug mechanisms and side effects.

How Is the Computer-Based Test (CBT) Structured?
The CBT Step 1 exam consists of one “optional” tutorial/simulation block
and seven “real” question blocks of up to 40 questions per block with no
more than 280 questions in total, timed at 60 minutes per block. A short
11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the
survey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions.
Once an examinee finishes a particular question block on the CBT, he or
she must click on a screen icon to continue to the next block. Examinees
cannot go back and change their answers to questions from any previously
completed block. However, changing answers is allowed within a block of
questions as long as the block has not been ended and if time permits.
What Is the CBT Like?
Given the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become
familiar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You
can access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation.
nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as
the one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it
during the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can
gain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3
blocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle.
org/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center
for a fee.

For security reasons, examinees are not allowed to bring any personal
electronic equipment into the testing area. This includes both digital and
analog watches, cell phones, tablets, and calculators. Examinees are also
prohibited from carrying in their books, notes, pens/pencils, and scratch
paper (laminated note boards and fine-tip dry erase pens will be provided
for use within the testing area). Food and beverages are also prohibited
in the testing area. The testing centers are monitored by audio and video
surveillance equipment. However, most testing centers allot each examinee
a small locker outside the testing area in which he or she can store snacks,
beverages, and personal items.
Questions are typically presented in multiple choice format, with 4 or more

For those who feel they might benefit, the USMLE offers an opportunity
to take a simulated test, or “CBT Practice Session” at a Prometric center.
Students are eligible to register for this three-and-one-half-hour practice
session after they have received their scheduling permit.

presented. The practice session is available at a cost of $75 ($155 if taken
outside of the US and Canada) and is divided into a short tutorial and three
1-hour blocks of ~40 test items each. Students receive a printed percent-
correct score after completing the session. No explanations of questions are
provided.
You may register for a practice session online at www.usmle.org. A separate
scheduling permit is issued for the practice session. Students should allow
two weeks for receipt of this permit.

want to use before making your exam plans.
US students can apply to take Step 1 at the NBME website. This application
allows you to select one of 12 overlapping three-month blocks in which to be
tested (eg, April–May–June, June–July–August). Choose your three-month
eligibility period wisely. If you need to reschedule outside your initial three-
month period, you can request a one-time extension of eligibility for the next
contiguous three-month period, and pay a rescheduling fee. The application
also includes a photo ID form that must be certified by an official at your
medical school to verify your enrollment. After the NBME processes your
application, it will send you a scheduling permit.
The scheduling permit you receive from the NBME will contain your USMLE
identification number, the eligibility period in which you may take the exam,
and two additional numbers. The first of these is known as your “scheduling
number.” You must have this number in order to make your exam appointment
with Prometric. The second number is known as the “candidate identification

to bring your permit into the exam and will be asked to copy your CIN onto
your scratch paper. Prometric has no access to the codes. Make sure to bring
a paper or electronic copy of your permit with you to the exam! Also bring
an unexpired, government-issued photo ID that includes your signature (such
as a d river’s license or passport). Make sure the name on your photo ID exactly
matches the name that appears on your scheduling permit.
Once you receive your scheduling permit, you may access the Prometric
website or call Prometric’s toll-free number to arrange a time to take the

exam. You may contact Prometric two weeks before the test date if you
want to confirm identification requirements. Be aware that your exam
may be canceled because of circumstances related to COVID-19 or other
unforeseen events. If that were to happen, you should receive an email
from Prometric containing notice of the cancellation and instructions on
rescheduling.
Although requests for taking the exam may be completed more than six months
before the test date, examinees will not receive their scheduling permits earlier
than six months before the eligibility period. The eligibility period is the three-
month period you have chosen to take the exam. Most US medical students

December–February or January–March period.
What If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?
You can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at
1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to
have your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must
speak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not
suffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least
31 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled
test date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.
When Should I Register for the Exam?
` Register six months in advance for seating
and scheduling preference. You should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your
desired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test
center, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early
will guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one
within a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students,
the desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship
curriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship
schedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus
US medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of
a June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date. The
timing of the exam is more flexible for IMGs, as it is related only to when
they finish exam preparation. Talk with upperclassmen who have already
taken the test so you have real-life experience from students who went
through a similar curriculum, then formulate your own strategy.
Where Can I Take the Exam?
Your testing location is arranged with Prometric when you book your test
date (after you receive your scheduling permit). For a list of Prometric
locations nearest you, visit www.prometric.com.

How Long Will I Have to Wait Before I Get My Result?
The USMLE reports results in three to four weeks, unless there are delays
in processing. Examinees will be notified via email when their results are
available. By following the online instructions, examinees will be able
to view, download, and print their exam report online for ~120 days after
notification, after which results can only be obtained through requesting an
official USMLE transcript. Additional information about results reporting
timetables and accessibility is available on the official USMLE website.

What About Time?
` Gain extra break time by skipping the
Time is of special interest on the CBT exam. Here’s a breakdown of the tutorial, or utilize the tutorial time to add
exam schedule: personal notes to your scratch paper.
15 minutes Tutorial (skip if familiar with test format and features)
7 hours Seven 60-minute question blocks
45 minutes Break time (includes time for lunch)
The computer will keep track of how much time has elapsed on the exam.
However, the computer will show you only how much time you have
remaining in a given block. Therefore, it is up to you to determine if you
are pacing yourself properly (at a rate of approximately one question per 90
seconds).
The computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted
time for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a
short break when you need one and have time to eat. You must be especially
careful not to spend too much time in between blocks (you should keep track
of how much time elapses from the time you finish a block of questions to the
time you start the next block). After you finish one question block, you’ll need
to click to proceed to the next block of questions. If you do not click within
30 seconds, you will automatically be entered into a break period.
Break time for the day is 45 minutes, but you are not required to use all of
it, nor are you required to use any of it. You can gain extra break time (but
not extra time for the question blocks) by skipping the tutorial or by finishing

you finish a block gets added to your remaining break time. Once a new
question block has been started, you may not take a break until you have
reached the end of that block. If you do so, this will be recorded as an
“unauthorized break” and will be reported on your final exam report.
Finally, be aware that it may take a few minutes of your break time to “check
out” of the secure resting room and then “check in” again to resume testing,
so plan accordingly. The “check-in” process may include fingerprints,
pocket checks, and metal detector scanning. Some students recommend
pocketless clothing on exam day to streamline the process.

If I Freak Out and Leave, What Happens to My Exam?
Your scheduling permit shows a CIN that you will need to enter to start your
exam. Entering the CIN is the same as breaking the seal on a test book, and
you are considered to have started the exam when you do so. However, no
result will be reported if you do not complete the exam. If you leave at any
time after starting the test, or do not open every block of your test, your test
will not be scored and will be reported as incomplete. Incomplete results
count toward the maximum of four attempts for each Step exam. Although
a pass or fail result is not posted for incomplete tests, examinees may still be
offered an option to request that their scores be calculated and reported if
they desire; unanswered questions will be scored as incorrect.
The exam ends when all question blocks have been completed or when
their time has expired. As you leave the testing center, you will receive a
printed test-completion notice to document your completion of the exam.
To receive an official score, you must finish the entire exam.
What Types of Questions Are Asked?
All questions on the exam are one-best-answer multiple choice items.
` Nearly three fourths of Step 1 questions begin
Most questions consist of a clinical scenario or a direct question followed
with a description of a patient.
by a list of four or more options. You are required to select the single best
answer among the options given. There are no “except,” “not,” or matching
questions on the exam. A number of options may be partially correct, in
which case you must select the option that best answers the question or
completes the statement. Additionally, keep in mind that experimental
questions may appear on the exam, which do not affect your exam result.

How Is the Test Scored?
The USMLE transitioned to a pass/fail scoring system for Step 1 on January 26,
2022. Examinees now receive an electronic report that will display the outcome
of either “Pass” or “Fail.” Failing reports include a graphic depiction of the
distance between the examinee’s score and the minimum passing standard
as well as content area feedback. Feedback for the content area shows the
examinee’s performance relative to examinees with a low pass (lower, same, or
higher) and should be used to guide future study plans. Passing exam reports
only displays the outcome of “Pass,” along with a breakdown of topics covered
on that individual examination (which will closely mirror the frequencies listed
in Table 1). Note that a number of questions are experimental and are not
counted toward or against the examinee’s performance.
Examinees who took the test before the transition to pass/fail reporting received
an electronic report that includes the examinee’s pass/fail status, a three-
digit test score, a bar chart comparing the examinee’s performance in each
content area with their overall Step 1 performance, and a graphic depiction
of the examinee’s performance by physician task, discipline, and organ system.
Changes will not be made to transcripts containing three-digit test scores.
The USMLE does not report the minimum number of correct responses
needed to pass, but estimates that it is approximately 60%. The USMLE ` Depending on the resource used, practice

Official NBME/USMLE Resources
The NBME offers a Comprehensive Basic Science Examination (CBSE) for
practice that is a shorter version of the Step 1. The CBSE contains four blocks
of 50 questions each and covers material that is typically learned during the
basic science years. CBSE scores represent the percent of content mastered and
show an estimated probability of passing Step 1. Many schools use this test to
gauge whether a student is expected to pass Step 1. If this test is offered by your
school, it is usually conducted at the end of regular didactic time before any
dedicated Step 1 preparation. If you do not encounter the CBSE before your
dedicated study time, you need not worry about taking it. Use the information
to help set realistic goals and timetables for your success.
The NBME also offers six forms of Comprehensive Basic Science Self-
Assessment (CBSSA). Students who prepared for the exam using this web-
based tool reported that they found the format and content highly indicative
of questions tested on the actual exam. In addition, the CBSSA is a fair
predictor of historical USMLE performance. The test interface, however,
does not match the actual USMLE test interface, so practicing with these
forms alone is not advised.
The CBSSA exists in two formats: standard-paced and self-paced, both of
which consist of four sections of 50 questions each (for a total of 200 multiple
choice items). The standard-paced format allows the user up to 75 minutes
FFAASS11__22002244__0000__SSeeccttiioonn__II..iinndddd 99 11//2299//2244 11::1155 PPMM
10
Section i Guide to efficient exam PreP aration Guide to efficient exam PreP aration
to complete each section, reflecting time limits similar to the actual exam.
By contrast, the self-paced format places a 5-hour time limit on answering all
multiple choice questions. Every few years, new forms are released and older
ones are retired, reflecting changes in exam content. Therefore, the newer
exams tend to be more similar to the actual Step 1, and scores from these
exams tend to provide a better estimation of exam day performance.
Keep in mind that this bank of questions is available only on the web. The
NBME requires that users start and complete the exam within 90 days of
purchase. Once the assessment has begun, users are required to complete
the sections within 20 days. Following completion of the questions, the
CBSSA provides a performance profile indicating the user’s relative
strengths and weaknesses, much like the report profile for the USMLE Step
1 exam. In addition to the performance profile, examinees will be informed
of the number of questions answered incorrectly. You will have the ability
to review the text of all questions with detailed explanations. The NBME
charges $60 for each assessment, payable by credit card or money order. For
more information regarding the CBSE and the CBSSA, visit the NBME’s
website at www.nbme.org.
The NBME scoring system is weighted for each assessment exam. While
some exams seem more difficult than others, the equated percent correct
reported takes into account these inter-test differences. Also, while
many students report seeing Step 1 questions “word-for-word” out of the
assessments, the NBME makes special note that no live USMLE questions
are shown on any NBME assessment.
Lastly, the International Foundations of Medicine (IFOM) offers a Basic
Science Examination (BSE) practice exam at participating Prometric test
centers for $200. Students may also take the self-assessment test online for
$35 through the NBME’s website. The IFOM BSE is intended to determine
an examinee’s relative areas of strength and weakness in general areas of
basic science—not to predict performance on the USMLE Step 1 exam—
and the content covered by the two examinations is somewhat different.
However, because there is substantial overlap in content coverage and many
IFOM items were previously used on the USMLE Step 1, it is possible to
roughly project IFOM performance onto the historical USMLE Step 1
score scale. More information is available at http://www.nbme.org/ifom/.
` LEARNING STRATEGIES
Many students feel overwhelmed during the preclinical years and struggle to
find an effective learning strategy. Table 3 lists several learning strategies you
can try and their estimated effectiveness for Step 1 preparation based on the
literature (see References). These are merely suggestions, and it’s important
to take your learning preferences into account. Your comprehensive
learning approach will contain a combination of strategies (eg, elaborative
interrogation followed by practice testing, mnemonics review using spaced

HIGH EFFICACY
Practice Testing
Also called “retrieval practice,” practice testing has both direct and indirect
benefits to the learner.4 Effortful retrieval of answers does not only identify
weak spots—it directly strengthens long-term retention of material.5 The

questions completed and Step 1 performance among medical students.7
Practice testing should be done with “interleaving” (mixing of questions
from different topics in a single session). Question banks often allow you to
intermingle topics. Interleaved practice helps learners develop their ability to

focus on the relevant concept when faced with many possibilities. Practicing
topics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem
intuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer-
term retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that
involve problem solving.5
In addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your
notes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in
random order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in
mind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information
retrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.
Distributed Practice
Also called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed
practice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out
intervals (days to weeks to months). Massed learning may produce more
short-term gains and satisfaction, but learners who use distributed practice
have better mastery and retention over the long term.5,9
Flash cards are a simple way to incorporate both distributed practice and
practice testing. Studies have linked spaced repetition learning with flash
cards to improved long-term knowledge retention and higher exam scores.6,8,10
` Studies have linked spaced repetition

downloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is
unsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace,
the thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1
preparation. Unless you have specific high-yield cards (and have checked
the content with high-yield resources), stick to pre-made cards by reputable
sources that curate the vast amount of knowledge for you.
If you prefer pen and paper, consider using a planner or spreadsheet to
organize your study material over time. Distributed practice allows for
some forgetting of information, and the added effort of recall over time
strengthens the learning.
MODERATE EFFICACY
Mnemonics
A “mnemonic” refers to any device that assists memory, such as acronyms,
mental imagery (eg, keywords with or without memory palaces), etc. Keyword
mnemonics have been shown to produce superior knowledge retention
when compared with rote memorization in many scenarios. However, they
are generally more effective when applied to memorization-heavy, keyword-
friendly topics and may not be broadly suitable.5 Keyword mnemonics may
not produce long-term retention, so consider combining mnemonics with
distributed, retrieval-based practice (eg, via flash cards with SRS).
FFAASS11__22002244__0000__SSeeccttiioonn__II..iinndddd 1122 11//2299//2244 11::1155 PPMM
13
Guide to efficient exam PreP aration Guide to efficient exam PreP aration Section i
Self-made mnemonics may have an advantage when material is simple and
keyword friendly. If you can create your own mnemonic that accurately
represents the material, this will be more memorable. When topics are
complex and accurate mnemonics are challenging to create, pre-made
mnemonics may be more effective, especially if you are inexperienced at
creating mnemonics.11
Elaborative Interrogation/Self-Explanation
Elaborative interrogation (“why” questions) and self-explanation (general ` Elaborative interrogation and self-
questioning) prompt learners to generate explanations for facts. When explanation prompt learners to generate
reading passages of discrete facts, consider using these techniques, which explanations for facts, which improves recall
have been shown to be more effective than rereading (eg, improved recall and problem solving.
and better problem-solving/diagnostic performance).5,12,13
Concept Mapping
Concept mapping is a method for graphically organizing knowledge, with
concepts enclosed in boxes and lines drawn between related concepts.
Creating or studying concept maps may be more effective than other
activities (eg, writing or reading summaries/outlines). However, studies have
reached mixed conclusions about its utility, and the small size of this effect
raises doubts about its authenticity and pedagogic significance.14
LOW EFFICACY
Rereading
While the most commonly used method among surveyed students,
rereading has not been shown to correlate with grade point average.9 Due to
its popularity, rereading is often a comparator in studies on learning. Other
strategies that we have discussed (eg, practice testing) have been shown to be
significantly more effective than rereading.
Highlighting/Underlining
Because this method is passive, it tends to be of minimal value for learning
and recall. In fact, lower-performing students are more likely to use these
techniques.9 Students who highlight and underline do not learn how
to actively recall learned information and thus find it difficult to apply
knowledge to exam questions.
Summarization
While more useful for improving performance on generative measures (eg,
free recall or essays), summarization is less useful for exams that depend on
recognition (eg, multiple choice). Findings on the overall efficacy of this
method have been mixed.5

` TIMELINE FOR STUDY
Before Starting
Your preparation for the USMLE Step 1 should begin when you enter
medical school. Organize and commit to studying from the beginning so
that when the time comes to prepare for the USMLE, you will be ready with
a strong foundation.
` Customize your schedule. Tackle your weakest Make a Schedule
section first.
After you have defined your goals, map out a study schedule that is consistent
with your objectives, your vacation time, the difficulty of your ongoing
coursework, and your family and social commitments. Determine whether you
want to spread out your study time or concentrate it into 10-hour study days in
the final weeks. Then factor in your own history in preparing for standardized
examinations (eg, SAT, MCAT). Talk to students at your school who have
recently taken Step 1. Ask them for their study schedules, especially those who
have study habits and goals similar to yours. Sample schedules can be found at
https://firstaidteam.com/schedules/.
Typically, US medical schools allot between four and eight weeks for
dedicated Step 1 preparation. The time you dedicate to exam preparation
will depend on your confidence in comfortably achieving a passing score
as well as your success in preparing yourself during the first two years of
medical school. Some students reserve about a week at the end of their
study period for final review; others save just a few days. When you have
scheduled your exam date, do your best to adhere to it.
Make your schedule realistic, and set achievable goals. Many students make
the mistake of studying at a level of detail that requires too much time for a
comprehensive review—reading Gray’s Anatomy in a couple of days is not a
realistic goal! Have one catch-up day per week of studying. No matter how
well you stick to your schedule, unexpected events happen. But don’t let
yourself procrastinate because you have catch-up days; stick to your schedule
as closely as possible and revise it regularly on the basis of your actual
progress. Be careful not to lose focus. Beware of feelings of inadequacy when
comparing study schedules and progress with your peers. Avoid others who
stress you out. Focus on a few top-rated resources that suit your learning
style—not on some obscure resource your friends may pass down to you.
Accept the fact that you cannot learn it all.
You will need time for uninterrupted and focused study. Plan your

an adequate number of breaks in your study schedule to avoid burnout.
Maintain a healthy lifestyle with proper diet, exercise, and sleep.
Another important aspect of your preparation is your studying environment.
Study where you have always been comfortable studying. Be sure to
include everything you need close by (review books, notes, coffee, snacks,

Guide to efficient exam PreP aration Guide to efficient exam PreP aration Section i
etc). If you’re the kind of person who cannot study alone, form a study group
with other students taking the exam. The main point here is to create a
comfortable environment with minimal distractions.
Year(s) Prior
The knowledge you gained during your first two years of medical school and

which to base your test preparation. Student scores on NBME subject tests
(commonly known as “shelf exams”) have been shown to be highly correlated
with subsequent Step 1 performance.15 Moreover, undergraduate science
GPAs as well as MCAT scores are strong predictors of performance on the
Step 1 exam.16
We also recommend that you buy highly rated review books early in your first
year of medical school and use them as you study throughout the two years.
When Step 1 comes along, these books will be familiar and personalized to the
way in which you learn. It is risky and intimidating to use unfamiliar review
books in the final two or three weeks preceding the exam. Some students find
it helpful to personalize and annotate First Aid throughout the curriculum.
Months Prior
Review test dates and the application procedure. Testing for the USMLE
Step 1 is done on a year-round basis. If you have disabilities or special cir-
cumstances, contact the NBME as early as possible to discuss test accommo-
dations (see the Section I Supplement at www.firstaidteam.com/bonus).
Use this time to finalize your ideal schedule. Consider upcoming breaks ` Simulate the USMLE Step 1 under “real”

to make sure you finish at least one question bank. Also add time to redo
missed or flagged questions (which may be half the bank). This is the time to
build a structured plan with enough flexibility for the realities of life.
Begin doing blocks of questions from reputable question banks under “real”
conditions. Don’t use tutor mode until you’re sure you can finish blocks
in the allotted time. It is important to continue balancing success in your
normal studies with the Step 1 test preparation process.
Weeks Prior (Dedicated Preparation)
Your dedicated prep time may be one week or two months. You should have
a working plan as you go into this period. Finish your schoolwork strong, take
a day off, and then get to work. Start by simulating a full-length USMLE
Step 1 if you haven’t yet done so. Consider doing one NBME CBSSA and
the free questions from the NBME website. Alternatively, you could choose 7
blocks of randomized questions from a commercial question bank. Make sure
you get feedback on your strengths and weaknesses and adjust your studying
accordingly. Many students study from review sources or comprehensive

have everything you need to ensure that you will be comfortable and alert at
the test site. It may be beneficial to adjust your schedule to start waking up
at the same time that you will on your test day. And of course, make sure to
maintain a healthy lifestyle and get enough sleep.
One Day Prior
Try your best to relax and rest the night before the test. Double-check your
admissions and test-taking materials as well as the comfort measures discussed
earlier so that you will not have to deal with such details on the morning of
the exam. At this point it will be more effective to review short-term memory
material that you’re already familiar with than to try to learn new material.
The Rapid Review section at the end of this book is high yield for last-minute
studying. Remember that regardless of how hard you have studied, you cannot
(and need not!) know everything. There will be things on the exam that you have
never even seen before, so do not panic. Do not underestimate your abilities.
Many students report difficulty sleeping the night prior to the exam. This is
often exacerbated by going to bed much earlier than usual. Do whatever it
takes to ensure a good night’s sleep (eg, massage, exercise, warm milk, no
screens at night). Do not change your daily routine prior to the exam. Exam
day is not the day for a caffeine-withdrawal headache.

that will allow you to remain comfortable and to concentrate. Get to know
your testing station, especially if you have never been in a Prometric testing
center before. Listen to your proctors regarding any changes in instructions or
testing procedures that may apply to your test site.
If you are experiencing symptoms of illness on the day of your exam, we
strongly recommend you reschedule. If you become ill or show signs of
illness (eg, persistent cough) during the exam, the test center may prohibit
you from completing the exam due to health and safety risks for test center
staff and other examinees.
Finally, remember that it is natural (and even beneficial) to be a little
nervous. Focus on being mentally clear and alert. Avoid panic. When you
are asked to begin the exam, take a deep breath, focus on the screen, and
then begin. Keep an eye on the timer. Take advantage of breaks between
blocks to stretch, maybe do some jumping jacks, and relax for a moment
with deep breathing or stretching.
After the Test
After you have completed the exam, be sure to have fun and relax regardless
of how you may feel. Taking the test is an achievement in itself. Remember,
you are much more likely to have passed than not. Enjoy the free time
you have before your clerkships. Expect to experience some “reentry”
phenomena as you try to regain a real life. Once you have recovered
sufficiently from the test (or from partying), we invite you to send us your
feedback, corrections, and suggestions for entries, facts, mnemonics,
strategies, resource ratings, and the like (see p. xvii, How to Contribute).
Sharing your experience will benefit fellow medical students.
` STUDY MATERIALS
Quality Considerations
Although an ever-increasing number of review books and software are now
available on the market, the quality of such material is highly variable. Some
common problems are as follows:
 Certain review books are too detailed to allow for review in a reasonable
amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the exam.
 Many sample question books were originally written years ago and have
not been adequately updated to reflect recent trends.
 Some question banks test to a level of detail that you will not find on the
exam.

You should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions
reflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes.
Take into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1.
Apps
With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly
popular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are
compatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review
resources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with
their software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer
app versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while
away from a computer (eg, while traveling).
Practice Tests
Taking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths

students use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the
monotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas
other students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to
one or more high-quality question banks.
Additionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to
incorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the
wards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE
Step 1 aims to directly address this need.
After taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer

Textbooks and Course Syllabi
Limit your use of textbooks and course syllabi for Step 1 review. Many
textbooks are too detailed for high-yield review and include material that
is generally not tested on the USMLE Step 1 (eg, drug dosages, complex
chemical structures). Syllabi, although familiar, are inconsistent across
medical schools and frequently reflect the emphasis of individual faculty,
which often does not correspond to that of the USMLE Step 1. Syllabi also
tend to be less organized than top-rated books and generally contain fewer
diagrams and study questions.
Integration of AI in Medical Education: Transforming USMLE Preparation
The integration of AI into education signals a paradigm shift in the
acquisition and application of medical knowledge. AI’s increasing ability to
process extensive data sets and adapt to various learning styles makes it an
attractive tool in medical training and practice.17 Studies have demonstrated
that AI language models are capable of achieving high accuracy rates when
answering USMLE-style questions, underscoring its potential in supporting
medical education.18
Although undeniably powerful, effectively utilizing AI as a study tool
requires both practice and individual trial and error. We suggest the
following approaches and prompts that might help learners more effectively
harness AI for exam preparation:
Tailored Mnemonic Creation: Devise unique mnemonics to aid in
memorizing complex medical terms efficiently. AI models can be highly
creative in generating new ones, although feedback and iteration will likely
be needed to produce mnemonics that are both accurate and memorable.
Example prompt: Create a food-related mnemonic for remembering
adverse effects 1, 2, and 3 of Drug A.
Custom Summarization of Medical Texts: Efficiently condense extensive
medical literature into concise summaries, facilitating efficient and rapid
topic reviews.
Example prompt: Summarize this medical school lecture into bullet
points. Decrease length by 80%.
AI-Generated Custom Quizzes: Create focused practice questions.
Example Prompt: Create three vignette-style multiple choice questions
testing presentations of lysosomal storage disorders.
Clinical Case Simulations: Utilize AI-powered simulations of realistic
clinical scenarios to practice decision-making skills and application of
medical knowledge.
Example prompt: Create an exercise to practice analyzing acid-base
disorders requiring Winter’s formula with step-by-step explanations.

Though both exciting and promising, pitfalls of using AI models for studying
include the potential for outdated information or reliance on data that are
not validated, resulting in a potential source of misinformation. AI can
become unintentionally trained with human biases, and thus produce
results that further reinforce or perpetuate potentially harmful biases. When
using AI for personal studying, always validate information and maintain a
critical eye when creating prompts.
AI is clearly a rapidly evolving study tool, however, how it can be best
integrated with proven study methods remains to be seen. For the most
recent updates on effectively leveraging AI in medical education, we

of these factors. Test-taking skills and strategies should be developed and
perfected well in advance of the test date so that you can concentrate on the
test itself. We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might
work for you.
Pacing
You have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one-
hour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately
90 seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace
yourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure
about the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess,
and move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20 minutes
left after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your
marked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental
and do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental
questions are the ones that are stumping you). In the past, pacing errors have

Dealing with Each Question
There are several established techniques for efficiently approaching
multiple choice questions; find what works for you. One technique begins
with identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal
should be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a
reasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all
impossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and
turn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the
answer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question
(the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only
information relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly
helpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques
on practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed,
remember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.
Guessing
There is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left
with unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate
incorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that
dozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain
statistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual
or unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development
process for future exams.
Changing Your Answer
The conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers.
However, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely
to change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way
around. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed
from right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback

What Is a Clinical Vignette?
A clinical vignette is a short (usually paragraph-long) description of a patient,
including demographics, presenting symptoms, signs, and other information
concerning the patient. Sometimes this paragraph is followed by a brief
listing of important physical findings and/or laboratory results. The task of
` Practice questions that include case histories

preparation.
think on your feet. Remember that the question is often indirectly asking
something you already know.
A pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to
that of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus
the material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the
question. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE
Step 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is
important to answer the associated question correctly.
Strategy
Remember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in
their most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for
lupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that
` Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or
the question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords.
disorders in their most classic presentation.
Sometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm
or reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or
out. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.
Making a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not
infrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have
just struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own.
The question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease.
Consider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long
stem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast
may warp your perception of what the vignette is asking.
` IF YOU THINK YOU FAILED
After taking the test, it is normal for many examinees to feel unsure about
their performance, despite the majority of them achieving a passing score.
Historical pass data are in Table 2. If you remain quite concerned, it may
be wise to prepare a course of action should you need to retest. There are
several sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that
you do not achieve a passing score. First, save and organize all your study
materials, including review books, practice tests, and notes. Familiarize
yourself with the reapplication procedures for Step 1, including application
deadlines and upcoming test dates.

a 12-month period. Your fourth attempt must be at least 12 months after
your first attempt at that exam, and at least 6 months after your most recent
attempt at that exam.
If you failed, the performance profiles in your score report provide
valuable feedback concerning your relative strengths and weaknesses.
Study these profiles closely. Set up a study timeline to strengthen gaps in
your knowledge as well as to maintain and improve what you already know.
Do not neglect high-yield subjects. It is normal to feel somewhat anxious
about retaking the test, but if anxiety becomes a problem, seek appropriate
counseling.

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE
The 2024 edition of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 contains a revised and
expanded database of basic science material that students, student authors,
and faculty authors have identified as high yield for board review. The
information is presented in a partially organ-based format. Hence, Section
II is devoted to the foundational principles of biochemistry, microbiology,
immunology, basic pathology, basic pharmacology, and public health
sciences. Section III focuses on organ systems, with subsections covering
the embryology, anatomy and histology, physiology, clinical pathology, and
clinical pharmacology relevant to each. Each subsection is then divided
into smaller topic areas containing related facts. Individual facts are
generally presented in a three-column format, with the Title of the fact in
the first column, the Description of the fact in the second column, and the
Mnemonic or Special Note in the third column. Some facts do not have a
mnemonic and are presented in a two-column format. Others are presented
in list or tabular form in order to emphasize key associations.
The database structure used in Sections II and III is useful for reviewing
material already learned. These sections are not ideal for learning complex
or highly conceptual material for the first time.
The database of high-yield facts is not comprehensive. Use it to complement
your core study mate rial and not as your primary study source. The facts and
notes have been condensed and edited to emphasize the high-yield material,
and as a result, each entry is “incomplete” and arguably “over-simplified.”
Often, the more you research a topic, the more complex it becomes, with
certain topics resisting simplification. Determine your most efficient
methods for learning the material, and do not be afraid to abandon a strategy
if it is not working for you.
Our database of high-yield facts is updated annually to keep current with
new trends in boards emphasis, including clinical relevance. However, we
must note that inevitably many other high-yield topics are not yet included
in our database.
We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit high-yield
topics, well-written entries, diagrams, clinical images, and useful mnemonics
so that we may enhance the database for future students. We also solicit
recommendations of alternate tools for study that may be useful in preparing
for the examination, such as charts, flash cards, apps, and online resources
(see How to Contribute, p. xv).

This high-yield material includes molecular biology, genetics, cell
biology, and principles of metabolism (especially vitamins, cofactors,
minerals, and single-enzyme-deficiency diseases). When studying
metabolic pathways, emphasize important regulatory steps and enzyme
deficiencies that result in disease, as well as reactions targeted by
pharmacologic interventions. For example, understanding the defect
in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome and its clinical consequences is higher yield
than memorizing every intermediate in the purine salvage pathway.
Do not spend time learning details of organic chemistry, mechanisms, or
physical chemistry. Detailed chemical structures are infrequently tested;
however, many structures have been included here to help students
learn reactions and the important enzymes involved. Familiarity with
the biochemical techniques that have medical relevance—such as
ELISA, immunoelectrophoresis, Southern blotting, and PCR—is
useful. Review the related biochemistry when studying pharmacology or
genetic diseases as a way to reinforce and integrate the material.

Mutations in DNA Degree of change: silent << missense < nonsense < frameshift. Single nucleotide substitutions are
repaired by DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. Types of single nucleotide (point) mutations:
 Transition—purine to purine (eg, A to G) or pyrimidine to pyrimidine (eg, C to T).
 Transversion—purine to pyrimidine (eg, A to T) or pyrimidine to purine (eg, C to G).
Single nucleotide substitutions
Silent mutation Codes for same (synonymous) amino acid; often involves 3rd position of codon (tRNA wobble).
Missense mutation Results in changed amino acid (called conservative if new amino acid has similar chemical
structure). Examples: sickle cell disease (substitution of glutamic acid with valine).
Nonsense mutation Results in early stop codon (UGA, UAA, UAG). Usually generates nonfunctional protein. Stop the
nonsense!
Other mutations
Frameshift mutation Deletion or insertion of any number of nucleotides not divisible by 3  misreading of all
nucleotides downstream. Protein may be shorter or longer, and its function may be disrupted or
altered. May occur due to slippage of DNA polymerase during replication at repetitive nucleotide
regions. Examples: Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis.

T-arm: contains the TΨC (ribothymidine, pseudouridine, cytidine) sequence necessary for tRNA-
ribosome binding. T-arm Tethers tRNA molecule to ribosome.
D-arm: contains Dihydrouridine residues necessary for tRNA recognition by the correct aminoacyl-
tRNA synthetase. D-arm allows Detection of the tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.
Attachment site: 3′-ACC-5′ is the amino acid ACCeptor site.
Charging Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (uses ATP; 1 unique enzyme per respective amino acid) and
binding of charged tRNA to the codon are responsible for the accuracy of amino acid selection.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase matches an amino acid to the tRNA by scrutinizing the amino acid
before and after it binds to tRNA. If an incorrect amino acid is attached, the bond is hydrolyzed.
A mischarged tRNA reads the usual codon but inserts the wrong amino acid.

Enzyme terminology An enzyme’s name often describes its function. For example, glucokinase is an enzyme that
catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose using a molecule of ATP. The following are commonly
used enzyme descriptors.
Kinase Catalyzes transfer of a phosphate group from a high-energy molecule (usually ATP) to a substrate
(eg, phosphofructokinase).
Phosphorylase Adds inorganic phosphate onto substrate without using ATP (eg, glycogen phosphorylase).
Phosphatase Removes phosphate group from substrate (eg, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1).
Dehydrogenase Catalyzes oxidation-reduction reactions (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase).
Hydroxylase Adds hydroxyl group (−OH) onto substrate (eg, tyrosine hydroxylase).
Carboxylase Transfers carboxyl groups (−COOH) with the help of biotin (eg, pyruvate carboxylase).
Mutase Relocates a functional group within a molecule (eg, vitamin B –dependent methylmalonyl-CoA
12
mutase).
Synthase Catalyzes synthesis reactions without using ATP as a source of energy

Sorbitol An alternative method of trapping glucose in the cell is to convert it to its alcohol counterpart,
sorbitol, via aldose reductase. Some tissues then convert sorbitol to fructose using sorbitol
dehydrogenase; tissues with an insufficient amount/activity of this enzyme are at risk of
intracellular sorbitol accumulation, causing osmotic damage (eg, cataracts, retinopathy, and
peripheral neuropathy seen with chronic hyperglycemia in diabetes).
High blood levels of galactose also result in conversion to the osmotically active galactitol via aldose

Cholesterol is needed to maintain cell membrane integrity and synthesize bile acids, steroids, and
vitamin D.
Chylomicron Delivers dietary TGs to peripheral tissues. Delivers cholesterol to liver in the form of chylomicron
remnants, which are mostly depleted of their TGs. Secreted by intestinal epithelial cells.
VLDL Delivers hepatic TGs to peripheral tissue. Secreted by liver.
IDL Delivers TGs and cholesterol to liver. Formed from degradation of VLDL.
LDL Delivers hepatic cholesterol to peripheral tissues. Formed by hepatic lipase modification of IDL in
the liver and peripheral tissue. Taken up by target cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL is
Lethal.
HDL Mediates reverse cholesterol transport from peripheral tissues to liver. Acts as a repository for apoC
and apoE (which are needed for chylomicron and VLDL metabolism). Secreted from both liver
and intestine. Alcohol  synthesis. HDL is Healthy.
Abetalipoproteinemia Autosomal recessive. Mutation in gene that encodes microsomal transfer protein (MTP).
Chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL absent. Deficiency in apo B – and apo B –containing lipoproteins.

Affected infants present with severe fat malabsorption, steatorrhea, failure to thrive. Later
manifestations include retinitis pigmentosa, spinocerebellar degeneration due to vitamin E

Activity enhanced by IL-2, IL-12, IFN-α, and IFN-β.
Induced to kill when exposed to a nonspecific activation signal on target cell and/or to an absence
of an inhibitory signal such as MHC I on target cell surface.
Also kills via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CD16 binds Fc region of bound IgG,
activating the NK cell).
Major functions of B and T cells
B cells Humoral immunity.
Recognize and present antigen—undergo somatic hypermutation to optimize antigen specificity.
Produce antibody—differentiate into plasma cells to secrete specific immunoglobulins.
Maintain immunologic memory—memory B cells persist and accelerate future response to antigen.
T cells Cell-mediated immunity.
CD4+ T cells help B cells make antibodies and produce cytokines to recruit phagocytes and
activate other leukocytes.
CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected and tumor cells via perforin and granzymes (similar to NK
cells).
Type IV hypersensitivity reaction.

selection selection
Positive selection Thymic cortex. Keeps T cells that recognize self-peptides to allow for cooperation in immune
responses. Double positive thymocytes expressing TCRs that recognize self-peptide MHC
complexes receive a survival signal.
Negative selection Thymic medulla. Removes T cells that bind too strongly to self-peptides. Thymocytes expressing
TCRs with high affinity for self antigens undergo apoptosis or become regulatory T cells. The
autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein drives negative selection, and deficiency leads to autoimmune
polyendocrine syndrome (Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, Hypoparathyroidism, Adrenal
insufficiency, Recurrent Candida infections). “Without AIRE, your body will CHAR”.
Macrophage- Th1 cells secrete IFN-γ, which enhances the ability of monocytes and macrophages to kill
lymphocyte microbes they ingest. This function is also enhanced by interaction of T cell CD40L with CD40
interaction on macrophages. Macrophages also activate lymphocytes via antigen presentation.
Cytotoxic T cells Kill virus-infected, neoplastic, and donor graft cells by inducing apoptosis.
Release cytotoxic granules containing preformed proteins (eg, perforin, granzyme B).
Cytotoxic T cells have CD8, which binds to MHC I on virus-infected cells.
Regulatory T cells Help maintain specific immune tolerance by suppressing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell effector
functions.
Identified by expression of CD3, CD4, CD25, and FOXP3.

Interferons IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ.
mechanISm A part of innate host defense, interferons interfere with both RNA and DNA viruses. Cells
infected with a virus synthesize these glycoproteins, which act on local cells, priming them
for viral defense by downregulating protein synthesis to resist potential viral replication and by
upregulating MHC expression to facilitate recognition of infected cells. Also play a major role in
activating antitumor immunity.

Microbiology questions on the Step 1 exam often require two (or
more) steps: Given a certain clinical presentation, you will first need
to identify the most likely causative organism, and you will then need to
provide an answer regarding some features of that organism or relevant
antimicrobial agents. For example, a description of a child with fever
and a petechial rash will be followed by a question that reads, “From
what site does the responsible organism usually enter the blood?”
This section therefore presents organisms in two major ways: in
individual microbial “profiles” and in the context of the systems
they infect and the clinical presentations they produce. You should
become familiar with both formats. When reviewing the systems
approach, remind yourself of the features of each microbe by returning
to the individual profiles. Also be sure to memorize the laboratory
characteristics that allow you to identify microbes.

progress to necrotizing fasciitis in high-risk patients, especially those with high serum iron (eg,
cirrhosis, hemochromatosis). Serious wound infection requires surgical debridement.

Opportunistic fungal infections
Candida albicans alba = white. Dimorphic; forms pseudohyphae and budding yeasts at 20°C A, germ tubes at
37°C B.
Systemic or superficial fungal infection. Causes oral C and esophageal thrush in
immunocompromised (neonates, steroids, diabetes, AIDS), vulvovaginitis (diabetes, use of
antibiotics), diaper rash, infective endocarditis (people who inject drugs), disseminated candidiasis
(especially in neutropenic patients as host defense relies on phagocytes), chronic mucocutaneous
candidiasis.
Treatment: oral fluconazole/topical azoles for vaginal; nystatin, azoles, or, rarely, echinocandins for
oral; fluconazole, echinocandins, or amphotericin B for esophageal or systemic disease.
Aspergillus Acute angle (45°) D branching of septate hyphae.
fumigatus Causes invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised patients, especially those with neutrophil
dysfunction (eg, chronic granulomatous disease) because Aspergillus is catalase ⊕.
Can cause aspergillomas E in pre-existing lung cavities, especially after TB infection.
Some species of Aspergillus produce aflatoxins (induce TP53 mutations leading to hepatocellular
carcinoma).
Treatment: voriconazole or echinocandins (2nd-line).
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)—hypersensitivity response to Aspergillus growing in
lung mucus. Associated with asthma and cystic fibrosis; may cause bronchiectasis and eosinophilia.
Cryptococcus 5–10 μm with narrow budding. Heavily encapsulated yeast. Not dimorphic. ⊕ PAS staining.
neoformans Found in soil, pigeon droppings. Acquired through inhalation with hematogenous dissemination
to meninges. Highlighted with India ink (clear halo F) and mucicarmine (red inner capsule G).
Latex agglutination test detects polysaccharide capsular antigen and is more sensitive and specific.
Causes cryptococcosis, which can manifest with meningitis, pneumonia, and/or encephalitis (“soap
bubble” lesions in brain), primarily in immunocompromised.
Treatment: amphotericin B + flucytosine followed by fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis.
Mucor and Rhizopus Irregular, broad, nonseptate hyphae branching at wide angles H.

Prions Prion diseases are caused by the conversion of a normal (predominantly α-helical) protein termed
prion protein (PrPc) to a β-pleated form (PrPsc), which is transmissible via CNS-related tissue
(iatrogenic CJD) or food contaminated by BSE-infected animal products (variant CJD). PrPsc
resists protease degradation and facilitates the conversion of still more PrPc to PrPsc. Resistant to
standard sterilizing procedures, including standard autoclaving. Accumulation of PrPsc results in
spongiform encephalopathy and dementia, ataxia, startle myoclonus, and death.
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease—rapidly progressive dementia, typically sporadic (some familial forms).
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy—also called “mad cow disease.”

“Digressions, objections, delight in mockery, carefree mistrust are signs of ` Cellular Injury 202

“You cannot separate passion from pathology any more than you can ` Neoplasia 215

“My business is not prognosis, but diagnosis. I am not engaged in
therapeutics, but in pathology.”
—H.L. Mencken
The fundamental principles of pathology are key to understanding
diseases in all organ systems. Major topics such as inflammation and
neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems,
and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of
cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory
response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of
board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes
that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example,
esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Make sure you recognize the
major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer
concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis. Finally, take some time
to learn about the major systemic changes that come with aging, and
how these physiologic alterations differ from disease states.

Cellular adaptations Reversible changes that can be physiologic (eg, uterine enlargement during pregnancy) or pathologic

denervation, loss of blood supply, loss of hormonal stimulation, poor nutrition.
Metaplasia Reprogramming of stem cells  replacement of one cell type by another that can adapt to a new
stressor. Usually due to exposure to an irritant, such as gastric acid ( esophageal epithelium
replaced by intestinal epithelium, called Barrett esophagus) or tobacco smoke ( respiratory
ciliated columnar epithelium replaced by stratified squamous epithelium). May progress to
dysplasia  malignant transformation with persistent insult (eg, Barrett esophagus  esophageal
adenocarcinoma). Metaplasia of connective tissue can also occur (eg, myositis ossificans, the
formation of bone within muscle after trauma).
Dysplasia Disordered, precancerous epithelial cell growth; not considered a true adaptive response.
Characterized by loss of uniformity of cell size and shape (pleomorphism); loss of tissue
orientation; nuclear changes (eg,  nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio and clumped chromatin). Mild and
moderate dysplasias (ie, do not involve entire thickness of epithelium) may regress with alleviation
of inciting cause. Severe dysplasia often becomes irreversible and progresses to carcinoma in situ.

Free radical injury Free radicals damage cells via membrane lipid peroxidation, protein modification, DNA breakage.
Initiated via radiation exposure (eg, cancer therapy), metabolism of drugs (phase I), redox
reactions, nitric oxide (eg, inflammation), transition metals (eg, iron, copper; form free radicals

Tumor nomenclature Carcinoma implies epithelial origin, whereas sarcoma denotes mesenchymal origin. Both terms
generally imply malignancy.
Benign tumors are usually well-differentiated and well-demarcated, with low mitotic activity, no
metastases, and no necrosis.
Malignant tumors (cancers) may show poor differentiation, erratic growth, local invasion,
metastasis, and  apoptosis.
Terms for non-neoplastic malformations include hamartoma (disorganized overgrowth of tissues in
their native location, eg, Peutz-Jeghers polyps) and choristoma (normal tissue in a foreign location,
eg, gastric tissue located in distal ileum in Meckel diverticulum).

Limitless replicative Reactivation of telomerase  maintenance and lengthening of telomeres  prevention of
potential chromosome shortening and cell aging.
Sustained  pro-angiogenic factors (eg, VEGF) or  inhibitory factors. Factors may be produced by tumor or
angiogenesis stromal cells. Vessels can sprout from existing capillaries (neoangiogenesis) or endothelial cells are
recruited from bone marrow (vasculogenesis). Vessels may be leaky and/or dilated.
Warburg effect Shift of glucose metabolism away from mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis,
even in the presence of oxygen. Aerobic glycolysis provides rapidly dividing cancer cells with the
carbon needed for synthesis of cellular structures.
Immune evasion in Normally, immune cells can recognize and attack tumor cells. For successful tumorigenesis, tumor
cancer cells must evade the immune system. Multiple escape mechanisms exist:
  MHC class I expression by tumor cells  cytotoxic T cells are unable to recognize tumor
cells.
 Tumor cells secrete immunosuppressive factors (eg, TGF-β) and recruit regulatory T cells to
down regulate immune response.
 Tumor cells up regulate immune checkpoint molecules, which inhibit immune response.
Tissue invasion Loss of E-cadherin function  loosening of intercellular junctions  metalloproteinases degrade
basement membrane and ECM  cells attach to ECM proteins (eg, laminin, fibronectin)  cells
migrate through degraded ECM (“locomotion”)  vascular dissemination.
Metastasis Tumor cells or emboli spread via lymphatics or blood  adhesion to endothelium  extravasation
and homing. Site of metastasis can be predicted by site of 1° tumor, as the target organ is often the
first-encountered capillary bed. Some cancers show organ tropism (eg, lung cancers commonly
metastasize to adrenals).

Preparation for pharmacology questions is not as straightforward as
in years past. One major recent change is that the USMLE Step 1 has
moved away from testing pharmacotherapeutics. That means you will
generally not be required to identify medications indicated for a specific
condition. You still need to know mechanisms and important adverse
effects of key drugs and their major variants. Obscure derivatives are low-
yield. Learn their classic and distinguishing toxicities as well as major
drug-drug interactions.
Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology
concepts can be useful while studying pharmacology. The exam has a
strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents
as well as on NSAIDs, which are covered throughout the text. Specific
drug dosages or trade names are generally not testable. The exam may
use graphs to test various pharmacology content, so make sure you are
comfortable interpreting them.

—Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club ` Healthcare Delivery 275
A heterogenous mix of epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, law, healthcare
delivery, patient safety, quality improvement, and more falls under the
heading of public health sciences. Biostatistics and epidemiology are the
foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make
sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity,
specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also,
know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables, and beware questions that
switch the columns. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were
introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health
system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of
principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then
asked how you would respond. In this edition, we provide further details
on communication skills and patient care given their growing emphasis
on the exam. Effective communication is essential to the physician-
patient partnership. Physicians must seek opportunities to connect with
patients, understand their perspectives, express empathy, and form
shared decisions and realistic goals.

Clinical therapeutic Experimental study involving humans. Compares therapeutic benefits of ≥ 2 interventions (eg,
trial treatment vs placebo, treatment vs treatment). Study quality improves when clinical trial is
randomized, controlled, and double-blinded (ie, neither subject nor researcher knows whether
the subject is in the treatment or control group). Triple-blind refers to additional blinding of the
researchers analyzing the data.
Crossover clinical trial—compares the effect of a series of ≥ 2 treatments on a subject. Order in
which subjects receive treatments is randomized. Washout period occurs between treatments.
Allows subjects to serve as their own controls.
Intention-to-treat analysis—all subjects are analyzed according to their original, randomly assigned
treatment. No one is excluded, ie, once randomized, always analyzed. Attempts to avoid bias from
attrition, crossover, and nonrandom noncompliance, but may dilute the true effects of intervention.

Bradford Hill criteria A group of principles that provide limited support (ie, necessary but not sufficient criteria) for
establishing evidence of a causal relationship between presumed cause and effect.
Strength Association does not necessarily imply causation, but the stronger the association, the more
evidence for causation.
Consistency Repeated observations of the findings in multiple distinct samples.
Specificity The more specific the presumed cause is to the effect, the stronger the evidence for causation.
Temporality The presumed cause precedes the effect by an expected amount of time.
Biological gradient Greater effect observed with greater exposure to the presumed cause (dose-response relationship).
Plausibility A conceivable mechanism exists by which the cause may lead to the effect.
Coherence The presumed cause and effect do not conflict with existing scientific consensus.
Experiment Empirical evidence supporting the presumed cause and effect (eg, animal studies, in vitro studies).
Analogy The presumed cause and effect are comparable to a similar, established cause and effect.

Clinical significance—measure of effect on treatment outcomes. An intervention with high clinical
significance is likely to have a large impact on patient outcomes/measures.
Some studies have a very high statistical significance, but the proposed intervention may have
limited clinical impact/significance, eg, a study might show a statistical significance of lowered
blood sugar levels by 1 mg/dL correlated with better outcomes, but this may not be clinically as
important.

Core ethical principles
Autonomy Obligation to respect patients as individuals (truth-telling, confidentiality), to create conditions
necessary for autonomous choice (informed consent), and to honor their preference in accepting
or not accepting medical care.
Beneficence “Do good.” Physicians have a special ethical (fiduciary) duty to act in the patient’s best interest.
May conflict with autonomy (an informed patient has the right to decide) or what is best for
society (eg, mandatory TB treatment). Traditionally, patient interest supersedes.
Principle of double effect—facilitating comfort is prioritized over potential side effects (eg,
respiratory depression with opioid use) for patients receiving end-of-life care.
Nonmaleficence “Do no harm.” Must be balanced against beneficence; if the benefits outweigh the risks, a patient
may make an informed decision to proceed (most surgeries and medications fall into this category).
Justice To treat persons fairly and equitably. This does not always imply equally (eg, triage).
Decision-making Physician must determine whether the patient is Four major components of decision-making:
capacity psychologically and legally capable of making  Understanding (what do you know about

consent) even if their consent is not required.
Advance directives Instructions given by a patient in anticipation of the need for a medical decision. Details vary per
state law.
Oral advance directive Incapacitated patient’s prior oral statements commonly used as guide. Problems arise from variance
in interpretation. If patient was informed, directive was specific, patient made a choice, and
decision was repeated over time to multiple people, then the oral directive is more valid.
Written advance Delineates specific healthcare interventions that patient anticipates accepting or rejecting during
directive treatment for a critical or life-threatening illness. A living will is an example.
Medical power of Patient designates an agent to make medical decisions in the event that the patient loses decision-
attorney making capacity. Patient may also specify decisions in clinical situations. Can be revoked by
patient if decision-making capacity is intact. More flexible than a living will.

Ventilator-assisted life Ideally, discussions with patients occur before ventilator support is necessary. However, information
support about patient preferences may be absent at the time patients require this intervention to survive.
Medical decision-making frequently relies on surrogate decision-makers (patient identified or
legally appointed) when discussing the continuation or withdrawal of ventilatory support, focusing
on both the prognosis of the condition and the believed wishes of the patient.
If surrogates indicate patient would not have wanted to receive life support with ventilation 
withhold or withdraw life support regardless of what the surrogate prefers.
If the decision is made to withhold or withdraw life support, involve palliative care, chaplain services,
and the primary care physician in medical discussions with the family and provide emotional support.
Surrogate decision- If a patient loses decision-making capacity and has not prepared an advance directive, individuals
maker (surrogates) who know the patient must determine what the patient would have done. Priority
of surrogates: spouse  adult children  parents  adult siblings  other relatives (the spouse
chips in).
Confidentiality Confidentiality respects patient privacy and autonomy. If the patient is incapacitated or the
situation is emergent, disclosing information to family and friends should be guided by
professional judgment of patient’s best interest. The patient may voluntarily waive the right to
confidentiality (eg, insurance company request).
General principles for exceptions to confidentiality:
 Potential physical harm to self or others is serious and imminent
 Alternative means to warn or protect those at risk is not possible
 Steps can be taken to prevent harm
Examples of exceptions to patient confidentiality (many are state specific) include the following
(“The physician’s good judgment SAVED the day”):
 Patients with active Suicidal/homicidal ideation
 Abuse (children, older adults, and/or prisoners)
 Duty to protect—state-specific laws that sometimes allow physician to inform or somehow
protect potential Victim from harm
 Patients with Epilepsy and other impaired automobile drivers
 Reportable Diseases (eg, STIs, hepatitis, food poisoning); physicians may have a duty to warn
public officials, who will then notify people at risk. Dangerous communicable diseases, such as
TB or Ebola, may require involuntary treatment.
Accepting gifts from A complex subject without definitive regulations. Some argue that the patient-physician
patients relationship is strengthened through accepting a gift from a patient, while others argue that
negative consequences outweigh the benefits of accepting any gift.
In practice, patients often present items such as cards, baked goods, and inexpensive gifts to
physicians. The physician’s decision to accept or decline is based on an individual assessment of
whether or not the risk of harm outweighs the potential benefit.
 Physicians should not accept gifts that are inappropriately large or valuable.
 Gifts should not be accepted if the physician identifies that the gift could detrimentally affect
patient care.
 Gifts that may cause emotional or financial stress for the patient should not be accepted.
If a gift violates any of the guidelines above, the best practice is to thank the patient for offering
a kind gift, but politely indicate that it must be declined. During this conversation it should be
emphasized that the incident does not influence the physician-patient relationship in any way.

Patient-centered interviewing techniques
Introduction Introduce yourself and ask the patient their name and how they would like to be addressed. Address
the patient by the name and pronouns given. Avoid making gender assumptions. Sit at eye level,
near the patient, while facing them directly.
Agenda setting Identify concerns and set goals by developing joint agenda between the physician and the patient.
Reflection Actively listen and synthesize information offered by the patient, particularly with respect to
primary concern(s).
Validation Legitimize or affirm the patient’s perspectives.
Recapitulation Summarize what the patient has said so far to ensure correct interpretation.
Facilitation Encourage the patient to speak freely without guiding responses or leading questions. Allow the
patient to ask questions throughout the encounter.
Establishing rapport PEARLS
Partnership Work together with patient to identify primary concerns and develop preferred solutions.
Empathy Acknowledge the emotions displayed and demonstrate understanding of why the patient is feeling
that way.
Apology Take personal responsibility when appropriate.
Respect Commend the patient for coming in to discuss a problem, pushing through challenging
circumstances, keeping a positive attitude, or other constructive behaviors.
Legitimization Assure patient that emotional responses are understandable or common.
Support Reassure patient that you will work together through difficult times and offer appropriate resources.
Delivering bad news SPIKES
Setting Offer in advance for the patient to bring support. Eliminate distractions, ensure privacy, and sit
down with the patient to talk.
Perception Determine the patient’s understanding and expectations of the situation.
Invitation Obtain the patient’s permission to disclose the news and what level of detail is desired.
Knowledge Share the information in small pieces without medical jargon, allowing time to process. Assess the
patient’s understanding.
Emotions Acknowledge the patient’s emotions, and provide opportunity to express them. Listen and offer
empathetic responses.
Strategy If the patient feels ready, discuss treatment options and goals of care. Offer an agenda for the next
appointment. Giving control to the patient may be empowering. Ask how they feel a problem
might be solved and what they would like to do about the plan of action.

Gender- and sexuality- Avoid making assumptions about sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and
inclusive history behavior (eg, a patient who identifies as heterosexual may engage in same-sex sexual activity).
taking Use gender-neutral terms when referring to the patient or the patient’s family (eg, “partner” rather
than “husband” or “wife”) upon first meeting the patient until the patient instructs otherwise or
uses specific pronouns. A patient’s assigned sex at birth and gender identity may differ. Do not
bring up gender or sexuality if it is not relevant to the visit (eg, a gender-nonconforming patient
seeking care for a hand laceration).
Consider stating what pronouns you use when you introduce yourself (eg, “I’m Dr. Smith, and I use she/
her pronouns”) and asking patients how they would like to be addressed. Also consider ways of being
inclusive (eg, ensuring correct name and pronouns are in the EMR).
Reassure them about the confidentiality of their visits and be sensitive to the fact that patients may
not be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity to others in their life.
Remember: trust is built over time, and listening to and learning from patients about how they
would like to approach the topics discussed above is key.
Cultural formulation Identify the problem through the patient’s perspective. Ask the patient to describe the problem in
interview their own words, or how the patient would describe the problem to their family and friends.
Identify cultural perceptions of factors leading to a problem. Ask the patient to explain why they
think they are experiencing their problem.
Identify how the patient’s background influences their problem. Ask the patient about what makes
their problem better or worse. Investigate roles of family, community, and spirituality.
Identify how culture may impact current and future interventions. Ask the patient if they have any
concerns or suggestions about the current plan of treatment. If they do not want to follow medical
advice, investigate if there is a way to combine their plans with the standard medical regimen.
Identify possible barriers to care based on culture. Ask the patient if there is anything that would
prevent them from seeking care in a standard medical institution. Probe for explanations and
what may increase the chance of maintaining a good patient-physician relationship.
Motivational Counseling technique to facilitate behavior modification by helping patients resolve ambivalence
interviewing about change. Useful for many conditions (eg, nicotine dependence, obesity). Helpful when
patient has some desire to change, but it does not require that the patient be committed to making
the change. May involve asking patients to examine how their behavior interferes with their life
or why they might want to change it. Assess barriers (eg, food access, untreated trauma) that may
make behavior change difficult.
Assessing a patient’s readiness for change is also important for guiding physician-suggested goals.
These goals should be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time bound (SMART).
Trauma-informed care Patients with history of psychological trauma should receive thorough behavioral health screenings.
Regularly assess mood, substance use, social supports, and suicide risk.
Focus assessments on trauma-related symptoms that interfere with social and occupational
function. Always be empathetic. Do not ask invasive questions requiring the patient to describe
trauma in detail. Ask permission prior to discussion.
Before the physical exam, reassure patients that they may signal to end it immediately if they
experience too much physical or emotional discomfort. Offer the presence of additional staff for
support. Psychological counseling may be indicated. Follow-up counseling is offered (or advised)
as appropriate. Remember 4 R’s: Realize, Recognize, Respond, Resist retraumatization.

Use of interpreters Visits with a patient who speaks little English should utilize a professionally trained medical
interpreter unless the physician is conversationally fluent in the patient’s preferred language. If an
interpreter is unavailable in person, interpretation services may be provided by telephone or video
call. If the patient prefers to utilize a family member, this should be recorded in the chart.
Do not assume that a patient is a poor English speaker because of name, skin tone, or accent. Ask
the patient what language is preferred.
The physician should make eye contact with the patient and speak to them directly, without use of
third-person statements such as “tell him.”
Allow extra time for the interview, and ask one question at a time.
For in-person spoken language interpretation, the interpreter should ideally be next to or slightly
behind the patient. For sign language interpretation, the interpreter should be next to or slightly
behind the physician.
In cases of emergency, facilitate communication by any tools available (eg, friends, family, sketches,
interpreter apps) even though they do not comprise standard procedure otherwise.

Healthcare payment models
Bundled payment Healthcare organization receives a set amount per service, regardless of ultimate cost, to be divided
among all providers and facilities involved.
Capitation Physicians receive a set amount per patient assigned to them per period of time, regardless of how
much the patient uses the healthcare system. Used by some HMOs.
Discounted fee-for- Insurer and/or patient pays for each individual service at a discounted rate predetermined by
service providers and payers (eg, PPOs).
Fee-for-service Insurer and/or patient pays for each individual service.
Global payment Insurer and/or patient pays for all expenses associated with a single incident of care with a single
payment. Most commonly used during elective surgeries, as it covers the cost of surgery as well as
the necessary pre- and postoperative visits.

SECTION III HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS
` APPROACHING THE ORGAN SYSTEMS
In this section, we have divided the High-Yield Facts into the major Organ
Systems. Within each Organ System are several subsections, including
Embryology, Anatomy, Physiology, Pathology, and Pharmacology. As
you progress through each Organ System, refer back to information in
the previous subsections to organize these basic science subsections into a
“vertically integrated” framework for learning. Below is some general advice
for studying the organ systems by these subsections.
Embryology
Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology
tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to
congenital malformations.
Anatomy
Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology,
and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do
not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned
and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more
steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section,
electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an
understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.
While studying, emphasize clinically relevant material. For example, be
familiar with gross anatomy and radiologic anatomy r elated to specific diseases
(eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures,
sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and
common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on
the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students
suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and
histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body
(eg, sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis).
Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional
anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good
yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for
illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.
Physiology
The portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept
oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams
are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of
questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams. Learn to apply basic
physiologic relationships in a variety of ways (eg, the Fick equation, clearance
equations). You are seldom asked to perform complex calculations. Hormones

HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS HIGH-YIELD ORGAN SYSTEMS SECTION III
are the focus of many questions; learn where and how they are synthesized,
their regulatory mechanisms and sites of action.
A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically
relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with
pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD).
Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with
common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys,
GI tract) and endocrine glands.
Pathology
Questions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because
of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and
hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of
Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of
certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must
also recognize the clinical descriptions of these high-yield physical exam
findings.
Given the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to
review the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as
their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and
pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United
States (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure,
ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step
beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications.
The examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and
photographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief
clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before
looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the
pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color
atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days
before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity,
occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.
Pharmacology
Preparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning
all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use,
and important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the
prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn
the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother
with drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry,
physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology.
There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular
agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer
drugs on the market are also fair game.

The cardiovascular system is one of the highest yield areas for the
boards and, for some students, may be the most challenging. Focusing
on understanding the mechanisms instead of memorizing the details
can make a big difference. Pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and heart
failure, mechanism of action of drugs (particularly, their interplay with
cardiac physiology) and their adverse effects, ECGs of heart blocks,
the cardiac cycle, and the Starling curve are some of the more high-
yield topics. Differentiating between systolic and diastolic dysfunction
is also very important. Heart murmurs and maneuvers that affect these
murmurs have also been high yield and may be asked in a multimedia
format.

The endocrine system comprises widely distributed organs that work in a
highly integrated manner to orchestrate a state of hormonal equilibrium
within the body. Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be
classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction,
or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which
themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction
of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the
glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating
disease manifestations with diagnosis and management. Take time to
learn the multisystem connections.

Findings: moderately enlarged, nontender thyroid. May be preceded by transient hyperthyroid
state (“Hashitoxicosis”) due to follicular rupture and thyroid hormone release.
Serology: ⊕ antithyroid peroxidase (antimicrosomal) and antithyroglobulin antibodies.
Histology: Hürthle cells A, lymphoid aggregates with germinal centers B.

3
anaplastic carcinoma.
Findings: slowly enlarging, hard (rocklike), fixed, nontender thyroid.
Histology: thyroid replaced by fibrous tissue and inflammatory infiltrate D.
Congenital Formerly called cretinism. Most commonly caused by thyroid dysgenesis (abnormal thyroid gland
hypothyroidism development; eg, agenesis, hypoplasia, ectopy) or dyshormonogenesis (abnormal thyroid hormone
synthesis; eg, mutations in thyroid peroxidase) in iodine-sufficient regions.
Findings (6 P’s): pot-bellied, pale, puffy-faced child E with protruding umbilicus, protuberant
tongue F, and poor brain development.
Other causes Iodine deficiency (most common cause worldwide; typically presents with goiter G), iodine excess

Hyperaldosteronism Increased secretion of aldosterone from adrenal gland. Clinical features include hypertension,
 or normal K+, metabolic alkalosis. 1° hyperaldosteronism does not directly cause edema due
to aldosterone escape mechanism. However, certain 2° causes of hyperaldosteronism (eg, heart
failure) impair the aldosterone escape mechanism, leading to worsening of edema.
Primary Seen in patients with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia or adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome).

Neuroendocrine Heterogeneous group of neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells (which have traits similar
tumors to nerve cells and hormone-producing cells).
Most neoplasms occur in the GI system (eg, carcinoid, gastrinoma), pancreas (eg, insulinoma,
glucagonoma), and lungs (eg, small cell carcinoma). Also in thyroid (eg, medullary carcinoma)
and adrenals (eg, pheochromocytoma).
Neuroendocrine cells (eg, pancreatic β cells, enterochromaffin cells) share a common biologic
function through amine precursor uptake decarboxylase (APUD) despite differences in
embryologic origin, anatomic site, and secretory products (eg, chromogranin A, neuron-specific
enolase [NSE], synaptophysin, serotonin, histamine, calcitonin). Treatment: surgical resection,
somatostatin analogs.
Neuroblastoma Most common solid extracranial tumor in children (typically < 4 years old). Usually arises in
adrenal medulla, but may occur anywhere along the sympathetic chain. Originates from neural

Most common presentation is abdominal distension and a firm, irregular mass that can cross the
midline (vs Wilms tumor, which is smooth and unilateral). Less likely to develop hypertension
than with pheochromocytoma (neuroblastoma is normotensive). Can also present with
opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (“dancing eyes-dancing feet”).

affected by various pathologies. Study not only disease pathophysiology,
but also its specific findings, so that you can differentiate between
two similar diseases. For example, what specifically makes ulcerative

Associated with salivary stasis (eg, dehydration) and trauma.
Presents as recurrent pre-/periprandial pain and swelling in affected gland.
Sialadenitis Inflammation of salivary gland due to obstruction, infection (eg, S aureus, mumps virus), or
immune-mediated mechanisms (eg, Sjögren syndrome).
Salivary gland tumors Usually benign and most commonly affect the parotid gland. Submandibular, sublingual, and
minor salivary gland tumors are more likely to be malignant. Typically present as painless mass/
swelling. Facial paralysis or pain suggests malignant involvement.
 Pleomorphic adenoma (benign mixed tumor)—most common salivary gland tumor D.
Composed of chondromyxoid stroma and epithelium and recurs if incompletely excised or
ruptured intraoperatively. May undergo malignant transformation.
 Warthin tumor (papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum)—benign cystic tumor with germinal

Inflammatory Due to mucosal erosion in inflammatory bowel disease.
pseudopolyps
Mucosal polyps Small, usually < 5 mm. Look similar to normal mucosa. Clinically insignificant.
Submucosal polyps May include lipomas, leiomyomas, fibromas, and other lesions.
Potentially malignant
Adenomatous polyps Neoplastic, via chromosomal instability pathway with mutations in APC and KRAS. Tubular B
histology has less malignant potential than villous C (“villous histology is villainous”); tubulovillous
has intermediate malignant potential. Usually asymptomatic; may present with occult bleeding.
Serrated polyps Neoplastic. Characterized by CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP; cytosine base followed by
guanine, linked by a phosphodiester bond). Defect may silence mismatch repair gene (eg, MLH1)
expression. Mutations lead to microsatellite instability and mutations in BRAF. “Saw-tooth”
pattern of crypts on biopsy. Up to 20% of cases of sporadic CRC.

Sessile Pedunculated
Polyposis syndromes
Familial adenomatous Autosomal dominant mutation of APC tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 5q21-q22. 2-hit
polyposis hypothesis. Thousands of polyps arise starting after puberty; pancolonic; always involves rectum.
Prophylactic colectomy or else 100% progress to CRC.
Gardner syndrome FAP + osseous and soft tissue tumors (eg, osteomas of skull or mandible), congenital hypertrophy of
retinal pigment epithelium, impacted/supernumerary teeth.
Turcot syndrome FAP or Lynch syndrome + malignant CNS tumor (eg, medulloblastoma, glioma). Turcot = Turban.
Peutz-Jeghers Autosomal dominant syndrome featuring numerous hamartomatous polyps throughout GI tract,

ePiDemiology Most patients are > 50 years old. ~ 25% have a family history.
risK FaCtors Adenomatous and serrated polyps, familial cancer syndromes, IBD, tobacco use, diet of processed
meat with low fiber.
Presentation Rectosigmoid > ascending > descending.
Most are asymptomatic. Right side (cecal, ascending) associated with occult bleeding; left side
(rectosigmoid) associated with hematochezia and obstruction (narrower lumen   stool caliber).
Ascending—exophytic mass, iron deficiency anemia, weight loss.
Descending—infiltrating mass, partial obstruction, colicky pain, hematochezia.
Can present with S bovis (gallolyticus) bacteremia/endocarditis or as an episode of diverticulitis.
Diagnosis Iron deficiency anemia in males (especially > 50 years old) and postmenopausal females raises
A suspicion.
Screening:
 Average risk: screen at age 45 with colonoscopy (polyp seen in A); alternatives include flexible
sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), fecal immunochemical testing (FIT),
FIT-fecal DNA, CT colonography.
 Patients with a first-degree relative who has colon cancer: screen at age 40 with colonoscopy, or
10 years prior to the relative’s presentation.
 Patients with IBD: screen 8 years after onset.
B
“Apple core” lesion seen on barium enema x-ray B.
CEA tumor marker: good for monitoring recurrence, should not be used for screening.
Molecular Chromosomal instability pathway: mutations in APC cause FAP and most sporadic cases of CRC
pathogenesis of (commonly left-sided) via adenoma-carcinoma sequence.
colorectal cancer Microsatellite instability pathway: mutations or methylation of mismatch repair genes (eg, MLH1)
cause Lynch syndrome and some sporadic CRC via serrated polyp pathway.

the farthest, followed by HbF, HbS, and HbC.
This is because the missense mutations in HbS

This chapter provides information you will need to understand common
anatomic dysfunctions, orthopedic conditions, rheumatic diseases, and
dermatologic conditions. Be able to interpret 3D anatomy in the context
of radiologic imaging. For the rheumatic diseases, create instructional
cases that include the most likely presentation and symptoms: risk
factors, gender, important markers (eg, autoantibodies), and other
epidemiologic factors. Doing so will allow you to answer higher order
questions that are likely to be asked on the exam.

Cell biology of bone
Osteoblast Builds bone by secreting collagen and catalyzing mineralization in alkaline environment via ALP.
Differentiates from mesenchymal stem cells in periosteum. Osteoblastic activity measured by
bone ALP, osteocalcin, propeptides of type I procollagen.
Osteoclast Dissolves (“crushes”) bone by secreting H+ and collagenases. Differentiates from a fusion of
monocyte/macrophage lineage precursors. RANK receptors on osteoclasts are stimulated by
RANKL (RANK ligand, expressed on osteoblasts). OPG (osteoprotegerin, a RANKL decoy
receptor) binds RANKL to prevent RANK-RANKL interaction   osteoclast activity.
Parathyroid hormone At low, intermittent levels, exerts anabolic effects (building bone) on osteoblasts and osteoclasts
(indirect). Chronically  PTH levels (1° hyperparathyroidism) cause catabolic effects (osteitis
fibrosa cystica).

Scleroderma Systemic sclerosis. Triad of autoimmunity, noninflammatory vasculopathy, and collagen deposition
with fibrosis. Commonly sclerosis of skin, manifesting as puffy, taut skin A without wrinkles,
fingertip pitting B. Can involve other systems, eg, renal (scleroderma renal crisis; treat with ACE
inhibitors), pulmonary (interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary HTN), GI ( peristalsis and LES tone 
dysphagia, heartburn), cardiovascular. 75% female. 2 major types:
 Diffuse scleroderma—widespread skin involvement, rapid progression, early visceral
involvement. Associated with anti-Scl-70 antibody (anti-DNA topoisomerase-I antibody) and
anti-RNA polymerase III.
 Limited scleroderma—limited skin involvement confined to fingers and face. Also with
CREST syndrome: Calcinosis cutis C, anti-Centromere antibody, Raynaud phenomenon,
Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia. More benign clinical course.

Sun exposure strongly predisposes to skin cancer.
Basal cell carcinoma Most common skin cancer. Found in sun-exposed areas of body (eg, face). Locally invasive, but
rarely metastasizes. Waxy, pink, pearly nodules, commonly with telangiectasias, rolled borders A,
central crusting or ulceration. BCCs also appear as a scaling plaque (superficial BCC) B.
Squamous cell Second most common skin cancer. Associated with immunosuppression, chronic nonhealing
carcinoma wounds, and occasionally arsenic exposure. Marjolin ulcer—SCC arising in chronic wounds or
scars; usually develops > 20 years after insult. Commonly appears on face C, lower lip D, ears,
hands. Locally invasive, may spread to lymph nodes, and will rarely metastasize. Ulcerative red
lesions. Histopathology: keratin “pearls” E.
Actinic keratosis—Premalignant lesions caused by sun exposure. Small, rough, erythematous or
brownish papules or plaques F. Risk of squamous cell carcinoma is proportional to degree of
epithelial dysplasia.
Melanoma Common tumor with significant risk of metastasis. S-100 tumor marker. Associated with dysplastic
nevi; people with lighter skin tones are at  risk. Depth of tumor (Breslow thickness) correlates
with risk of metastasis. Look for the ABCDEs: Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation,
Diameter > 6 mm, and Evolution over time. At least 4 different types of melanoma, including
superficial spreading G, nodular H, lentigo maligna I , and acral lentiginous (highest prevalence
in people with darker skin tones) J. Often driven by activating mutation in BRAF kinase.
Primary treatment is excision with appropriately wide margins. Advanced melanoma also treated
with immunotherapy (eg, ipilimumab) and/or BRAF inhibitors (eg, vemurafenib).

Ischemic brain Irreversible neuronal injury begins after 5 minutes of hypoxia. Most vulnerable: hippocampus
disease/stroke (CA1 region), neocortex, cerebellum (Purkinje cells), watershed areas (“vulnerable hippos need

Stroke imaging: noncontrast CT to exclude hemorrhage (before tPA can be given). CT detects
ischemic changes in 6–24 hr. Diffusion-weighted MRI can detect ischemia within 3–30 min.

Ischemic stroke Ischemia  infarction  liquefactive necrosis.
3 types:
A
 Thrombotic—due to a clot forming directly at site of infarction (commonly the MCA A),
usually over a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque.
 Embolic—due to an embolus from another part of the body. Can affect multiple vascular
territories. Examples: atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis, DVT with patent foramen ovale
(paradoxical embolism), infective endocarditis.
 Hypoxic—due to systemic hypoperfusion or hypoxemia. Common during cardiovascular
surgeries, tends to affect watershed areas.
Treatment: tPA (if within 3–4.5 hr of onset and no hemorrhage/risk of hemorrhage) and/or
thrombectomy (if large artery occlusion). Reduce risk with medical therapy (eg, aspirin,
clopidogrel); optimum control of blood pressure, blood sugars, lipids; smoking cessation; and treat
conditions that  risk (eg, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery stenosis).
Transient ischemic Brief, reversible episode of focal neurologic dysfunction without acute infarction (⊝ MRI), with the
attack majority resolving in < 15 minutes; ischemia (eg, embolus, small vessel stenosis). May present with
amaurosis fugax (transient visual loss) due to retinal artery emboli from carotid artery disease.
Cerebral edema Fluid accumulation in brain parenchyma   ICP. Types:
A  Cytotoxic edema—intracellular fluid accumulation due to osmotic shift (eg, Na+/K+-ATPase
dysfunction   intracellular Na+). Caused by ischemia (early), hyperammonemia, SIADH.
 Vasogenic edema—extracellular fluid accumulation due to disruption of BBB ( permeability).
Caused by ischemia (late), trauma, hemorrhage, inflammation, tumors (arrows in A show
surrounding vasogenic edema).

Other demyelinating and dysmyelinating disorders
Osmotic demyelination Also called central pontine myelinolysis. Massive axonal demyelination in pontine white matter
syndrome A 2° to rapid osmotic changes, most commonly iatrogenic correction of hyponatremia but also
A rapid shifts of other osmolytes (eg, glucose). Acute paralysis, dysarthria, dysphagia, diplopia, loss of
consciousness. Can cause “locked-in syndrome.”
Correcting serum Na+ too fast:
 “From low to high, your pons will die” (osmotic demyelination syndrome)
 “From high to low, your brains will blow” (cerebral edema/herniation)
Acute inflammatory Most common subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
demyelinating Autoimmune condition that destroys Schwann cells via inflammation and demyelination of motor
polyneuropathy fibers, sensory fibers, peripheral nerves (including CN III-XII). Likely facilitated by molecular
mimicry and triggered by inoculations or stress. Despite association with infections (eg,
Campylobacter jejuni, viruses [eg, Zika]), no definitive causal link to any pathogen.
Results in symmetric ascending muscle weakness/paralysis and depressed/absent DTRs beginning
in lower extremities. Facial paralysis (usually bilateral) and respiratory failure are common. May
see autonomic dysregulation (eg, cardiac irregularities, hypertension, hypotension) or sensory
abnormalities. Most patients survive with good functional recovery.
 CSF protein with normal cell count (albuminocytologic dissociation).
Respiratory support is critical until recovery. Disease-modifying treatment: plasma exchange or
IV immunoglobulins. No role for steroids.
Acute disseminated Multifocal inflammation and demyelination after infection or vaccination. Presents with rapidly
(postinfectious) progressive multifocal neurologic symptoms, altered mental status.
encephalomyelitis
Charcot-Marie-Tooth Also called hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy. Group of progressive hereditary nerve
disease disorders related to the defective production of proteins involved in the structure and function of
peripheral nerves or the myelin sheath. Typically autosomal dominant and associated with foot
deformities (eg, pes cavus, hammer toe), lower extremity weakness (eg, foot drop), and sensory
deficits (Can’t Move Toes). Most common type, CMT1A, is caused by PMP22 gene duplication.
Progressive multifocal Demyelination of CNS B due to destruction of oligodendrocytes (2° to reactivation of latent JC
leukoencephalopathy virus infection). Associated with severe immunosuppression (eg, lymphomas and leukemias,
B AIDS, organ transplantation). Rapidly progressive, usually fatal. Predominantly involves parietal
and occipital areas; visual symptoms are common.  risk associated with natalizumab.
Other disorders Krabbe disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy.

Auditory anatomy and
physiology
Outer ear Visible portion of ear (pinna), includes auditory canal and tympanic membrane. Transfers sound
waves via vibration of tympanic membrane.
Middle ear Air-filled space with three bones called the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes). Ossicles conduct and
amplify sound from tympanic membrane to inner ear.
Inner ear Snail-shaped, fluid-filled cochlea. Contains basilar membrane that vibrates 2° to sound waves.
Vibration transduced via specialized hair cells  auditory nerve signaling  brainstem.
Each frequency leads to vibration at specific location on basilar membrane (tonotopy):
 Low frequency heard at apex near helicotrema (wide and flexible).
 High frequency heard best at base of cochlea (thin and rigid).
Otitis externa Inflammation of external auditory canal. Most commonly due to Pseudomonas. Associated with

Presents with otalgia that worsens with ear manipulation, pruritus, hearing loss, discharge A.
Malignant (necrotizing) otitis externa—invasive infection causing osteomyelitis. Complication
of otitis externa mostly seen in older patients with diabetes. Presents with severe otalgia and
otorrhea. May lead to cranial nerve palsies. Physical exam shows granulation tissue in ear canal.
Otitis media Inflammation of middle ear. Most commonly due to nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae,
A Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis. Associated with eustachian tube dysfunction,
which promotes overgrowth of bacterial colonizers of upper respiratory tract.
Usually seen in children < 2 years old. Presents with fever, otalgia, hearing loss. Physical exam
shows bulging, erythematous tympanic membrane A that may rupture.
Mastoiditis—infection of mastoid process of temporal bone. Complication of acute otitis media
due to continuity of middle ear cavity with mastoid air cells. Presents with postauricular pain,
erythema, swelling. May lead to brain abscess.

Glaucoma Optic neuropathy causing progressive vision loss (peripheral  central). Usually, but not always,
accompanied by  intraocular pressure (IOP). Etiology is most often 1°, but can be 2° to an
identifiable cause (eg, uveitis, glucocorticoids). Funduscopy: optic disc cupping (normal A vs
thinning of outer rim of optic disc B). Treatment: pharmacologic or surgical lowering of IOP.
Open-angle glaucoma Anterior chamber angle is open (normal). Most common type in US. Associated with  resistance
to aqueous humor drainage through trabecular meshwork. Risk factors:  age, race ( incidence
in Black population), family history, diabetes mellitus. Typically asymptomatic and discovered
incidentally.
Angle-closure Anterior chamber angle is narrowed or closed. Associated with anatomic abnormalities (eg,
glaucoma anteriorly displaced lens resting against central iris)   aqueous flow through pupil (pupillary
block)  pressure buildup in posterior chamber  peripheral iris pushed against cornea 
obstruction of drainage pathways by the iris. Usually chronic and asymptomatic, but may develop
acutely.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma—complete pupillary block causing abrupt angle closure and rapid
 IOP. Presents with severe eye pain, conjunctival erythema C, sudden vision loss, halos around
lights, headache, fixed and mid-dilated pupil, nausea and vomiting. Hurts in a hurry with halos,
a headache, and a “half-dilated” pupil. True ophthalmic emergency that requires immediate
management to prevent blindness. Mydriatic agents are contraindicated.

Retinal disorders
Age-related macular Degeneration of macula (central area of retina)  loss of central vision (scotomas). Two types:
degeneration  Dry (most common)—gradual  in vision with subretinal deposits (drusen, arrow in A).
 Wet—rapid  in vision due to bleeding 2° to choroidal neovascularization. Distortion of straight
lines (metamorphopsia) is an early symptom.
Diabetic retinopathy Chronic hyperglycemia   permeability and occlusion of retinal vessels. Two types:
 Nonproliferative (most common)—microaneurysms, hemorrhages (arrows in B), cotton-wool
spots, hard exudates. Vision loss mainly due to macular edema.
 Proliferative—retinal neovascularization due to chronic hypoxia. Abnormal new vessels may
cause vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment.
Hypertensive Chronic hypertension  spasm, sclerosis, and fibrinoid necrosis of retinal vessels. Funduscopy:
retinopathy arteriovenous nicking, microaneurysms, hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots (blue arrow in C), hard
exudates (may form macular “star,” red arrow in C). Presence of papilledema is indicative of
hypertensive emergency and warrants immediate lowering of blood pressure.
Retinal artery Blockage of central or branch retinal artery usually due to embolism (carotid artery atherosclerosis
occlusion > cardiogenic); less commonly due to giant cell arteritis. Presents with acute, painless monocular
vision loss. Funduscopy: cloudy retina with “cherry-red” spot at fovea D, identifiable retinal
emboli (eg, cholesterol crystals appear as small, yellow, refractile deposits in arterioles).
Retinal vein occlusion Central retinal vein occlusion is due to 1° thrombosis; branch retinal vein occlusion is due to 2°
thrombosis at arteriovenous crossings (sclerotic arteriole compresses adjacent venule causing
turbulent blood flow). Funduscopy: retinal hemorrhage and venous engorgement (“blood and
thunder” appearance; arrows in E), retinal edema in affected areas.
Retinal detachment Separation of neurosensory retina from underlying retinal pigment epithelium  loss of choroidal
blood supply  hypoxia and degeneration of photoreceptors. Two types:
 Rhegmatogenous (most common)—due to retinal tears; often associated with posterior vitreous
detachment ( risk with advanced age, high myopia), less frequently traumatic.
 Nonrhegmatogenous—tractional or exudative (fluid accumulation).
Commonly presents with symptoms of posterior vitreous detachment (eg, floaters, light flashes)
followed by painless monocular vision loss (“dark curtain”). Funduscopy: opacification and
wrinkling of detached retina F, change in vessel direction. Surgical emergency.
Retinitis pigmentosa Group of inherited dystrophies causing progressive degeneration of photoreceptors and retinal
pigment epithelium. May be associated with abetalipoproteinemia. Early symptoms: night
blindness (nyctalopia) and peripheral vision loss. Funduscopy: triad of optic disc pallor, retinal
vessel attenuation, and retinal pigmentation with bone spicule-shaped deposits G.
Retinopathy of Preterm birth  loss of normal hypoxic environment in utero  relative hyperoxia ( with
prematurity supplemental O for NRDS)   VEGF  arrest of normal retinal vascularization. As the

eyes grow  hypoxia of avascular retina   VEGF  retinal neovascularization (may cause
tractional retinal detachment). Common cause of childhood blindness.
Papilledema Optic disc swelling (usually bilateral) due to  ICP (eg, 2° to mass effect). Results from impaired
axoplasmic flow in optic nerve. Funduscopy: elevated optic disc with blurred margins H.

(minor retractors) and sweat glands of forehead and face.
Long ciliary nerves make the pupil diameter longer.
Relative afferent Also called Marcus Gunn pupil. Extent of pupillary constriction differs when light is shone in one
pupillary defect eye at a time due to unilateral or asymmetric lesions of afferent limb of pupillary reflex (eg, retina,
optic nerve). When light shines into a normal eye, constriction of the ipsilateral eye (direct reflex)
and contralateral eye (consensual reflex) is observed. When light is swung from a normal eye to an
affected eye, both pupils dilate instead of constricting.

for each individual, are specific to each loss, and do not follow a fixed series of stages. In addition
to guilt, sadness, and yearning, patients may experience somatic symptoms, hallucinations of the
deceased, and/or transient episodes of wishing they had died with or instead of their loved one.
Typical acute grief is time limited (adaptations within 6 months) and is not a disorder.
Prolonged grief disorder—diagnosed if grief remains intense, persistent, and prolonged (at least

Psychosis Distorted perception of reality characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and/or disorganized
thought/speech. Can occur in patients with psychiatric illness or another medical condition, or
secondary to substance or medication use.
Delusions False, fixed, idiosyncratic beliefs that persist despite evidence to the contrary and are not typical
of a patient’s culture or religion (eg, a patient who believes that others are reading his thoughts).
Types include erotomanic, grandiose, jealous, persecutory, somatic, mixed, and unspecified.
Disorganized thought Speech may be incoherent (“word salad”), tangential, or derailed (“loose associations”).
Hallucinations Perceptions in the absence of external stimuli (eg, seeing a light that is not actually present).
Contrast with misperceptions (eg, illusions) of real external stimuli. Types include:
 Auditory—more commonly due to psychiatric illness (eg, schizophrenia) than neurologic
disease.
 Visual—more commonly due to neurologic disease (eg, dementia), delirium, or drug
intoxication than psychiatric illness.
 Tactile—common in alcohol withdrawal and stimulant use (eg, “cocaine crawlies,” a type of
delusional parasitosis).
 Olfactory—often occur as an aura of temporal lobe epilepsy (eg, burning rubber) and in brain
tumors.
 Gustatory—rare, but seen in epilepsy.
 Hypnagogic—occurs while going to sleep. Sometimes seen in narcolepsy.
 Hypnopompic—occurs while waking from sleep (“get pomped up in the morning”).
Sometimes seen in narcolepsy.
Contrast with illusions, which are misperceptions of real external stimuli (eg, mistaking a shadow
for a black cat).
Mood disorder Characterized by an abnormal range of moods or internal emotional states and loss of control over
them. Severity of moods causes distress and impairment in social and occupational functioning.
Includes major depressive, bipolar, dysthymic, and cyclothymic disorders. Episodic superimposed

Hypomanic episode Similar to a manic episode except mood disturbance is not severe enough to cause marked
impairment in social and/or occupational functioning or to necessitate hospitalization.
Abnormally  activity or energy usually present. No psychotic features. Lasts ≥ 4 consecutive days.
Bipolar disorder Bipolar I (requires 1 type of episode)—≥ 1 manic episode +/− a hypomanic or depressive episode
(may be separated by any length of time).
Bipolar II (requires 2 types of episodes)—a hypomanic and a depressive episode (no history of
manic episodes).
Patient’s mood and functioning usually normalize between episodes. Use of antidepressants can
destabilize mood. High suicide risk. Treatment: atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers (eg,
lithium, lamotrigine, valproate, carbamazepine). A little less variable character.
Cyclothymic disorder—milder form of bipolar disorder fluctuating between mild depressive and
hypomanic symptoms. Must last ≥ 2 years with symptoms present at least half of the time, with
any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.
Major depressive Recurrent episodes lasting ≥ 2 weeks characterized by ≥ 5 of 9 diagnostic symptoms including

 Guilt or feelings of worthlessness
  Energy
  Concentration
 Appetite/weight changes
 Psychomotor retardation or agitation
 Suicidal ideation
Screen for previous manic or hypomanic episodes to rule out bipolar disorder.
Treatment: CBT and SSRIs are first line; alternatives include SNRIs, mirtazapine, bupropion,
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), ketamine.
Responses to a significant loss (eg, bereavement, natural disaster, disability) may resemble a
depressive episode. Diagnosis of MDD is made if criteria are met.
MDD with psychotic MDD + hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic features are typically mood congruent (eg,
features depressive themes of inadequacy, guilt, punishment, nihilism, disease, or death) and occur only
in the context of major depressive episode (vs schizoaffective disorder). Treatment: antidepressant
with atypical antipsychotic, ECT.
Persistent depressive Also called dysthymia. Often milder than MDD; ≥ 2 depressive symptoms lasting ≥ 2 years (≥ 1
disorder year in children), with any remission lasting ≤ 2 months.
MDD with seasonal Formerly called seasonal affective disorder. Major depressive episodes occurring only during a
pattern particular season (usually winter) in ≥ 2 consecutive years and in most years across a lifetime.
Atypical symptoms common. Treatment: standard MDD therapies + light therapy.
Depression with Characterized by mood reactivity (transient improvement in response to a positive event),
atypical features hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis (heavy feeling in arms and legs), long-standing
interpersonal rejection sensitivity. Most common subtype of depression. Treatment: CBT and
SSRIs are first line. MAO inhibitors are effective but not first line because of their risk profile.

Personality disorders Inflexible, maladaptive, and rigidly pervasive patterns of behavior causing subjective distress and/
or impaired functioning; person is usually not aware of problem (egosyntonic). Usually present
by early adulthood. Contrast with personality traits—nonpathologic enduring patterns of
perception and behavior.
Three clusters:
 Cluster A (remember as “weird”)—odd or eccentric; inability to develop meaningful social
relationships. No psychosis; genetic association with schizophrenia.
 Cluster B (remember as “wild”)—dramatic, emotional, or erratic; genetic association with mood
disorders and substance use.
 Cluster C (remember as “worried”)—anxious or fearful; genetic association with anxiety
disorders.
Cluster A
Paranoid Pervasive distrust (accusatory), suspiciousness, hypervigilance, and a profoundly cynical view of the
world.
Schizoid Prefers social withdrawal and solitary activities (vs avoidant), limited emotional expression,
indifferent to others’ opinions (aloof).
Schizotypal Eccentric appearance, odd beliefs or magical thinking, interpersonal awkwardness. Included on
the schizophrenia spectrum. Pronounce “schizo-type-al” for odd-type thoughts.
Cluster B
Antisocial Disregard for the rights of others with lack of remorse (bad). Involves criminality, impulsivity,
hostility, and manipulation (sociopath). Males > females. Must be ≥ 18 years old with evidence of
conduct disorder onset before age 15. If patient is < 18, diagnosis is conduct disorder.
Borderline Unstable mood and interpersonal relationships, fear of abandonment, impulsivity, self-mutilation,
suicidality, sense of emotional emptiness (borderline). Females > males. Splitting is a major
defense mechanism. Treatment: dialectical behavior therapy.
Histrionic Attention-seeking, dramatic speech and emotional expression, shallow and labile emotions,
sexually provocative. May use physical appearance to draw attention (flamboyant).
Narcissistic Grandiosity, sense of entitlement; lacks empathy and requires excessive admiration; often demands
the “best” and reacts to criticism with rage and/or defensiveness (must be the best). Fragile self-
esteem. Often envious of others.
Cluster C
Avoidant Hypersensitive to rejection and criticism, socially inhibited, timid (cowardly), feelings of
inadequacy, desires relationships with others (vs schizoid).
Obsessive-compulsive Preoccupation with order, perfectionism, and control (obsessive-compulsive); egosyntonic: behavior
consistent with one’s own beliefs and attitudes (vs OCD).
Dependent Excessive need for support (clingy), submissive, low self-confidence. Patients often get stuck in
abusive relationships.

Malingering Symptoms are intentional, motivation is intentional. Patient consciously fakes, profoundly
exaggerates, or claims to have a disorder in order to attain a specific 2° (external) gain (eg,
avoiding work, obtaining compensation). Poor compliance with treatment or follow-up of
diagnostic tests. Complaints cease after gain (vs factitious disorder).
Factitious disorders Symptoms are intentional, motivation is unconscious. Patient consciously creates physical and/or
psychological symptoms in order to assume “sick role” and to get medical attention and sympathy
(1° [internal] gain).
Factitious disorder Formerly called Munchausen syndrome. Chronic factitious disorder with predominantly physical
imposed on self signs and symptoms. Characterized by a history of multiple hospital admissions and willingness to
undergo invasive procedures. More common in females and healthcare workers.
Factitious disorder Formerly called Munchausen syndrome by proxy. Illness in an individual being cared for (most
imposed on another often a child, also seen in disabled or older adults) is directly caused (eg, physically harming a
child) or fabricated (eg, lying about a child’s symptoms) by the caregiver. Form of child/elder
abuse.
Somatic symptom and Symptoms are unconscious, motivation is unconscious. Category of disorders characterized by
related disorders physical symptoms causing significant distress and impairment. Symptoms not intentionally
produced or feigned.
Somatic symptom ≥ 1 bodily complaints (eg, abdominal pain, fatigue) lasting months to years. Associated with excessive,
disorder persistent thoughts and anxiety about symptoms. May co-occur with medical illness. Treatment:
regular office visits with the same physician with the goals of addressing active symptoms, reassuring
the patient, and avoiding unnecessary tests or medications.
Conversion disorder Also called functional neurologic symptom disorder. Unexplained loss of sensory or motor function
(eg, paralysis, blindness, mutism), often following an acute stressor; patient may be aware of but
indifferent toward symptoms (“la belle indifférence”); more common in females, adolescents, and
young adults.
Illness anxiety Preoccupation with acquiring or having a serious illness, often despite medical evaluation and
disorder reassurance; minimal to no somatic symptoms.

Eating disorders Most common in young women.
Anorexia nervosa Intense fear of weight gain, overvaluation of thinness, and body image distortion leading to calorie
restriction and severe weight loss resulting in inappropriately low body weight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2
for adults). Physiological disturbances may present as bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia,
hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, lanugo, amenorrhea (low calorie intake   leptin   GnRH
  LH, FSH   estrogen  amenorrhea).
Binge-eating/purging type—recurring purging behaviors (eg, laxative or diuretic abuse, self-
induced vomiting) or binge eating over the last 3 months. Associated with hypokalemia.
Restricting type—primary disordered behaviors include dieting, fasting, and/or over-exercising. No
recurring purging behaviors or binge eating over the last 3 months.

3 months.  diabetes risk. Most common eating disorder in adults.
Treatment: psychotherapy (first line); SSRIs; lisdexamfetamine.
Pica Recurring episodes of eating non-food substances (eg, ice, dirt, hair, paint chips) over ≥ 1 month
that are not culturally or developmentally recognized as normal. May provide temporary
emotional relief. Common in children and during pregnancy. Associated with malnutrition, iron
deficiency anemia, developmental disabilities, emotional trauma.
Treatment: psychotherapy and nutritional rehabilitation (first line); SSRIs (second line).
Gender dysphoria Significant incongruence between one’s gender identity and one’s gender assigned at birth, lasting
> 6 months and leading to persistent distress. Individuals experience marked discomfort with their
assigned gender, which interferes with social, academic, and other areas of function. Individuals
may pursue multiple domains of gender affirmation, including social, legal, and medical.
Transgender—any individual who transiently or persistently experiences incongruence between
their gender identity and their gender assigned at birth. Some individuals who are transgender
will experience gender dysphoria. Nonconformity to one’s assigned gender itself is not a mental
disorder.
Sexual dysfunction Includes sexual desire disorders (hypoactive sexual desire or sexual aversion), sexual arousal
disorders (erectile dysfunction), orgasmic disorders (anorgasmia, premature ejaculation), sexual
pain disorders (genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder).
Differential diagnosis includes (PENIS):
 Psychological (if nighttime erections still occur)
 Endocrine (eg, diabetes, low testosterone)
 Neurogenic (eg, postoperative, spinal cord injury)
 Insufficient blood flow (eg, atherosclerosis)
 Substances (eg, antihypertensives, antidepressants, ethanol)

Sleep terror disorder Periods of inconsolable terror with screaming in the middle of the night. Most common in
children. Occurs during slow-wave/deep (stage N3) non-REM sleep with no memory of the
arousal episode, as opposed to nightmares that occur during REM sleep (remembering a scary
dream). Triggers include emotional stress, fever, and lack of sleep. Usually self limited.
Enuresis Nighttime urinary incontinence ≥ 2 times/week for ≥ 3 months in person > 5 years old. First-line
treatment: behavioral modification (eg, scheduled voids, nighttime fluid restriction) and positive
reinforcement. For refractory cases: bedwetting alarm, oral desmopressin (ADH analog; preferred
over imipramine due to fewer adverse effects).
Narcolepsy Excessive daytime sleepiness (despite awakening well-rested) with recurrent episodes of rapid-onset,
overwhelming sleepiness ≥ 3 times/week for the last 3 months. Due to  orexin (hypocretin)
production in lateral hypothalamus and dysregulated sleep-wake cycles. Associated with:
 Hypnagogic (just before going to sleep) or hypnopompic (just before awakening; get pomped
up in the morning) hallucinations.
 Nocturnal and narcoleptic sleep episodes that start with REM sleep (sleep paralysis).
 Cataplexy (loss of all muscle tone following strong emotional stimulus, such as laughter).
Treatment: good sleep hygiene (scheduled naps, regular sleep schedule), daytime stimulants (eg,
amphetamines, modafinil) and/or nighttime sodium oxybate (GHB).
Substance use Maladaptive pattern of substance use involving ≥ 2 of the following in the past year:
disorder  Tolerance
 Withdrawal
 Intense, distracting cravings
 Using more, or longer, than intended
 Persistent desire but inability to cut down
 Time-consuming substance acquisition, use, or recovery
 Impaired functioning at work, school, or home
 Social or interpersonal conflicts
 Reduced recreational activities
 > 1 episode of use involving danger (eg, unsafe sex, driving while impaired)
 Continued use despite awareness of harm
In the case of appropriate medical treatment with prescribed medications (eg, opioid analgesics,
sedatives, stimulants), symptoms of tolerance and withdrawal do not indicate a substance use disorder.
Gambling disorder Persistent, recurrent, problematic gambling that cannot be better explained as a manic episode.
Diagnosis made if patient meets ≥ 4 of the following criteria:
 Is preoccupied with gambling
 Requires more gambling to reach desired level of excitement
 Has failed efforts to limit, cut back, or stop gambling
 Becomes restless or irritable when limiting or attempting to stop gambling
 Gambles to escape or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression
 After losing money gambling, continues gambling in an attempt to recover losses
 Lies to conceal the extent of gambling
 Puts at risk or has lost significant relationship, career, or academic pursuits because of gambling
 Relies on money from others to fix financial collapse due to gambling
Treatment: psychotherapy.

ACE Catalyzes conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Located in many tissues but conversion
occurs most extensively in the lung. Produced by vascular endothelial cells in the lung.
AT II Helps maintain blood volume and blood pressure. Affects baroreceptor function; limits reflex
bradycardia, which would normally accompany its pressor effects.

muscle via cGMP   GFR;  renin  angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition. Dilates afferent
arteriole, promotes natriuresis.
ADH (vasopressin) Primarily regulates serum osmolality; also responds to low blood volume states. Stimulates
reabsorption of water in collecting ducts. Also stimulates reabsorption of urea in medullary
collecting ducts to maximize corticopapillary osmotic gradient.
Aldosterone Primarily regulates ECF volume and Na+ content;  release in hypovolemic states. Responds to
hyperkalemia by  K+ excretion.

Organizing the reproductive system by key concepts such as embryology,
endocrinology, pregnancy, and oncology can help with understanding
this complex topic. Study the endocrine and reproductive chapters
together, because mastery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis
is key to answering questions on ovulation, menstruation, disorders of
sexual development, contraception, and many pathologies.
Embryology is a nuanced subject that spans multiple organ systems.
Approach it from a clinical perspective. For instance, make the
connection between the presentation of DiGeorge syndrome and the
3rd/4th pharyngeal pouch, and between the Müllerian/Wolffian systems
and disorders of sexual development.
As for oncology, don’t worry about remembering screening or treatment
guidelines. It is more important to recognize the clinical presentation
(eg, signs and symptoms) of reproductive cancers and their associated
labs, histopathology, and risk factors. In addition, some of the testicular
and ovarian cancers have distinct patterns of hCG, AFP, LH, or FSH
derangements that serve as helpful clues in exam questions.

watery cytoplasm and “fried egg” appearance on histology,  placental alkaline phosphatase
(PLAP). Highly radiosensitive. Late metastasis, excellent prognosis.
Embryonal carcinoma Malignant. Painful, hemorrhagic mass with necrosis. Often glandular/papillary morphology.
“Pure” embryonal carcinoma is rare; most commonly mixed with other tumor types. May present

At FRC, airway and alveolar pressures equal
atmospheric pressure (PB; called zero), and

balanced by the outward pull of the chest wall.

Pulmonary emboli Obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by foreign material (usually thrombus) that
originated elsewhere. Affected alveoli are ventilated but not perfused ( mismatch). May present
with sudden-onset dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypoxemia, respiratory
alkalosis. Large emboli or saddle embolus (red arrows show filling defects in A) may cause sudden
death due to clot preventing blood from filling LV and increased RV size further compromising
LV filling (obstructive shock). CT pulmonary angiography is imaging test of choice for PE (look for
filling defects) B. ECG may show sinus tachycardia or, less commonly, S1Q3T3 abnormality.
Lines of Zahn C are interdigitating areas of pink (platelets, fibrin) and red (RBCs) found only in
thrombi formed before death; help distinguish pre- and postmortem thrombi.
Treatment: anticoagulation (eg, heparin, direct thrombin/factor Xa inhibitors), IVC filter (if
anticoagulation is contraindicated).
Types: Fat, Air, Thrombus, Bacteria, Amniotic fluid, Tumor. An embolus moves like a FAT BAT.
Fat emboli—associated with long bone fractures and liposuction; classic triad of hypoxemia,
neurologic abnormalities, petechial rash.
Air emboli—nitrogen bubbles precipitate in ascending divers (caisson disease/decompression sickness);

Mediastinal pathology Normal mediastinum contains heart, thymus, lymph nodes, esophagus, and aorta.
Mediastinal masses Some pathologies (eg, lymphoma, lung cancer, abscess) can occur in any compartment, but there
are common associations:
 Anterior—4 T’s: thyroid (substernal goiter), thymic neoplasm, teratoma, “terrible” lymphoma.
 Middle—metastases, hiatal hernia, bronchogenic cysts.
 Posterior—esophageal cancer (may present as mass in, or spread to, middle mediastinum),
neurogenic tumor (eg, neurofibroma), multiple myeloma.
Mediastinitis Inflammation of mediastinal tissues. Commonly due to postoperative complications of
cardiothoracic procedures (≤ 14 days), esophageal perforation, or contiguous spread of
odontogenic/retropharyngeal infection.
Chronic mediastinitis—also called fibrosing mediastinitis; due to  proliferation of connective
tissue in mediastinum. Histoplasma capsulatum is common cause.
Clinical features: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis, chest pain, and sternal wound drainage.
Pneumomediastinum Presence of gas (usually air) in the mediastinum. Can either be spontaneous (due to rupture of
pulmonary bleb) or 2° (eg, trauma, iatrogenic, Boerhaave syndrome).
Ruptured alveoli allow tracking of air into the mediastinum via peribronchial and perivascular sheaths.
Clinical features: chest pain, dyspnea, voice change, subcutaneous emphysema, ⊕ Hamman sign
(crepitus on cardiac auscultation).

Asthma drugs Bronchoconstriction is mediated by (1) inflammatory processes and (2) parasympathetic tone;
therapy is directed at these 2 pathways.
Inhaled ββ-agonists Albuterol, salmeterol, formoterol—relax bronchial smooth muscle. Can cause tremor,
2
arrhythmia. Albuterol is short-acting, used for acute symptoms. Salmeterol and formoterol are
long-acting.
Inhaled or oral Fluticasone, budesonide—inhibit the synthesis of virtually all cytokines. Inactivate NF-κB, the
glucocorticoids transcription factor that induces production of TNF-α and other inflammatory agents. 1st-line
therapy for chronic asthma. Use a spacer or rinse mouth after use to prevent oral thrush.
Muscarinic Tiotropium, ipratropium—competitively block muscarinic receptors, preventing
antagonists bronchoconstriction. Also used for COPD. Tiotropium is long acting.
Antileukotrienes Montelukast, zafirlukast—block leukotriene receptors (CysLT1). Especially good for aspirin-
induced and exercise-induced asthma.
Zileuton—5-lipoxygenase inhibitor.  conversion of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes. Hepatotoxic.
Anti-IgE monoclonal Omalizumab—binds mostly unbound serum IgE and blocks binding to FcεRI. Used in allergic
therapy asthma with  IgE levels resistant to inhaled glucocorticoids and long-acting β-agonists.

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE
This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample
examination books, websites, apps, and commercial review courses that have
been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For
each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First
Author (or editor), the Series Name, the Current Publisher, the Copyright
Year, the Number of Pages, the ISBN, the Approximate List Price,
the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. We also
include Summary Comments that describe their style and overall utility for
studying. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within
each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically
by the first author within each Rating group.
A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student
evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as
follows:
A+ Excellent for boards review.
A
Very good for boards review; choose among the group.
A−
B+
Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.
B
Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low-
B−
yield subject material.
The rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in
helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a
number of factors, including:
 The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1
 The appropriateness and accuracy of the material
 The readability of the text, where applicable
 The quality and number of sample questions
 The quality of written answers to sample questions
 The cost
 The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and
mobile apps
 The quality and appropriateness of the images and illustrations
 The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)
 The quality and number of other resources available in the same
discipline
Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for
purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with
lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards

preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks
available for the basic sciences.
Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal
surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the
country. The summary comments and overall ratings represent a consensus
opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited
student feedback on any particular resource.
Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that:
 Publisher and app store prices change frequently.
 Retail and online bookstores may set their own prices.
 New editions and app versions come out frequently, and the quality of
updating varies.
 The same book may be reissued through another publisher.
We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions
and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update
our database. In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for
evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new
editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews
of new books, mobile apps, websites, flash cards, and commercial review
courses.
Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement
None of the ratings reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All
errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention
of the authors through our blog at firstaidteam.com. Please note that
USMLE-Rx, ScholarRx, and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series
are publications by certain authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1; the
following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student
authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 as well as data from the student
survey and feedback forms.

` HOW TO USE THE DATABASE
This section is a database of top-rated basic science review books, sample
examination books, websites, apps, and commercial review courses that have
been marketed to medical students studying for the USMLE Step 1. For
each recommended resource, we list (where applicable) the Title, the First
Author (or editor), the Series Name, the Current Publisher, the Copyright
Year, the Number of Pages, the ISBN, the Approximate List Price,
the Format of the resource, and the Number of Test Questions. We also
include Summary Comments that describe their style and overall utility for
studying. Finally, each recommended resource receives a Rating. Within
each section, resources are arranged first by Rating and then alphabetically
by the first author within each Rating group.
A letter rating scale with six different grades reflects the detailed student
evaluations for Rated Resources. Each rated resource receives a rating as
follows:
A+ Excellent for boards review.
A
Very good for boards review; choose among the group.
A−
B+
Good, but use only after exhausting better resources.
B
Fair, but there are many better resources in the discipline; or low-
B−
yield subject material.
The rating is meant to reflect the overall usefulness of the resource in
helping medical students prepare for the USMLE Step 1. This is based on a
number of factors, including
 The importance of the discipline for the USMLE Step 1
 The appropriateness and accuracy of the material
 The readability of the text, where applicable
 The quality and number of sample questions
 The quality of written answers to sample questions
 The cost
 The quality of the user interface and learning experience, for web and
mobile apps
 The quality and appropriateness of the images and illustrations
 The length of the text (longer is not necessarily better)
 The quality and number of other resources available in the same
discipline
Please note that ratings do not reflect the quality of the resources for
purposes other than reviewing for the USMLE Step 1. Many books with
lower ratings are well written and informative but are not ideal for boards

preparation. We have not listed or commented on general textbooks
available for the basic sciences.
Evaluations are based on the cumulative results of formal and informal
surveys of thousands of medical students at many medical schools across the
country. The summary comments and overall ratings represent a consensus
opinion, but there may have been a broad range of opinion or limited
student feedback on any particular resource.
Please note that the data listed are subject to change in that
 Publisher and app store prices change frequently.
 Retail and online bookstores may set their own prices.
 New editions and app versions come out frequently, and the quality of
updating varies.
 The same book may be reissued through another publisher.
We actively encourage medical students and faculty to submit their opinions
and ratings of these basic science review materials so that we may update
our database. In addition, we ask that publishers and authors submit for
evaluation review copies of basic science review books, including new
editions and books not included in our database. We also solicit reviews
of new books, mobile apps, websites, flash cards, and commercial review
courses.
Disclaimer/Conflict of Interest Statement
None of the ratings reflects the opinion or influence of the publisher. All
errors and omissions will gladly be corrected if brought to the attention
of the authors through our blog at firstaidteam.com. Please note that
USMLE-Rx, ScholarRx, and the entire First Aid for the USMLE series
are publications by certain authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1; the
following ratings are based solely on recommendations from the student
authors of First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 as well as data from a far-
reaching, detailed survey we distribute to thousands of medical students
every year.

with performance on the actual exam. The postexam reviews now provide explanations for the answers
as well. Students use these as rough gauges of score progression over their study period. Additional fea-
ture includes an in-person practice session at Prometric (price: $148) for students who wish to practice
the logistics of exam day.
A– USMLE-Rx Qmax $129-$349 Test/2750+ q

Offers Step 1–style questions accompanied by thorough explanations. Omits obscure material and dis-
tills high-yield information. Best used after a first readthrough of First Aid. Each explanation includes
references from First Aid. However, the proportion of questions covering a given subject may not reflect
the actual exam’s relative emphasis. Also, content is similar to First Aid, but some questions will test
additional concepts required to grasp core concepts. Question stems avoid “buzzwords” and explana-
tions provide in-depth answers and concepts. Most useful to help commit First Aid to memory. Provides
detailed performance analyses. Free trial available, accessible through iOS and Android mobile apps.

LiLLy
Lippincott Williams & Williams, 2020, 480 pages, ISBN 9781975120597
Great resource that outlines an in-depth explanation of both cardiac physiology and pathology. Best
used as a supplement when learning the material for the first time, as it helps build a strong founda-
tion. Because the book itself is rather dense, it is not recommend as a primary resource during focused
boards studying period.

Ridiculously Simple
prestOn
MedMaster, 2017, 166 pages, ISBN 9781935660293
A resource that covers major acid-base and renal physiology concepts. Provides information beyond
the scope of Step 1, but remains a useful companion for studying kidney function, electrolyte distur-
bances, and fluid management. Includes scattered diagrams and questions at the end of each chapter.
Consider using after exhausting more high-yield physiology review resources.

Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2018, 544 pages, ISBN 9781496385826
A good textbook for understanding key concepts in physiology. Similar in content to other leading
books, but with more compact presentation style and a lot of extra details. May have information in
excess to what is needed for Step 1. Excellent illustrations. Ideal as a supplement material, or as course-
work during first year of medical school.
B BRS Physiology $58 Review/
COstanzO Test/350 q
Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2022, 8th ed., 336 pages, ISBN 9781975153601
A clear, concise review of physiology that is both comprehensive and efficient, making for fast, easy
reading. Includes excellent high-yield charts and tables, but lacks some figures from Costanzo’s Phys-
iology. Features high-quality practice questions with explanations in each chapter along with a clin-
ically oriented final exam. An excellent reference during times of focused Step 1 studying, but best
if started early in combination with coursework. Respiratory and acid-base sections are comparatively
weak.
B Vander’s Renal Physiology $49 Text
eatOn
McGraw-Hill, 2023, 240 pages, ISBN 9781264278527
Well-written text on renal physiology, with helpful but sparse diagrams and practice questions at the
end of each chapter. Too detailed for Step 1 review, however. Best if used with organ-based coursework
to understand the principles of renal physiology.
B Endocrine Physiology $59 Review
mOLina
McGraw-Hill, 2023, 320 pages, ISBN 9781264278459
Questions at the end of each chapter are helpful solidify knowledge, but some are not representative of
Step 1 questions. Provides more detailed explanations of endocrine physiology than Costanzo review
offers, but much too lengthy for Step 1 review. May be useful as a coursework adjunct.
B Netter’s Physiology Flash Cards $40 Flash cards
muLrOney
Elsevier, 2016, 450 pages, ISBN 9780323359542
Flash cards contain a high-quality illustration on one side with question and commentary on the other.
Good for self-testing, but too fragmented for learning purposes and not comprehensive enough for
boards.
