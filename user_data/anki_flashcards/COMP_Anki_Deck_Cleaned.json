In other words, before glycogen phosphorylase can do its job, it first needs to be&nbsp;phosphorylated and activated by phosphorylase kinase. After the glycogen branch has enough G1P&nbsp;units removed where it is now only four G1P units in length, the first debranching enzyme 1,4-&nbsp;glucosidase removes three of these units, leaving only one left. The second debranching enzyme 1,6-&nbsp;glucosidase&nbsp;removes&nbsp;the&nbsp;final&nbsp;G1P&nbsp;unit.<br><img src=\"\"paste-daf3588d6345af89f4026f6f33803bc31999a6c4.jpg\"\">\""
