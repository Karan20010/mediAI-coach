The infection does not respect tissue planes and spreads contiguously.

It accomplishes this by upregulating the basolateral Na/K-ATPase pump on the basolateral surface of the cortical collecting duct. This cause sodium to be reabsorbed from the tubular cell into the blood, and potassium to be secreted from the blood into the tubular cell. The reduction in intra-tubular cell sodium causes a favorable (high-to-low) gradient from the urine into the cell for sodium. ENaC, on the apical membrane, then opens to enable sodium to flow from the urine into the cell. The movement of sodium through ENaC is considered secondary active transport because sodium is able to move down its apical gradient only because energy was first utilized by the basolateral ATPase pump.<div><br></div><div>- Inhibition of ENaC on the apical membrane means the basolateral ATPase pump can't continue to function, since there's less intracellular sodium to move across the basolateral membrane.
