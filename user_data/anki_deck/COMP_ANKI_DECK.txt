A 32-year-old woman is admitted to hospital following a first-time tonic-clonic seizure. She reports experiencing a dull and diffuse headache the past few weeks which she has attributed to lack of sleep and caffeine. Temperature is 102.4F. Flexion of her neck elicits pain. A CT of the head shows a lesion that appears to be a brain abscess. Empiric treatment with cefotaxime plus metronidazole is commenced.

Once mucosal barriers are breached, and infection is established, the human host responds by initiating an intense inflammatory response which is suppurative and granulomatous. The infection does not respect tissue planes and spreads contiguously.

What drug for USMLE is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor?	Methotrexate
MOA of methotrexate?	Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor (competitive and reversible)
Main side-effects of methotrexate? (3)	<strong>1) Pulmonary fibrosis</strong><div><b><br></b><div>2) Neutropenia (presents as mouth ulcers, fever, rash)</div><div><br></div><div>3) Hepatotoxicity (increased LFTs).</div></div>
Main use of methotrexate?	First-line disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) for rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<div><br></div><div>When we treat RA, we need to address the symptoms (i.e., pain relief) separate from the actual disease progression (DMARDs).</div><div><br></div><div>For symptom relief, we use NSAIDs, followed by corticosteroids (prednisone).</div><div><br></div><div>But independent of symptom relief, patient should be started on methotrexate to slow disease progression.<br></div>
How to overcome toxicity of methotrexate?	Folinic acid (<strong>not</strong> folic acid); this is aka leucovorin rescue.
MOA of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)?	Thymidylate synthesis inhibitor
How to overcome toxicity of 5-FU?	Oral thymidine
MOA of capecitabine?	Metabolized into 5-FU, which in turn inhibits&nbsp;thymidylate synthetase
How to overcome toxicity of capecitabine?	Oral thymidine (same as 5-FU, since it's metabolized into 5-FU)
MOA of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP)?	PRPP amidotransferase inhibitor (inhibits purine synthesis)
Important USMLE use for 6-MP?	Can have utility in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)
Which enzyme activates vs breaks down 6-MP, respectively?	HGPRT activates; xanthine oxidase breaks down
What type of drugs cannot be given with 6-MP, and why?	Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (i.e., allopurinol, febuxostat) because 6-MP requires xanthine oxidase for breakdown
What kind of agents can be given with 6-MP in the treatment of ALL in order to prevent tumor lysis syndrome?	Patients can be administered a urate oxidase analogue, such as rasburicase or pegloticase, both of which breakdown uric acid directly, rather than prevent its formation.<div><br></div><div>Since 6-MP requires xanthine oxidase for breakdown, kids with ALL receiving 6-MP cannot receive xanthine oxidase inhibitors (i.e., allopurinol, febuxostat).</div>
MOA of azathioprine?	<div>Metabolized into 6-MP, which in turn inhibits PRPP-amidotransferase (inhibits purine synthesis.</div><div><br></div><div>Same way capecitabine is a pro-drug of 5-FU (i.e., it is metabolized into 5-FU), azathioprine is a pro-drug of 6-MP.</div><div><br></div><div>Therefore the rule about not combining xanthine oxidase inhibitors with 6-MP also applies to azathioprine.</div>
MOA of mycophenolate mofetil?	Inhibits IMP dehydrogenase
Important USMLE use for mycophenolate?	Lupus nephritis. Pretty much the only factoid you need to know about this one apart from that it inhibits IMP dehydrogenase.

What are two uses of ribavirin?	"Hepatitis C and RSV<br><br>Should be noted that ribavirin is almost always the wrong answer when selecting the treatment for RSV bronchiolitis, but the USMLE still wants you to know that it can be used in select cases. Answer ""supportive care"" for RSV on the USMLE."
Major side-effect of ribavirin?	Hemolytic anemia (yes, USMLE asks this)
MOA of hydroxyurea + what is it used for?	<div>MOA: ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor</div><div><br></div><div>Important use: increases HbF in sickle cell</div>
MOA of leflunomide?	Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase inhibitor
Any notable use for leflunomide?	Can be used in RA if methotrexate is not effective as first-line DMARD
MOA of cyclosporine?	Inhibits cyclophilin (intracellular protein) --&gt; decreases intracellular calcineurin --&gt; decreases&nbsp;IL-2 transcription
Important toxicities of cyclosporine? (4)	<div>Nephrotoxicity (hyperkalemia)</div><div>Hypertension</div><div>Hypertrichosis (â hair growth)</div><div>Gingival hyperplasia</div><div><br></div><div>USMLE wants you to know all of these. This isn't just some random list of arbitrary yieldness.</div>

Which two drugs' toxicities can be overcome with oral thymidine?	5-FU + capecitabine
Which drug inhibits ribonucleotide reductase?	Hydroxyurea
Which drug can increase HbF in sickle cell?	Hydroxyurea
Which two immunosuppressant agents cannot be combined with xanthine oxidase inhibitors?	6-MP + azathioprine. 6-MP requires XO for breakdown. Azathioprine is metabolized into 6-MP.

How do you treat cellulitis, erysipelas, and impetigo?	<div>Mild impetigo: answer = topical mupirocin.</div><div><br></div><div>Classic outpatient Tx for cellulitis, erysipelas, and severe impetigo: oral dicloxacillin or oral cephalexin.</div><div><br></div><div>The inpatient equivalents are IV flucloxacillin and IV cephazolin, respectively.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>First-generation cephalosporins (i.e., cephalexin and cephazolin) are essentially the equivalent of the methicillin-class beta-lactams in that they can cover MSSA.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>90% of community Staph (i.e., MSSA, not MRSA) produce beta-lactamase, so penicillin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin will frequently <strong>not</strong> be effective.

<div>a) What's the empiric Tx for endocarditis?</div><div><br></div><div>b) If patient's blood cultures come back positive for MSSA, do we change the antibiotics; why or why not?</div>	<div>First and foremost, it should be noted that beta-lactams are considered to be very efficacious drugs. If we <em>can</em> use one, we should, because they do the job well. How does that point apply most saliently to real-life medicine?</div><div><br></div>- Empiric Tx for endocarditis (i.e., before we know the organism) is gentamicin PLUS either vancomycin or ampicillin/sulbactam.<div><br></div><div>- The gentamicin covers gram-negatives (rods); the vancomycin covers gram-positives (including MRSA).</div><div><br></div><div>- However, let's say the culture comes back positive for MSSA (i.e., we <em>can</em> use a methicillin-class beta-lactam); the question is:</div><div><br></div><div>--- Do we continue the vancomycin in order to minimize the chance of vancomycin resistance (i.e., stopping a drug early can increase this chance), OR do we switch to nafcillin?</div><div><br></div><div>--- And the answer is: yes, switch to nafcillin (6 weeks).</div><div><br></div><div>- This is because beta-lactams are very efficacious. Vancomycin isn't very efficacious; it just happens to be useful against MRSA if that's what the patient has.</div>
What do we do if someone who has syphilis has a Hx of anaphylaxis to beta-lactams?	"If patient has syphilis (normally treated with penicillin) but has history of anaphylaxis, if the patient's condition is latent-secondary, late-secondary, tertiary, or neurosyphilis, the answer is&nbsp;<strong>densensitize and give penicillin.&nbsp;</strong>You might say, ""Why can't we just treat with another agent?""

What does the USMLE want you to know about NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis treatment?	<div>First-line for pain relief in rheumatoid arthritis; steroids are used for pain if NSAIDs are insufficient. For RA, there are two arms of pharm management:</div><div><br></div><div>- Symptom management only: <strong>NSAIDs first; if insufficient, add steroids.</strong> NSAIDs + steroids do not alter the course of the disease.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>- DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs); not used for symptoms; these slow the course of the disease --&gt; <strong>methotrexate first almost always;</strong> if insufficient, add other agents like anti-TNF-alpha drugs.</div>

How is osteoarthritis treated on USMLE?	<div>If patient is overweight, always choose weight loss first (also obesity = biggest risk factor).</div><div><br></div><div>But if question asks for first-line pharmacologic management, answer = acetaminophen first,&nbsp;<strong>not&nbsp;</strong>NSAIDs. If acetaminophen alone is insufficient, NSAIDs can be added.</div><div><br></div><div>Osteoarthritis is degenerative joint disease. The pain will never go away. So if the patient takes chronic NSAIDs for pain, he or she is prone to renal damage (i.e., peripheral edema in someone taking naproxen for OA).</div>
When is indomethacin the answer on USMLE?	<strong>Indomethacin&nbsp;</strong>is first-line for acute gout.<div><br></div><div>If patient has renal insufficiency, choose corticosteroids over indomethacin.</div><div><br></div><div>If indomethacin and steroids are both not listed but patient has acute attack, answer = colchicine.<br></div>
How is acute pseudogout treated?	NSAIDs, then steroids, then colchicine (same as gout acutely, but NSAID need not be indomethacin).
How is most pericarditis treated?	NSAIDs, then steroids, then colchicine (same as acute gout and pseudogout; NSAID need not be indomethacin).

<div>a) What's the main toxicity of acetaminophen?</div><div><br></div><div>b) How is it treated?</div><div><br></div><div>c) What's the mechanism for the treatment?</div>	<div>a) Severe hepatic necrosis. Acetaminophen is metabolized into a toxic metabolite called NAPQI that is immediately neutralized by reduced glutathione in the liver. If the patient overdoses on acetaminophen, the reduced glutathione is depleted and then the NAPQI oxidizes and diffusely kills the hepatocytes. Whilst NSAIDs and aspirin kill the kidneys, acetaminophen kills the liver.</div><div><br></div><div>b) <em>N-</em>acetylcysteine</div><div><br></div><div>c)</div><div><br></div><div>- USMLE wants you to specifically know the reason&nbsp;<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine works is because&nbsp;<strong>it regenerates reduced glutathione in the liver.</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>- Species with thiol (-SH) groups are in the reduced form and can act as reducing agents (i.e., can act as anti-oxidants).</div><div><br></div><div>- Species with disulfide bonds (-SâS-) are in the oxidized form.</div><div><br></div><div>- Hepatic glutathione has a thiol (-SH) group. So does&nbsp;<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine. After glutathione neutralizes a toxin, it becomes oxidized and inactive.</div><div><br></div><div>- The thiol group on&nbsp;<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine then binds to and frees up the sulfurs on glutathione so that they can once again neutralize toxins.</div><div><br></div><div>- This mechanism may sound cumbersome, but itâs HY for USMLE. Probably because&nbsp;<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine is such an important antidote used clinically.</div><div><br></div><div>- Activated charcoal can be used in select acute circumstances. Thereâs a Qbank Q floating around where activated charcoal is the answer over&nbsp;<em>N</em>-acetylcysteine.&nbsp;<strong>On the USMLE, however, always&nbsp;</strong><strong>choose&nbsp;<em>N-</em>acetylcysteine for acetaminophen.</strong></div>

What's an important use of probenecid that has nothing to do with gout?	Maintains serum beta-lactam levels. Organic anion transporter (OAT) in the proximal tubules of the kidney not only functions to reabsorb uric acid, but it also secretes beta-lactam into the urine. Probenecid can be added to beta-lactam regimens to help maintain serum levels. USMLE loves this detail.
MOA of rasburicase?	Urate oxidase analogue (cleaves uric acid directly)
How is acute gout treated?	<div><strong>What the USMLE wants:</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div>- If the patient has no apparent contraindications to any medications and indomethacin, steroids, and colchicine are all listed, choose indomethacin.<div><br></div><div>- If indomethacin and steroids are not listed, colchicine will be the answer they want for acute attacks.</div><div><br></div><div>- If the patient has renal insufficiency or history of renal transplant, choose corticosteroids.</div>
How does 6-mercaptopurine, a chemotherapeutic agent, relate to gout?	Allopurinol and febuxostat are xanthine oxidase inhibitors used in the treatment of <strong>chronic gout,</strong> not acute flares.&nbsp;These are not to be used in patients taking 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), since the latter requires xanthine oxidase for breakdown (i.e., allopurinol or febuxostat can cause â serum 6-MP levels â 6-MP toxicity).
How is chronic gout treated (i.e., what is given between episodes in patients with multiple attacks in order to decrease recurrence)?	<div>Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (i.e., allopurinol or febuxostat) are first-line.</div><div><br></div><div>Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are second-line if XOi are not effective. However these latter agents are not used in patients with history of uric acid stones or in those who are uric acid over-producers (i.e., tumor lysis syndrome; Lesch-Nyhan syndrome).</div>
MOA of sulfinpyrazone?	<div>Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone are a uricosurics (i.e., increase urinary excretion of uric acid) used in the treatment of <strong>chronic gout,</strong> not acute flares.

MOA of mannitol? / Where does it act in the nephron?	<div>Osmotic diuretic; acts in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), proximal straight tubule (PST), and descending loop of Henle.</div><div><br></div><div>Osmotic diuretic means it functions to retain water in the lumen of the nephron by exerting an oncotic effect (i.e., the mere presence of more solute in the lumen means water is less likely to be reabsorbed --&gt; more is micturated).</div>
When is mannitol used?	<div>Can be used to treat increased intracranial pressure.</div><div><br></div><div>The sequence of treatment is: elevate head of the bed --&gt; intubation + hyperventilation (decreased CO2 causes decreased cerebral perfusion) --&gt; mannitol. In other words, mannitol is never the first answer for increased intracranial pressure; just know that it can be used for this purpose.</div>
When is mannitol notably contraindicated?	Don't give to patients with heart failure --&gt; increased oncotic pressure occurs in the peripheral vasculature as well --&gt; transient increase in plasma volume --&gt; increased venous return --&gt; increased oxygen demand on the myocardium --&gt; increased risk of cardiac decompensation and ischemia.
MOA of acetazolamide? / Where does it act in the nephron?	<div>Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in the PCT of the kidney.</div><div><br></div><div>Carbonic anhydrase functions to facilitate CO2 and H2O combining to form H2CO3. Once H2CO3 is formed, it can equilibrate into bicarb and a proton. The bicarb is then reabsorbed by the PCT tubular cell.</div><div><br></div><div>In other words, if we inhibit carbonic anhydrase with acetazolamide, less bicarb is reabsorbed, thereby creating a metabolic acidosis for the patient.</div>
When is acetazolamide used?	<div>Altitude sickness --&gt; person goes to high altitude where there's fractionally less O2 in the air --&gt; breathes faster to compensate --&gt; also results in blowing off more CO2 --&gt; patient becomes transiently alkalotic because it takes time for the kidney to naturally excrete more bicarb to compensate for the reduced serum pCO2. The role of acetazolamide is to create a transient metabolic acidosis by forcing bicarb excretion; this compensates for the respiratory alkalosis faster than the kidney can naturally excrete bicarb.</div><div><br></div><div>Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can be used for glaucoma by decreasing aqueous humor production.</div>
What are two adverse effects of acetazolamide?	<div>1) Sulfa drug (contraindicated in sulfa allergy).</div><div><br></div><div>2) Because it increased the pH of the urine, it can theoretically increase the risk of calcium phosphate stones (which form at higher pH). Calcium oxalate stones, in contrast, form at lower pH, so risk of these would not be increased.</div>

MOA of loops? / Where do they act in the loop of Henle?	<div>Inhibit the Na/K/2Cl (one sodium, one potassium, and two chloride) symporter on the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle.</div><div><br></div><div>When ions are reabsorbed, water follows, so inhibition of this four-ion symporter causes massive diuresis (increased urination).</div>
What's the effect of loops and thiazides on calcium?	<div>Loops decrease paracellular (between the cells, without a transporter) reabsorption of calcium and magnesium. That is, loops also cause hypercalciuria (and can cause hypocalcemia). The USMLE likes you to know the effect of loops on calcium.</div><div><br></div><div>In contrast, thiazides cause increased calcium reabsorption in the DCT.

Once again, just memorize: ""loops abolish the effects of vasopressin.""</div><div><br></div><div>Sulfa allergy. Ethacrynic acid is used if patient has sulfa allergy.</div></div>"
MOA of thiazides? / Where do they act in the nephron?	<div>Block the Na/Cl symporter on the apical membrane of the early-DCT.</div><div><br></div><div>This results in increased calcium reabsorption in the DCT. That is, thiazides cause hypocalciuria and hypercalcemia. Note that this is the opposite effect of loop diuretics. The USMLE wants you to know this contrast of effect urinary and serum on calcium.</div>
When are thiazides used?	<div>First-line treatment for essential hypertension in patients without pre-diabetes, diabetes, renal, or cardiovascular disease. In other words, thiazides or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine) are used for otherwise healthy patients who have essential hypertension. This shows up on 2CK FM material (i.e., patient has HTN and hydrochlorothiazide is the answer).</div><div><br></div>- If the patient has pre-diabetes, diabetes, renal, or cardiovascular disease, use an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). As an example, if the patient has elevated fasting glucose or evidence of protein in the urine, use an ACEi or ARB, not a thiazide or dCCB.<div><br></div><div>- Used to prevent recurrent calcium urolithiasis (because they cause hypocalciuria).</div>
Adverse effects of thiazides?	<div>Hyper<strong>GLUC</strong></div><div><br></div>- Hyper<strong>G</strong>lycemia --&gt; can cause diabetes, or push pre-diabetics into diabetes; so never use in patients with elevated fasting glucose.

MOA of amiloride and triamterine? / Where in the nephron do they act?	<div>ENaC inhibitors (inhibit sodium reabsorption in the late-DCT and cortical collecting duct).</div><div><br></div><div>Water follows sodium, so inhibition of ENaC promotes diuresis.</div><div><br></div><div>Potassium-sparing (i.e., do not cause a decrease in serum potassium).</div><div><br></div>- Aldosterone normally promotes potassium secretion distally in the kidney. It accomplishes this by upregulating the basolateral Na/K-ATPase pump on the basolateral surface of the cortical collecting duct. This cause sodium to be reabsorbed from the tubular cell into the blood, and potassium to be secreted from the blood into the tubular cell. The reduction in intra-tubular cell sodium causes a favorable (high-to-low) gradient from the urine into the cell for sodium. ENaC, on the apical membrane, then opens to enable sodium to flow from the urine into the cell. The movement of sodium through ENaC is considered secondary active transport because sodium is able to move down its apical gradient only because energy was first utilized by the basolateral ATPase pump.<div><br></div><div>- Inhibition of ENaC on the apical membrane means the basolateral ATPase pump can't continue to function, since there's less intracellular sodium to move across the basolateral membrane. In turn, this means less potassium can be secreted, so serum potassium is maintained (i.e., ENaC inhibitors are potassium-sparing).</div>
When are amiloride and triamterine used?	<div>When the patient needs a potassium-sparing diuretic.</div><div><br></div><div>Used as second agents for fluid unloading when the patient is already on a loop diuretic (usually furosemide).

The potassium-sparing ones will not cause hypokalemia (can actually cause hyperkalemia).</div>
MOA of spironolactone and eplerenone? / Where do they act in the nephron?	<div>Aldosterone receptor antagonists.</div><div><br></div><div>Potassium-sparing.</div><div><br></div><div>By blocking aldosterone receptors, there's decreased activity of the Na/K-ATPase pumps on the basolateral membrane of the late-DCT and cortical collecting duct --&gt; less Na reabsorption --&gt; since water follows sodium, there's less water reabsorption --&gt; decreased plasma volume.

"âWhat do you mean
fragmentation of RBCs leading to schistocytosis?â&nbsp;"	"<div>&nbsp;schistocytes
are caused by the
fragmentation/shearing of RBCs intravascularly. TTP is one of the common
causes. The others are hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), DIC, HELLP syndrome in pregnancy, and mechanical
hemolysis (prosthetic heart valves).</div>"
"âCan you explain HUS?
And I confuse it sometimes with TTP.â&nbsp;"	"<div>&nbsp;therefore
the combination of thrombocytopenia + schistocytosis (often
seen in a Q as a combo of low platelets + low Hb + normal
WBC count) should set off alarm bells for HUS and TTP. Because this
process occurs in microvasculature,
this is why the combo of thrombocytopenia and schistocytosis is referred to as microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA).

<div><ul><li>Whereas TTP presents with a

pediatric + bloody diarrhea (EHEC or Shigella); TTP will usually be an adult who presents with fever and
stroke-like Sx + who also has the triad youâd expect to see in HUS. The tricky thing about TTP is
that episodes can be triggered by various etiologies, such as viral
infection, but the vignette will not give bloody diarrhea.</li></ul><ul><li>Tx for HUS is supportive with intravenous fluids;

<div>&nbsp;Diagnosis is Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome, which is
hemorrhagic necrosis of the adrenal glands
secondary to meningococcal septicemia. Both the zona glomerulosa
(aldosterone-producing layer) and
zona fasciculata (cortisol-producing layer) are affected. The zona reticularis
(androgen-producing layer) could in theory
be affected, but donât worry about that here.</div><div><br></div>
<div>-&nbsp; &nbsp;Cortisol normally functions
to upregulate a1-receptors on arterioles.
Catecholamines (norepinephrine and
epinephrine) agonize these receptors and cause vasoconstriction, thereby
maintaining blood pressure. If cortisol is low, then NE and E canât
do their job, so BP is low.</div><div><br></div>
<div>-&nbsp;If the USMLE asks which drug to give in this setting (following the administration of normal saline),
the answer = hydrocortisone, which is a cortisol analogue. If you give
NE, it wonât significantly increase BP since a1-receptors arenât
being expressed adequately due to the low cortisol.</div>
<div><br></div><div>-&nbsp; &nbsp;Low aldosterone would in
theory cause low BP from less fluid retention, but in the case of W-F syndrome,
the low BP is more an acute effect of â cortisol, resulting

<div>-&nbsp;ADH causes the insertion of

<div>-Urinary osmolality refers to your concentration of solutes within the urine. The urine is becoming
more concentrated because
free water is being pulled
out.</div>
<div>-Urinary specific gravity is

primary or secondary hypo- vs hyperthyroidism; answer is secondary hyperthyroidism. Not difficult. But Iâm just making a
point that the NBME has asked this point-blank without
any type of substantive vignette
or disease application.</div>"
"<div>In primary vs secondary hypothyroidism, what are the arrows (i.e.,
â, â, or â) for TSH, T3, and T4?</div>"	"<div>Primary hypothyroidism: â <b>TSH, </b>â <b>T3, </b>â <b>T4.</b></div>

<div>Secondary hypothyroidism: â <b>TSH, </b>â <b>T3, </b>â <b>T4.</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-Primary hypothyroidism
traditionally refers to Hashimoto and iodine deficiency. TSH is high because of decreased negative
feedback at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary by T3 and T4.</div>
<div>-Secondary hypothyroidism is typically seen in Sheehan
syndrome. Yes, Sheehan
is classically â prolactin, but NBME has also assessed TSH as decreased
as well</div>"
"<div>33F + exophthalmos +

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-&nbsp; Diagnosis
is Graves disease.
Exophthalmos (proptosis) is only seen in Graves disease.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Mechanism
is autoimmune production of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- TSI is structurally similar to TSH and will agonize the TSH receptor
(type II hypersensitivity).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Relevance of type I diabetes
is that âautoimmune diseases go togetherâ â i.e., if a patient has one autoimmune disease (i.e., SLE, RA, IBD,
etc.), there is increased risk of another. HLA associations are very loose on USMLE. Do not try to overthink based on specific
HLAs. This will get you Qs wrong.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Uptake of iodine into the
thyroid gland signifies that the thyroid gland is producing thyroid hormone. In Graves, the uptake is diffusely
increased. If uptake is increased in one area only, the answer is toxic adenoma. If uptake demonstrates multiple
areas of uptake in an elderly patient, the answer is toxic multinodular goiter.</div>
<div><br></div><div>If a patient has
hyperthyroidism but decreased uptake, the answer is thyroiditis of some kind
(i.e., drug-induced, deQuervain, or
postpartum). In thyroiditis, the patient can be either hypo- or hyperthyroid; in the event he/she is
hyperthyroid, the mechanism is increased release of thyroid hormone due to inflammation of the gland;
the gland itself is not producing (which is why uptake is low, not high).<br></div>"

<div>-&nbsp;Mechanism is mixed antibody-
(anti-thyroperoxidase [aka anti-microsomal], anti-thyroglobuin) and T cell-mediated destruction of the thyroid gland.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Uptake is diffusely
decreased, or will be described as âpatchy uptakeâ in a stem where the patient clearly
has Hashimoto.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Descriptors such as brittle
hair, dry skin, constipation, and cold intolerance are too easy for many USMLE
Qs. Donât rely on these
as a crutch.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Students need to be aware of
menstrual irregularities, bradycardia, dysthymia/depression, hepatic transaminitis, dyslipidemia, and myopathy
(increased CK) as important parts of the disease.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2CK IM Qs in particular will
give findings such as high AST (or ALT) and CK in a patient with bradycardia and fatigue and expect you to know that is Hashimoto.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diagnosis
is deQuervain (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis; or just subacute
thyroiditis).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mechanism is viral infection
followed by a <b>painful/tender </b>thyroid.
There is inflammation of the thyroid
gland, which causes the spacing between the cells to increase slightly,
allowing for the release of pre-formed thyroid hormone into the blood. The gland is not over-producing thyroid
hormone. This is why uptake
is not increased.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Viral infections are often
asymptomatic, so most deQuervain vignettes will not mention the viral infection.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subacute granulomatous
thyroiditis can be either hypo- or hyperthyroid. The key detail you need to know is that <b>uptake is always
decreased <i>even if the patient is hyper-.</i></b></div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DeQuervain vignettes will
almost always be given as hyperthyroidism because the USMLE wants to specifically assess that you know uptake
is decreased. If they give you hypo-, of course youâll select decreased for uptake.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Decreased uptake applies to
all thyroiditis conditions (i.e, deQuervain, drug-induced, and postpartum).</div>"

<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Diagnosis
is medullary thyroid
carcinoma. Serum calcitonin will also be elevated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Patients with thyroid
carcinoma (i.e., papillary, follicular, medullary, anaplastic) will be either euthyroid or hypothyroid; they will not be hyperthyroid.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the patient has a thyroid
nodule and is hyperthyroid, the diagnosis is toxic adenoma.
Adenomas are non-malignant tumors (i.e., they do not
have metastatic potential). Carcinomas have metastatic potential.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It should be noted that on 2CK FM Qs, choose
âpalpation of thyroid
glandâ before âcheck
serum TSHâ if the patient
requests thyroid cancer
screening.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If patient with nodule has
normal or high TSH (i.e., euthyroid or hypothyroid), do ultrasound before fine-needle aspiration. This is assessed
on the new 2CK Free 120, where ultrasound is correct over FNA for evaluation of thyroid nodule. It
had long been pushed in resources that ultrasound is always wrong.
But this is on Free 120.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2CK IM Q gives euthyroid
patient with nodule
where FNA is the answer,
but ultrasound not listed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So my conclusion (based on
NBME/Free 120 content, not my opinion) is: for eu- or hypothyroid patient
with thyroid nodule,
ultrasound is correct
over FNA if both are listed. If ultrasound isnât listed but FNA is, FNA is correct.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If patient has low TSH (i.e., hyperthyroid), do radioiodine (131I) uptake scan, not ultrasound.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Since carcinomas are non-secretory of thyroid
hormone, if a patient is hyperthyroid, weâre not concerned about carcinoma, which is why we donât go the USS then
FNA route. We just do uptake to better
see if the patientâs etiology for hyperthyroidism is Graves (diffuse), toxic
adenoma (single nodular uptake),
or toxic multinodular goiter (multifocal nodular
uptake<br>"
"<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Patient is injecting triiodothyronine
(T3). What are the arrows (i.e., â, â, or â) for TSH, T3, T4, and radioiodine (131I) uptake

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>This is a âhardâ question.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Diagnosis is factitious (or surreptitious) thyrotoxicosis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Remember, T4 is converted to T3, but T3 is not converted to T4.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Triiodothyronine is T3. Thyroxine
is T4.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If we inject T3, we will
suppress TSH due to negative feedback. In turn, the thyroid gland will be under-stimulated, so uptake is low. The
thyroid gland will often be described as âsmall and non- palpable.â Since the thyroid gland will be under-stimulated (we
donât need production if weâre injecting it), <b>production
of T4 will be reduced.</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;This arrow combo for T3 injection is on one of the retired Step 1 NBMEs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;âBut Michael, what about T4 injection then?â
â Ok, go to the next question.</div>"
"<div>Patient is injecting
levothyroxine (T4). What are the arrows (i.e., â, â, or â) for TSH, T3, T4, and radioiodine (131I) uptake

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>T4 is converted to T3, so if we inject T4, we will also have high T3.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;High T3 and T4 cause
suppression of TSH, which in turn leads to decreased iodine uptake into the thyroid
gland.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Remember, T3 is not
converted to T4. If we inject triiodothyronine, T3 will be high, but T4 will be
low because weâre not able to produce
it if we shut off the thyroid
gland.</div>
<div>&nbsp;It is not sufficient to merely ask, âIf patient
injects thyroid hormone,
what will the arrows be?â We need to specify
whether itâs T3 or T4 weâre
injecting.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Some students might say,
âWait, if TSH is low, and thatâs the reason our 131I uptake is low, then why isnât uptake low in Graves
disease for instance.
Cuz isnât TSH low in Graves?â
â TSH is low in Graves, but donât forget that the mechanism for
that disease is TSI production, which mimics TSH, thereby stimulating the gland to make thyroid
hormone.</div><div><br></div>
<div>In the case of toxic adenoma
and toxic multinodular goiter, even though TSH is low, uptake is high because
those conditions are tumorous, where the gland is autonomously producing and secreting
thyroid hormones without
the need for TSH.</div>"

TBG will mop up free T4,
causing free T4 to transiently decrease and TSH to rise (less negative feedback). This rise in TSH will stimulate
more production of T4 by the thyroid gland, making total T4 go up. The absolute amount of free T4
will increase back to normal, thereby suppressing TSH back to normal.
But the <i>total </i>amount of T4 is now increased â i.e., free T4 is normal again,

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><ul><li>&nbsp;In order to understand
tertiary hyperparathyroidism, letâs first review secondary hyperparathyroidism:</li><li>Patients with renal failure
will initially develop secondary hyperparathyroidism, where calcium is low, phosphate is high, and PTH is high.
Calcium is low due to failure of reabsorption at the late-DCT of the kidney and because of decreased
synthesis of activated vitamin D3 (leading to decreased small bowel absorption). Phosphate is high due to
failure to downregulate PCT reabsorption pumps (i.e., more pumps reabsorb phosphate). PTH is high because calcium
is low (less negative feedback).</li><li>Tertiary hyperparathyroidism
results from hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands in patients with long- standing secondary hyperparathyroidism,
such that even if the renal failure is brought under control and serum calcium is brought back into the
normal range, PTH continues being autonomously
secreted at higher basal levels than prior to the renal disease,
effectively resetting the bodyâs setpoint for calcium
homeostasis.</li><li>This causes a rise in serum
calcium in a patient with renal failure. This should immediately raise a red flag
for tertiary hyperPTH,
since renal failure
patients will almost always have low, not high, calcium.</li><li>&nbsp; Even though the parathyroid
glands will be hyper-secreting PTH, this is not primary hyperparathyroidism, since the etiology for the high PTH was not idiopathic adenoma or hyperplasia.</li><li>&nbsp;Phosphate is high, not low,
because the patient has renal failure. Phosphate is always high in renal failure. Even though PTH is high, remember
that the kidney canât downregulate the PCT reabsorption pumps the way theyâre supposed
to.</li></ul></div>

<div><ul><li>The Step 1 NBME wants you to know the findings for vitamin D receptor insensitivity.</li><li>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Since vitamin D causes
intestinal absorption of calcium, serum calcium will be low. The low calcium causes
PTH to go up (due to decreased negative feedback).</li><li>The NBME doesnât ask about
phosphate levels for this condition, possibly because whilst vitamin D deficiency will ordinarily cause low
phosphate (due to decreased intestinal absorption), it is possible that in patients with chronically
elevated PTH in the setting of a vitamin D receptor mutation, phosphate
might be variable.</li><li>&nbsp;Recall that inactive
25-OH-D3 can be converted to another inactive storage form called 24,25-D3. If PTH is high, then 1a-hydroxylase activity is high, so there will be less 25-D3
available to be shunted to 24,25-D3.
The NBME mentions 24,25-D3 levels as âundetectableâ in the setting of vitamin D
receptor mutation. This also means if USMLE asks you for merely the 25-OH-D3
levels, choose a down arrow.</li><li>The NBME gives normal serum levels for 1,25-(OH)2-D3. This might sound weird, since if
thereâs a mutation in
the vitamin D receptor, then theoretically more 1,25-D3 should be produced to compensate. This explains the low

<div><ul><li>&nbsp;Diagnosis is polycystic
ovarian syndrome (PCOS). The mechanism is linked with high BMI and insulin resistance, which precipitates abnormal
GnRH pulsation with a characteristic â LH/FSH ratio.</li><li>Some students will ask if
FSH is increased along with LH, but if itâs just merely within the ratio that
FSH is low. The answer
is no. If the USMLE
asks for the LH and FSH arrows
separately, do not choose an up-arrow for FSH. Choose a down-arrow.</li><li>&nbsp;LH stimulates theca interna cells to produce
androgens, which in turn are increased.<br></li><li>FSH causes the granulosa
cells to produce aromatase. Although FSH is low, estrogen in patients with PCOS is usually
in the normal range.<br></li><li>&nbsp;The LH spike will normally
trigger ovulation. FSH normally causes
follicular development.</li><li>Since FSH is low, this means
follicular development is insufficient by the time LH is ready to trigger ovulation. Ovulation will therefore not
occur because a Graafian follicle will not be ready to rupture. A corpus
luteum (follicular remnant), in turn, will not form.<br></li><li>&nbsp; The corpus luteum normally
secretes progesterone, which maintains the endometrial lining. If we do not ovulate, we will not secrete progesterone during the menstrual
cycle.</li><li>&nbsp;The corpus luteum will
naturally degrade over the 2-week luteal/secretory phase of the menstrual cycle if fertilization does not occur.
This is because human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from a placenta
serves the purpose
of maintaining the corpus luteum.</li><li>Menstruation is caused by
the presence, then withdrawal of, progesterone. If progesterone isnât secreted (then withdrawn) because we donât
get a corpus luteum (followed by its apoptosis in the absence of fertilization), then there canât be menstruation,
which is why we get missed periods in PCOS.</li><li>The clinical relevance of
PCOS is not only does it cause subfertility in women, but it is also a risk
factor for endometrial cancer.
Estrogen causes growth of endometrium. Progesterone limits growth of endometrium. In patients with PCOS, their
lifetime production of progesterone is lower. We call this âunopposed estrogen,â where estrogenâs
proliferative effects on endometrium go unchecked when progesterone isnât there,
so endometrial hyperplasia and atypia are more prone to occur.</li></ul></div>

pregnancy are attributed to rising hCG levels during the first 8-10 weeks. Recall that the purpose of hCG (secreted

remnant from ovulation) so that it can continue secreting progesterone, which in turn will maintain
the endometrial lining
and the pregnancy.<br></li><li>&nbsp;At 8-10 weeks, the placenta will begin taking over production of progesterone, thereby

azotemia, for intra- and postrenal failure, BUN/Cr is lower and FeNa higher because the kidney is not trying to
reabsorb urea and sodium to compensate for reduced renal perfusion. In prerenal, urea and sodium reabsorption occurs so
that water can follow them, which assists in fluid retention and restoration of blood volume.</li></ul></div>

<div><ul><li>Acetazolamide is a carbonic
anhydrase inhibitor that can act as a diuretic. By preventing the combination of and CO2 and H2O in the PCT of the kidney to make H2CO3, there is
lesser equilibration into HCO3- and H+. Normally HCO3- is reabsorbed by the PCT. Since acetazolamide inhibits this process,
it causes a metabolic acidosis.<br></li><li>&nbsp;Since less bicarbonate is reabsorbed, there is less Na+ and K+ cation reabsorption that occurs concurrently. Since water follows
ions, there is less water reabsorption â diuresis.</li><li>&nbsp; Bicarbonate
is basic, so more bicarb
in the urine means greater
urine pH.</li><li>Acetazolamide can be used
for altitude sickness. At higher altitude, O2 tension is lower, so the patient will hyperventilate in an attempt to
achieve adequate oxygenation. This causes CO2 to be expired, resulting in an acute respiratory
alkalosis. The kidney, however, will take a minimum of 12-24 hours to increase bicarbonate excretion to
appreciably compensate. In the meantime, the patient can take acetazolamide to effectively force the kidney
to excrete the bicarb faster
than it normally
would.<br></li></ul>&nbsp;It should be noted that with acetazolamide, we also have:<br><ol><li>&nbsp;â serum volume, â serum bicarbonate, â serum pH.<br></li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp;Just be careful

<div>-&nbsp; Diagnosis is acute exacerbation of COPD (usually
due to viral infection).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;This CO2 pattern
is the exception to the high respiratory rate rule for USMLE.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Normally, we said that when
patients hyperventilate, their CO2 is low. This is the case for probably 14/15 USMLE Qs. The exception is acute
exacerbation of COPD, where patients will have âchronic respiratory acidosis and acute respiratory acidosis,â (aka âacute on chronic,â
but Iâve seen it written
the long way on a 2CK NBME Q).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Patients with COPD (chronic
bronchitis + emphysema) will have decreased alveolar surface area available for gas exchange and are
therefore chronic CO2 retainers. This means they have chronic respiratory acidosis <b>(</b>â <b>CO2, </b>â <b>HCO3</b><b>-</b><b>, </b>â <b>pH). </b>Bicarbonate
goes up because the patientâs respiratory acidosis
is chronic, so the kidney has more than enough time to compensate. Since CO2 is
acidic, we want to retain alkaline
bicarb to compensate.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;When a viral illness
precipitates an acute exacerbation of COPD, the decrease in alveolar surface
area available for gas exchange
means that <i>even if the patient
hyperventilates, CO2 will still be high</i>. In other words, in patients with severe COPD, even though CO2
diffuses quickly, it still canât get out because the decreased alveolar
surface area precludes
CO2 from effectively leaving the capillaries.</div>
<div>-There is a 2CK NBME Q
floating around where they give a respiratory rate of 32 in a guy with severe COPD, and they show CO2 as 80 mmHg (NR 33-44).
The answer is âchronic respiratory acidosis and acute respiratory acidosis.â That is, the patient has an acute

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-&nbsp;Opioids (such as morphine), barbiturates, and benzodiazepines can all cause respiratory depression and respiratory acidosis. CO2 is increased
since respiratory rate is low (NR 12-16/minute).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;A-a gradient is the difference between the oxygen
levels in the alveoli and the arterioles.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;A-a gradient is normal because
alveolar and arteriolar oxygen are both low.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Most students assume that
any lung issue automatically = high A-a gradient. But think about what this means for a second: in hypoventilation
(e.g., from opioids), the only reason the patientâs arteriolar oxygen is low <i>is because he or she is hypoventilating</i>. So of course
alveolar oxygen is also low.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;In contrast, if we have,
e.g., pulmonary fibrosis, A-a gradient would be high because the patient can get O2 into the alveoli just fine. It is
merely the case that the oxygen canât get into the arteries, so the difference between the alveoli
and arterioles is high.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;The USMLE does not expect
you to know normal A-a numerical ranges. They will merely give you answer choices where some answer choices
are, e.g., 40, and the others are, e.g., 8, and you can easily infer that youâd pick the one that says 8 for opioids, barbiturates, or benzos.</div>"

<div>-&nbsp;Needing to sleep on pillows
in order to breathe properly is called orthopnea. This is common in patients with left heart failure. When the
patient lies flat, there is increased venous return to the right heart
â increased preload

<div>â pulmonary edema
+ difficulty breathing. So if the patient sleeps on pillows â slightly less venous return to right heart â left heart can tolerate lower preload slightly
better â less pulmonary edema.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Fluid in the lungs impairs
gas exchange across the alveolar capillaries. The patient can oxygenate his alveoli just fine, but merely canât get
the oxygen into the capillaries because fluid is sitting there. This means A-a is high (alveolar oxygen is high/good, but arteriolar is low).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Pulmonary capillary wedge
pressure is the pressure sensed by a catheter tip if it is inserted through the right heart and into a distal
pulmonary capillary. The pressure waves it senses come from the left atrium.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Cor pulmonale is defined
as right heart failure due to a pulmonary cause (i.e., COPD, CF, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Recall that PCWP = LAP. PCWP
is normal in cor pulmonale because the left heart is unaffected. Cor pulmonale
is specifically when we have a problem
starting with the lungs and backing up to the right heart;
the left heart
is normal so PCWP (LAP)
should be normal.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Loud P2 (pulmonic component
of S2) = pulmonary hypertension on USMLE. The pulmonic valve slams shut because of the increased distal pressure in the pulmonary circulation.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Right bundle branch block
usually = right ventricular hypertrophy on USMLE. (Likewise, LBBB often = LVH).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Patients with CF have
exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, with decreased ability to absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Although the patient could
theoretically produce vitamin D from the skin, dietary consumption is still important for normal vitamin D levels.
Cholecalciferol is the type of vitamin D3 found in most foods
and supplements.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Cholecalciferol will go to the liver
and be hydroxylated into 25-OH-D3
(calcidiol).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Since 25-OH-D3 is in equilibrium with 24,25-(OH)2-D3, if 25-OH is low, then 24,25-D3 is also low.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;If you werenât sure which vitamin
D form is absorbed from food, another
way to think about it is: if patients
with CF are prone to vitamin D deficiency, that can cause low Ca2+ absorption from the bowel, which in turn would increase PTH,
which in turn would upregulate 1a-hydroxylase,
which would convert more 25-OH-D3
into 1,25-(OH)2-D3, thereby

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp; In pulmonary fibrosis, perfusion
(Q) is unaffected (i.e., thereâs
no problem with blood flow to the lungs).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;However, the fibrosis means
some parts of the alveoli will be under-ventilated because inhaled oxygen
wonât be able to reach
them, so ventilation (V) is reduced.
This means V/Q is low.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;In contrast, V/Q is high in pulmonary
embolism, since blood flow (perfusion; Q) is reduced.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;<b>High V/Q = dead space

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Shunt and dead space can
apply physiologically (i.e., no pathology) to the lungs notably when the patient is upright. Both ventilation and
perfusion increase from apex to base, but fluid sinks more than air due to gravity,
so perfusion increases <i>more </i>than
ventilation from apex to base.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;This means at the bases, Q
has increased a lot, so V/Q is lower (natural shunt) at the bases. V/Q is around

<div>-&nbsp;ARDS is an inflammatory lung condition in which proteinaceous exudate floods the alveolar spaces.</div>
<div>&nbsp;ARDS is always bilateral. Since the left heart is not the cause of the

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;Propranolol
is a non-specific beta-blocker at both b1 and b2 receptors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;b1 blockade results in lower heart rate (chronotropy) and contractility (inotropy).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The slower the heart rate,
the greater the fraction of the cardiac cycle is spent in diastole relative to systole. Since the heart fills during
diastole, if the heart rate is slower, end-ventricular diastolic volume is greater.</div>
<div>&nbsp;A student might say, âWait,
but if beta-blockers increase preload, then how could they possibly decrease
oxygen demand, cuz doesnât higher preload mean higher oxygen demand on myocardium?â</div>
<div>â we have a net decrease in oxygen demand
because the effect
of the reduced chronotropy and inotropy outweigh
the increase in preload.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Cardiac output is lower because
heart rate and contractility are lower.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;b2 agonism causes peripheral arteriolar dilation (i.e.,
reduces systemic vascular
resistance).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Therefore, b2 antagonism causes less peripheral vasodilation and greater
resistance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; Even if you didnât know the
above point about b2, another way to think of it is:
if cardiac output decreases due to
beta-blockade, then we would theoretically want increased peripheral vasoconstriction to compensate (i.e.,
if we have lower cardiac
output, then we want more resistance to maintain BP).</div>"

<div>&nbsp;Remember that CN X (Vagus

addition, sympathetic firing would increase to the heart as a result of lower
cardiac output.</div>

<div>&nbsp;The question here forces you
to choose an acid-base disturbance in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction where BP is low (cardiogenic shock).</div>
<div>USMLE wants you to know that
in any type of shock (i.e., cardiogenic, septic, hypovolemic), lactic acidosis can occur secondary to increased peripheral anaerobic glycolysis.</div>
<div>If tissues arenât being
perfused as well as they should be, then they are not being oxygenated as well as they should
be â increased anaerobic respiration + lactate
production â lactic acidosis + reduced
serum bicarbonate.</div>
<div>CO2 is blown off to compensate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have also seen Qs where bicarb
is low in severe pulmonary
embolism and dehydration.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I talked about earlier how
PE should be acute respiratory alkalosis. However, I have seen one 2CK- level Q where
they gave low pH in PE + a low CO2 â only way thatâs possible
is if bicarb is low due to lactic acidosis.
In theory, this would be a mixed metabolic acidosis-respiratory alkalosis.</div>
<div>This concept of lactic acidosis
in the setting of shock is exceedingly HY for USMLE.</div>

because the heart canât pump, we expect systemic vascular resistance to go up to compensate.</div>

<div>Cardiac output is increased because venous return is high. Even though
there may be some swelling
in patients with anaphylaxis,
fluid for the most part has not left the vessels. Blood pressure is low because SVR is low, but the blood is still
being returned venously to the heart. This, combined with high heart rate, contributes to overall
high cardiac output. The literature/Google will frequently mention
how cardiac output
is decreased in anaphylaxis, but this is wrong on USMLE.</div>
<div>PCWP = left atrial pressure.

the USMLE will force you to choose an

you can say, âOk, cool, not cardiogenic shock.â (But you have to look at other variables
still in order to diagnose)</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Diagnosis
is von Willebrand disease (vWD),
an autosomal dominant
condition.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;vWF normally bridges
glycoprotein Ib on platelets to vascular endothelium / underlying collagen
(i.e., it acts as a bridging agent
that enables platelet
adhesion).</div>
<div>&nbsp;Vignettes will almost always
give a presentation that entails a mix of one clotting factor problem (i.e., heavy menses, excessive bleeding after
tooth extraction) and one platelet problem (i.e., usually mild, cutaneous findings such as petechiae, or epistaxis).</div>
<div>&nbsp;Because platelet function
is fucked up, we know bleeding time is high.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;vWF has a secondary
role where it helps stabilize
factor VIII in plasma. Therefore, we sometimes get elevated aPTT in the condition. But it need not be elevated.</div><div><b>It is to my observation
that ~50% of vWD Qs on NBME will have normal aPTT; the other ~50% will have elevated aPTT.</b></div>

<div>-Etiologies for DIC are

<div>-&nbsp;Diagnosis is iron deficiency
anemia (IDA). IDA is common in young women due to their menses, even if theyâre not heavy. Iâve seen 2CK FM Qs
where they specifically say a womanâs menses are normal/not heavy + pale RBCs on smear,
then the answer
is IDA.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;MCV, hematocrit, serum iron, and serum ferritin
are all low simply because
iron availability is low.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Ferritin is a storage form
of iron that is the most sensitive indicator of iron status. For instance, if serum iron is low but ferritin is
normal, the patient does not have iron deficiency (this pattern is consistent with anemia of chronic disease).</div>
<div>-Transferrin is the carrier
molecule for iron. Saturation of transferrin is low in IDA since transferrin levels are high (the body is trying hard
to transport more iron when levels are low). In addition, the binding
sites for iron on the transferrin are sparsely occupied.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Red cell distribution width (RDW)
refers to the spectrum/range of RBC sizes. If we have a wide range of sizes, RDW is up. If we have a narrow range of sizes,
RDW is down.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;<b>RDW is high in IDA. </b>Low iron in the bone marrow results in a
non-uniformity of production of some microcytic RBCs as well as normocytic ones.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;RDW is low or low-normal in
thalassemia, since defective hemoglobin chain production results in RBCs that are more uniformly small.</div>

<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnosis is juvenile
rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). This condition is hugely HY for 2CK peds in particular.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Anemia of chronic
disease (AoCD) shows up a lot in JRA Qs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;It is very important I
explicate that whilst AoCD is classically described as being normal MCV, I have seen at least two 2CK peds NBME Qs where
MCV is down. The biggest piece of value I can provide you regarding AoCD is that MCV can absolutely be down. Do not exclude
the diagnosis because
the MCV is low.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Patients do not have iron
deficiency. This is why ferritin is normal. Recall that we said ferritin is the most sensitive indicator of iron status.
Inflammation merely results in lesser ability to incorporate iron into heme, so thereâs less iron that ends up in the blood, essentially.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Serum transferrin is low
because it is suppressed by the inflammatory process. Transferrin saturation can be low-normal, normal, or high. This
is why I didnât make transferrin <i>saturation
</i>an arrow. I have seen NBME Qs
where the diagnosis is AoCD and the transferrin saturation is on the lower end
of normal.</div>

that youâre able to look at a vignette where a patient has an autoimmune disease (e.g., SLE, RA, IBD, etc.),

<div>-Arterial O2 content
= oxygen dissolved in the blood (pO2) + oxygen bound to hemoglobin (Hb-O2).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-The pathway for oxygen
entering the body is: Inhaled
into lungs â moves through
capillary walls of alveoli
â dissolves in blood as pO2 â hops onto hemoglobin as Hb-O2.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;In iron deficiency anemia,
there is simply low hemoglobin. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the ability
of the lungs to conduct
gas exchange, so arterial pO2 is normal.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Since pO2 is normal, the
dissolved oxygen hops onto the available hemoglobin, so hemoglobin saturation is normal. Just because
hemoglobin is low due to anemia doesnât mean there is any impairment in the ability
of hemoglobin to bind oxygen.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Since we have less hemoglobin, even though hemoglobin saturation is normal,
the total quantity
of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is therefore decreased. This is why arterial oxygen
content is low.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Some students might say,
âWell if we have the same oxygen making its way into the blood but we have less hemoglobin, wouldnât the
available hemoglobin have increased saturation then?â â hemoglobin saturation is not increased because Hb is
already maximally saturated in the absence of
anemia in healthy

<div>-&nbsp;Some conditions can present with either conjugated or unconjugated (i.e.,

this with cholelithiasis, which is a stone in the gall bladder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One of the vignettes USMLE
will give is someone with recent cholecystectomy. The implication is there may have been a retained stone in
the cystic duct that descended into the common bile duct post-operatively. The question
need not mention
intraoperative cholangiography was not performed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Because we have a post-hepatic biliary obstruction, direct bilirubin is high.</div>

<div>-&nbsp; Since less bilirubin can
make its way into the small bowel, and then ultimately into the stool, stools can be pale or whiteish
in appearance (known
as acholic stools).</div>
<div>-&nbsp;The direct bilirubin, since it is water-soluble, can make its way into the urine (dark urine).</div>

<div>-&nbsp;In G6PD deficiency, there is less NADPH production, so RBCs are more prone to oxidative stress.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Since we have increased
RBC breakdown and turnover, more indirect bilirubin
will be produced, thereby also increasing total
bilirubin.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Direct bilirubin may be
normal or slightly increased. The liver has a high capacity to handle increased indirect bilirubin arriving for uptake.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Glycogen phosphorylase <i>breaks down </i>glycogen. Glycogen synthase
builds it up. In the fed state, weâd have glycogenesis, not glycogenolysis, so glycogen phosphorylase would be decreased in activity.</div>
<div>-Glucokinase is the
hexokinase variant in the liver. This is the first enzyme of glycolysis. In the
fed state, we have increased glycolysis, so glucokinase is up.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;PEP carboxykinase is a
gluconeogenic enzyme that converts oxaloacetate to PEP, so that PEP can make its way back up to glucose. Donât
worry about the pathway stuff here. All I want you to know is: PEP carboxykinase activity
is down if weâre fed, and itâs up if weâre fasting
and want to make glucose.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Pyruvate carboxylase is a
gluconeogenic enzyme that converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate, so that oxaloacetate, via PEP carboxykinase, can
go back to PEP, and ultimately up to glucose. Once again, donât worry about the pathway

carboxylase is down in the fed state and up in the fasting state.</div>"

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-&nbsp;Glycogen synthase is up because
we have glycogenesis in the fed state (so far not hard).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Normally in glycolysis,
fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) is converted to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6- BP) via PFK-1, the rate-limiting enzyme of
glycolysis. However, some F6P can be shunted into a side pathway, via PFK-2, into F-2,6-BP. The latter is a positive
allosteric regulator of PFK-1, thereby driving
glycolysis forward. Once again, donât freak out. What I want you to know is simply
this:</div>
<div><ul><li>Are we fed? Yes. Okay, F-2,6-BP production and PFK2 activity
are up.</li><li>&nbsp; No, weâre fasting.
Okay, F-2,6-BP production and PFK2 activity

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Glucose-6-phosphatase is a
gluconeogenic enzyme that converts glucose-6-phosphate in the liver back into glucose (deficient in von
Gierke disease). We would expect gluconeogenesis to be decreased in the fed state.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Pyruvate dehydrogenase
converts pyruvate (last molecule in glycolysis) into acetyl-CoA for entrance into the TCA cycle. Activity is
increased in the fed state. Do not confuse this with pyruvate carboxylase, which is a gluconeogenic
enzyme that converts pyruvate into oxaloacetate, so that oxaloacetate can be ultimately sent back to glucose.</div>"

<div><b>ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.</b></div>
<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-The patient has DKA. Insulin
is deficient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-Insulin normally upregulates
GLUT-4, which allows glucose to enter cells. If insulin is low, GLUT-4 expression is low.</div>
<div>-Since insulin is low and
cells are unable to uptake glucose as efficiently, energy must be produced in other
ways. Lipolysis, glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis are all increased.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Insulin upregulates glucokinase in the liver. Since insulin
is low in DKA, glucokinase activity is also low.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;USMLE wants you to know
insulin increases activity of MAP tyrosine kinases and serine-threonine kinases. If insulin is deficient, activity
is reduced for both of these.</div>
When proteins are broken down within the cell, they can be tagged with ubiquitin in order to be sent to
the proteasome. Insulin is anabolic and increases protein synthesis, not
breakdown. If insulin is low, weâd
get more protein breakdown in order to liberate free amino acids for energy.
Therefore, low insulin means more ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis.<br>"
"<div>A researcher is comparing glucokinase from a liver cell with

terms of glucose processing, what is the Km and Vmax (i.e., â or â) of glucokinase compared to hexokinase?</div>"	"<h2><span style=""font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">-</span>Glucokinase has <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">â</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>Km and <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">â</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span>Vmax

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-â Km = lower affinity; â Km = higher affinity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;â Vmax = higher capacity; â Vmax = lower capacity.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-In other words, glucokinase has both lower affinity and greater capacity
for glucose than hexokinase.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Hexokinase
is expressed by cells throughout the body. Glucokinase is predominantly just the liver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;The reason glucokinase has
lower affinity for glucose is because we donât want the liver taking up glucose when blood levels are low. Weâd
want cells throughout the body to preferentially get that glucose for energy utilization. If the
liver takes it up, it will store it as glycogen. We donât want that unless
levels are high, so itâs good that glucokinase doesnât
bind glucose as easily as hexokinase.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But when glucose is high
(meaning insulin goes up), we now want the liver to buffer out some of that glucose and convert it to glycogen for
storage, so glucokinase gets activated by insulin. The liver converts glucose into glucose-6-phosphate
(G6P), via glucokinase. G6P can then be converted to G1P in order to be polymerized into glycogen via glycogen synthase.</div>
<div>- In addition, we need glucokinase
to be able to process large amounts of glucose because itâs specifically activated when blood levels
are high. So the capacity of glucokinase for glucose is greater than hexokinase.</div>"

<div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>-&nbsp;Amenorrhea
seen in anorexia is an important concept
for USMLE.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Leptin is a protein
that causes the feeling of satiety. In low BMI state, leptin
is low. However, leptin is also required
for normal GnRH pulsatility and secretion. This means GnRH is low in anorexia.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Low GnRH causes
a reduction in both LH and FSH.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;The low GnRH seen in anorexia
leading to amenorrhea is sometimes referred
to as hypogonadotropic amenorrhea,
or central amenorrhea. Sometimes the USMLE will give you a Q with anorexia and amenorrhea, and the answer
is just simply,
âdecreased secretion of gonadotropins.â</div>
<div>-&nbsp;LH stimulates the theca interna
cells in the ovaries to make androgens, which are low in anorexia.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp; FSH stimulates the granulosa cells to secrete
aromatase and inhibin
B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Low FSH therefore means not only is inhibin
B low, but aromatase is also low, leading to decreased estrogens in amenorrhea.</div>
<div>-Estrogen is also produced by aromatase from adipose tissue,
which is reduced
in anorexia.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp;Since estrogen and inhibin B
ordinarily induce negative feedback at the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, and in anorexia they are both
low, we should theoretically see an increase in GnRH, LH, and FSH. However, the problem with anorexia
is central, meaning low GnRH is the source of the problem, so it will not go up in response to reduced negative
feedback from estrogen
and inhibin.</div>

deficiency (chronic granulomatous disease); nitroblue tetrazolium assay now obsolete and is the wrong answer on
one of the Step 1 NBMEs (dihydrorhodamine test being correct); NADPH oxidase required as initial enzyme in order to
ultimately generate sufficient H2O2 to overwhelm
catalase (+) organisms; even though the latter generate catalase, which breaks
down H2O2, healthy
individuals produce enough H2O2 via respiratory burst pathway to outpower these pathogens. Molecular oxygen (O2) is the
substrate of NADPH oxidase; should be noted that myeloperoxidase deficiency leading to insufficient generation of
halide-hydroxyl radicals (bleach; hypochlorous
acid) is equally HY on NBME yet underemphasized in other resources. NADPH is a reducing

in p53 protein abnormality).</div>
<div><ul><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Pleiotropy </b>refers to unrelated phenotypes resulting from a
mutation in a single gene. A HY USMLE
example is unrelated types of cancers in family members with Li-Fraumeni
syndrome. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is another HY example (i.e.,
mutation can result in partial albinism and mental retardation, which are
unrelated phenotypic traits). Pleiotropy need not refer to different
traits phenotypically expressed in the same individual.</li><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Variable expressivity</b>, in contrast, does not specifically refer to the
aspect of multiple, disparate
phenotypes caused by a single gene, but instead refers to differences in <i>disease severity
</i>among individuals with a condition that demonstrates a predictable spectrum
of findings. For instance, NF1 is a
HY example of a condition with both variable expressivity <i>and </i>pleiotropy. One
family member might have more severe disease with cafÃ© au lait spots, pheochromocytoma, neurofibromas, and Lisch
nodules (iris hamartomas), whereas another family
member has milder disease with only axillary/groin freckling; the difference in
<i>disease
severity </i>between family members along the predictable spectrum of
possible features of NF1 refers to
variable expressivity. The pleiotropic aspect refers to mutations in NF1 merely causing
different phenotypes, such as pheochromocytoma versus cafÃ© au lait spots.Conditions
that demonstrate variable expressivity must demonstrate complete (100%) penetrance as part of the definition.</li><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Penetrance </b>refers to the percentage of those with a diseased
genotype who demonstrate the diseased phenotype to any degree. In other words, if 100%
of those with a diseased genotype
express the disease phenotypically in some form, then the disease is said to be completely penetrant (NF1 is an example).
If the diseased genotype does not result in a
disease phenotype in all individuals, then the disease is said to be
incompletely penetrant (BRCA1/2 causing
breast cancer that âskips a generationâ is an example).</li></ul></div>

<div>&nbsp;cytoskeleton; diagnosis is Duchenne (XR); dystrophin protein (<i>DMD </i>gene) is required to connect muscle cell cytoskeleton to extracellular
proteins; pseudohypertrophy results from
fibroadipose tissue deposition; Gower maneuver classic for Duchenne; Duchenne
is caused by frameshift or nonsense mutations, resulting in truncated, non-functional protein; Becker
is less severe</div>

&nbsp;Girl with asthma is administered IV methylprednisolone, resulting in marked clinical improvement;&nbsp;whatâs the mechanism via which this agent resulted in improvement?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;âbinding to
cytoplasmic receptor, translocation to nucleus, and transcriptional
activation of target genesâ; most steroid
hormones bind to intracytoplasmic receptors, as is the case additionally for androgens, estrogens, progestins, glucocorticoids,

&nbsp;Experiment is performed where an agent inhibits histone deacetylase; this drug most likely affects&nbsp;which cellular process?&nbsp;	"<div>transcription; histones are highly compacted
structures of heterochromatic DNA; process of acetylation normally
activates and makes
DNA euchromatic (i.e.,
transcribable); methylation normally silences and makes DNA
heterochromatic (i.e., not transcribable); histone
deacetylase â silencing (i.e., â acetylation) and â heterochromatin.</div>"

point for USMLE is that
acetylation is usually associated with gene activation; methylation is usually associated with gene silencing. Epigenetics
is the study of how gene expression can be modified without changes made to nucleic
acid sequences (i.e., instead through
methylation, acetylation, etc.).</div>"
&nbsp;80M + alcohol dependence + many ecchymoses + few teeth + hemorrhagic macules around hair&nbsp;follicles; what is most likely responsible for his poor wound healing?	"<div>inadequate
hydroxylation of collagen polypeptides; Dx is scurvy (vitamin C
deficiency); vitamin C is necessary for hydroxylation
of proline and lysine residues in developing collagen; perifollicular
hemorrhages are a HY finding
for scurvy; bleeding
around gums, poor wound healing,
and easy bruising
are common.</div>"
&nbsp;30M + palpitations + weight loss + exophthalmos + tremors; Q asks, patientâs presentation is most&nbsp;likely&nbsp;due&nbsp;to&nbsp;hormonal&nbsp;action&nbsp;on&nbsp;which&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;following&nbsp;receptors?	"<div>nuclear/retinoid X binding to DNAâ; thyroid
hormones bind intranuclear.</div>"
A couple who are both healthy have two children with achondroplasia; whatâs the most likely&nbsp;mechanism for this process?	"<div>germline mosaicism; achondroplasia is an AD disorder
but most cases are due to <i>de novo </i>mutations within
one of the spermatogonia or oogonia of the parents
(i.e., a % of germline cells are affected), but the somatic (body) cells
of the parents are completely normal
(i.e., this is <i>not </i>somatic
mosaicism); germline mosaicism is important in explaining how itâs possible for an individual to have an AD
disorder, where 100% of their somatic cells are affected, despite both parents being both
phenotypically and genotypically normal. In contrast, somatic mosaicism is due to a post-fertilization
mitotic error and is the mechanism via which a patient could have a % of somatic
cells normal and a % diseased (e.g.,
a mosaic Turner
or Down patient).</div>"
&nbsp;&nbsp;24F + lost in wilderness for three weeks; Q asks how adipocytes play an important role in maintaining&nbsp;homeostasis	"<div>glucagon activates

"<div>âdecreased transcriptionâ; Dx is Fragile X,
which is due to TNR expansion &gt;200 repeats of CGG; expansion of untranslated
region results in hypermethylation of <i>FMR1 </i>gene and prevents binding
of transcription factors
and RNA polymerase.</div>"
&nbsp;6-month-old boy + jaundice + cataracts + hepatomegaly; urine shows positive reaction to copper&nbsp;reduction test and negative reaction to a test agent that contains glucose oxidase; what enzyme is&nbsp;deficient in this patient?	"<div>&nbsp;galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (classic galactosemia); if the Q mentioned cataracts alone, answer
would be galactokinase deficiency; the galactose disorders appear shortly after birth because lactose in breast
milk (or cowâs milk) is broken down into glucose
and galactose; in contrast, fructose disorders appear later when the child is
started on juice, fruit, honey,
and table sugar,
where sucrose is broken down into glucose

17F + asks about breastfeeding and immunity for her baby; physician explains IgA moves through&nbsp;epithelial cells and is secreted into duct lumina; Q asks which process is best described here;	"<div>&nbsp;transcytosis, which is movement of
substrates from outside one side of the cell, <i>through </i>the interior of
the cell, and then out the other side of the cell; this is in contrast to
exocytosis, which is merely secreting
substrates from inside the cell to the outside; endocytosis is a broad term
referring to the internalization of

3F + tonic-clonic seizure; Q asks, the Tx for this condition mediates its effect via which type of&nbsp;molecular target	"<div>&nbsp;âligand-gated
ion channelsâ; benzos, e.g., diazepam, are used first-line for status epilepticus; they agonize GABAA, which
causes chloride to enter the neuron, hyperpolarizing it. GABA is normally
the ligand that binds to its receptor, activating the chloride
channel.</div>"
2M + bites his fingers and lips + orange-red crystals in his diaper; which enzyme is deficient in this&nbsp;patient?	"<div>&nbsp;hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT); Dx is Lesch-Nyhan syndrome; X-linked recessive; congenital
cause of uric acid overproduction (gout); self-mutilation common; HGPRT is necessary for recycling

codominant inheritance with varying degrees
of severity; homozygous <i>ZZ </i>alleles
cause severe presentation; a1-antitrypsin, despite the name, breaks down elastase in the lungs;
deficiency leads to <i>pan</i>-acinar
emphysema (smoking causes centri-acinar);
elastase also present in the liver, so cirrhosis common; presumption is father

âSynthesis of glycogenâ â clearly anabolic
process and would not be increased in predominance of glucagon.</li><li>&nbsp; âIncreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase activityâ â enzyme is anabolic and converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA,
which is a precursor to fatty acid synthesis; this would not be upregulate in catabolic state; in addition, malonyl-CoA is the allosteric inhibitor of carnitine acyltransferase, meaning that if malonyl-CoA is increased,
oxidation of fatty acids would be decreased, which is clearly
not the case in the catabolic state.<br></li><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
âDecreased ketogenesisâ â we would expect increased, not decreased, ketogenesis in catabolic state. Acetyl-CoAs liberated

What&nbsp;do&nbsp;ACEi/ARB&nbsp;do&nbsp;to&nbsp;filtration&nbsp;fraction?	<div>decrease it.</div>
Student asks, âIf diabetes is most common cause of chronic renal failure, and renal failure is defined&nbsp;as low GFR, why would we give them ACEi or ARB then first-line if those drugs decrease filtration&nbsp;fraction?	"<div>&nbsp;Itâs
paradoxical, yes. Although youâd be decreasing filtration fraction with one of
these drugs, youâd <i>also </i>be decreasing the rate at which
glucose is being filtered across the basement
membrane, thereby slowing
the non-enzymatic glycosylation of the BM + progression of disease.</div>
<div>Patients with end-stage renal disease are generally taken off ACEi/ARB,
however early on these drugs are a mainstay of treatment.</div>"
BUN/Cr ratio in pre-, intra-, vs post-renal failure?	"<div>&nbsp;&gt;20 in pre-; &lt;20 if not pre- â FA for Step 1 had stratified
this out as &lt;15 for intra- and 15-20 for post-, but Iâve seen at least three
2CK NBME/CMS Qs where the diagnosis
was acute tubular necrosis and the BUN/Cr was in the 16s or 17s. So Iâve
learned to just tell students: &gt;20 = pre-;
if &gt;20, you simply know itâs not pre-.<br></div>"
Fractional&nbsp;excretion&nbsp;of&nbsp;sodium&nbsp;(FeNa)&nbsp;in&nbsp;pre-/intra-/post-renal&nbsp;failure?	"<div>need to know itâs &lt;1% in pre-renal;
&gt;1% in intra-/post-renal â the low FeNa in pre-renal is due to the PCTâs attempt
to reabsorb Na (water follows
sodium) in low-volume state (or in FMD, RAS).</div>"
Urine&nbsp;osmolality&nbsp;in&nbsp;pre-/intra-/post-renal&nbsp;failure?	"<div>&nbsp;concentrated (high;
&gt;500 mOsm) in pre-; dilute
(low; &lt;350 mOsm)
in intra-/-post.</div>"
When is pre-renal failure the answer apart from the BUN/Cr &gt;20?	"<div>&nbsp;CHF
classically (decreased renal perfusion);
can also be hypovolemia generally <i>not </i>in
the acute setting; itâs to my observation that if the NBME/CMS Q mentions acute hypovolemia + no other information
(i.e., does not mention BUN or Cr),
the answer is acute tubular necrosis (intra-renal), not pre-renal. Pre-renal
can also be the answer for
contrast-nephropathy; regarding this point, contrast agents can cause either
pre-renal (due to afferent arteriolar
spasm) or intra-renal (direct nephrotoxicity); always give fluids to prevent
(HY). The USMLE Q will sometimes
give a presentation of pre-renal
+ ask the etiology, and the answer
is</div>
âdecreased glomerular filtrationâ (NBME).<br>"

When is intra-renal failure the answer?	"<div>&nbsp;classically acute tubular necrosis (ATN) secondary to episodes of hypoxia at the kidney, usually
due to blood loss (i.e, intra-operative requiring lots of blood, or traumatic exsanguination), or
arrhythmia (i.e., patient had episode of VF and was resuscitated) â vignette will mention one of the above scenarios and
then tell you patient has acute oliguria +/- dark urine.
They do not have to mention BUN, Cr, or muddy brown granular casts for ATN.</div>"
Other&nbsp;causes&nbsp;of&nbsp;intra-renal&nbsp;failure?	"&nbsp;â drugs (i.e., gentamicin); rhabdomyolysis (myoglobin is nephrotoxic); contrast
nephropathy"
Why does acute hypoxia cause acute tubular necrosis?	"<div>&nbsp;proximal convoluted tubules have high concentrations of transporters (namely
Na-K-ATPases) with high oxygen demand; also explains why diffuse cortical necrosis
is classically associated with obstetric catastrophes.</div>"
Lab animal is given 100% nitrogen in dumb experiment; most likely part of the kidney to experience anoxic injury (they list everything	<div>âproximal tubule.â</div>
Classic finding in urine with ATN?	"<div>muddy brown granular casts; it should be noted that
general âgranular castsâ <b>are not specific to ATN. </b>Thereâs an IM
CMS Q with an elderly woman who has CVA tenderness + granular casts

is pyelo not ATN.</div>"
USMLE Q gives guy who has MI requiring resuscitation + subsequent oliguria; then they ask what you&nbsp;see on microscopic examination of the kidney	"<div>&nbsp;âdegenerating epithelial cells and dirty brown granular castsâ
or ânecrosis of epithelial cells in proximal
convoluted tubules.â</div>"
Electrolyte disturbance in ATN?	"<div>&nbsp;first week is oliguric phase (hyperkalemia due to decreased filtration); weeks 2-3 are polyuric phase
(hypokalemia due to increased kaliuresis from PCT cells not being able to reabsorb K yet) â btw, kaliuresis means urination of K (great word if you want
to feel sophisticated).</div>"
When&nbsp;is&nbsp;post-renal&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer?	"<div>classically BPH or distal
obstruction secondary to strictures or malignancy.</div>"
&nbsp;How&nbsp;does&nbsp;USMLE&nbsp;like&nbsp;to&nbsp;assess&nbsp;post-renal?	"<div>classically will give you BPH + show you a pic of</div>
<div>hydronephrosis (massively dilated kidney), then theyâll ask the most likely cause of this patientâs condition;
answer = âincreased Bowman capsule hydrostatic pressure,â or âincreased tubular hydrostatic pressure.â This answer
is on several NBMEs.</div>"
BPH&nbsp;Tx?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;alpha-1 blocker (e.g.,

What is analgesic nephropathy?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;renal damage due to NSAIDs â can be renal papillary necrosis, interstitial nephritis, or generalized edema from reduced
renal blood flow. If renal papillary necrosis,
will present with dark urine from ischemia. If interstitial nephritis,
will present with eosinophils in urine as described previously (patient may not necessarily have a rash).</div>"
80F + taking high doses of naproxen for 6 weeks for osteoarthritis + peripheral edema; mechanism of&nbsp;the edema?	"<div>&nbsp;USMLE has
some sort of obsession with naproxen. OA should be treated with acetaminophen before NSAIDs, but patients
will often erroneously / unknowingly self-medicate with high doses of NSAIDs to relieve pain (seen on FM shelves).
Mechanism for edema â USMLE answer = âincreased renal retention of sodium,â or âdecreased renal
excretion of sodium.â</div>"
Why would analgesic nephropathy cause increased renal retention of sodium?&nbsp;	"<div>NSAID knocks out COX â decreased prostaglandin synthesis â decreased diameter of afferent arterioles â decreased renal blood flow â PCT attempts to increase water reabsorption to compensate for
perceived low volume status â PCT accomplishes this by increasing Na reabsorption â water follows sodium â fluid retention
+ edema. This mechanism is HY particularly on FM shelves.</div>"
Patient with analgesic nephropathy; USMLE Q asks mechanism in terms of NSAIDâs ability to inhibit&nbsp;constriction/dilation at afferent vs efferent arterioles	"<div>âvasodilating prostaglandins at afferent
arterioleâ (i.e., NSAID inhibits this).</div>"
When is renal papillary necrosis the answer?	"<div>&nbsp;classically in sickle cell; can also from drugs like NSAIDs;
urine will be dark â renal papillae
in the medulla receive less blood flow, so small changes in the
microvascular supply can lead to sloughing + necrosis of the medulla. Youâll be
able to contrast this disorder from
diffuse cortical necrosis and acute tubular necrosis because the latter two conditions, in the context
of ischemia, are associated with massive, acute events.</div>"

&nbsp;Who gets calcium oxalate stones?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;â classically those with intestinal malabsorptive
disorders such as Crohn, Celiac,
CF â malabsorption of fats means increased intraintestinal binding of fat to calcium
â less
calcium available to bind oxalate intraluminally â more
oxalate is absorbed through intestinal wall.
CaOxalate stones can also be seen in ethylene glycol (AntiFreeze) poisoning and hypervitaminosis C.</div>"
Who&nbsp;gets&nbsp;struvite&nbsp;stones?	"<div>â UTIs caused

What do I need to know about renal tubular acidosis type IV (RTA IV)?	"<div>â either
hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism or
aldosterone insensitivity at the kidney (urine pH &lt;5.5) â patient will present with
lab values resembling Addison disease, but the etiology will be chronic renal

&nbsp;Explain RAAS system.	"<div>reduced renal perfusion (low blood volume, renal artery
stenosis, fibromuscular dysplasia) â juxtaglomerular cells secrete renin â renin cleaves angiotensinogen (produced by liver) in the plasma into angiotensin I â AT I goes to lung where itâs cleaved by ACE into AT II â AT II causes vasoconstriction in systemic arterioles + at the efferent arterioles of the kidney;
it also goes to the zona
glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex, where it upregulates aldosterone synthase, thereby
converting 11-deoxycorticosterone into aldosterone.</div>"
Where&nbsp;does&nbsp;aldosterone&nbsp;act&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;kidney?	"<div>&nbsp;cortical collecting duct; binds to intracytosolic receptor,
causing upregulation of basolateral Na/K-ATPase pumps (1, 2, 3 â for every 1 ATP utilized, 2 K secreted into tubular cell from blood; 3 Na reabsorbed from
tubular cell into blood) â this causes decreased
intra-tubular cell Na â creates a favorable high-low gradient from urine into
the tubular cell â ENaC is upregulated secondarily on apical membrane to allow
Na to move from urine into tubular cell.</div>"
Another important point about renin secretion?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;USMLE wants you to know that beta-1 activity causes renin release. Sometimes youâll get

&nbsp;What&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;JGA?&nbsp;	<div>&nbsp;juxtaglomerular apparatus contains JGC that secrete renin.</div>
What&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;macula&nbsp;densa?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;â modified smooth muscle cells of the DCT that sense changes
in serum sodium, thereby triggering the JGC to
secrete renin; if volume status is low, PCT is attempting to reabsorb more water to compensate; in
order to do so, it reabsorbs more Na, where water follows Na. This means that more distally, less
sodium will still be left in the urine. The macula densa will sense that as a signal that the PCT is
reabsorbing it because the patient is fluid deficient â triggers JGA to secrete renin.</div>"
What do I need to know about mannitol?	"<div>â osmotic diuretic that acts by retaining water within

contraction alkalosis (RAAS kicks up and
secretes protons distally when volume status is low because of the Loop); also
causes increased urinary calcium and
magnesium; classically ototoxic, especially when combined with aminoglycosides like gentamicin; furosemide is a sulfa
drug, so patients with sulfa allergy can go on ethacrynic acid instead
(not a low-yield drug; memorize
that). Bumetanide is an alternative to furosemide in some patients. In general, be aware that loop
diuretics are the most effective fluid-unloaders of all of the diuretics</div></div>"

What do I need to know about spironolactone?	"<div>â aldosterone receptor antagonist used in heart failure after the patient is already on
ACEi (or ARB) and a beta-blocker. Can also be used in patients with Conn syndrome

spironolactone as the answer in patients who are already on
furosemide who need another diuretic (furosemide fluid-unloads the best but causes potassium wasting, whereas
spironolactone is potassium-sparing, so adding the latter on top of furosemide can limit potassium
losses). Also very HY to know that spironolactone causes gynecomastia due to its anti-androgenic effects. Eplerenone is
an alternative to spironolactone that carries
much lower risk of gynecomastia. These drugs decrease mortality in heart
failure (HY; in contrast to furosemide, which does not decrease mortality and is used for symptoms

Student then asks, âI donât get it though. If vitamin D deficiency is associated with decreased Ca + decreased PO4, and
thereâs vitamin D deficiency in chronic
renal failure, why are the electrolytes in the CRF decreased Ca + increased
PO4?â â answer is:
the renal disease always wins; yes, thereâs decreased PO4 absorption in the

this: in INO, the side that cannot adduct is the side of the pathology, so we

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mechanism for pathology: when you look to one side (letâs say
the right), CN VI on the right and CN III on the left are activated. This
unison of activation is accomplished when the left MLF is activated. In the
case of MLF syndrome, the right eye can abduct without a problem, but the left
eye will fail to adduct and the right eye will exhibit nystagmus back toward
the midline. <b>MLF syndrome is
pathognomonic for multiple sclerosis.</b> MS patients can also get optic

vs rotator cuff tendonitis"	"<div>-&nbsp; In NBME
vignettes, Iâve seen both can give Hx of patient doing frequent overhead
movement (i.e., painting a fence) + pain with palpation + pain thatâs worse when lying on oneâs shoulder
in bed at night, making
differentiating these difficult.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subacromial
bursitis will only present with above findings,
which collectively are known as impingement syndrome.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;
Rotator cuff tendonitis will present with weakness when performing exam</div>
maneuvers (as described
in prior table).<br>"
Biceps tendonitis	"Presents as anterior shoulder
pain with focal
tenderness over the biceps tendon (i.e., when pressing on anterior
shoulder)."
Adhesive capsulitis	"<div>-&nbsp; Aka âfrozen
shoulder,â or arthrofibrosis.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Decreased passive
and active motion
of shoulder in all directions.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;
Idiopathic,
but increased risk in diabetes.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;
Tx = range of motion exercises / physiotherapy.</div>
This is a Dx that is LY on Step 1, but for whatever
reason, becomes HY on 2CK.<br>"
Axillary	"<div>-&nbsp;
Main innervation of the deltoid,
allowing for abduction
of arm 15-90 degrees. USMLE
wants you to know deltoid inserts onto the clavicle and axillary nerve
innervating it is at C5/C6.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Palsy caused
by <b>surgical neck of humerus fracture.</b></div>
USMLE vignette will often say âflattened deltoidâ
or âloss of sensation over lateral
upper arm / deltoid.â<br>"
Median	"<div>-&nbsp;
Main innervation is lateral â3 and a halfâ fingers
/ thenar pad, and lateral
forearm.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Does thumb abduction. (In contrast, ulnar nerve does thumb adduction)</div>
<div>-&nbsp; NBME wants âpalmar cutaneous
branch of median nerveâ as answer for sensation
over thenar region.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Palsy caused
by <b>supracondylar fracture of humerus</b>, or â<b>distal shaft fracture.â</b></div>
<div>Former is buzzy;
latter sounds non-specific, but Iâve seen it this way on NBME.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Entrapment
of median nerve causes carpal tunnel syndrome; will present as
paresthesia/numbness of lateral hand / thenar region; can be caused by
hypothyroidism (GAG deposition), acromegaly (growth of tendons), and pregnancy
(edema); can occur bilaterally in construction workers using jackhammer.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Tx for
carpal tunnel ultra-HY on 2CK FM forms. âUse of wrist pad when using computerâ is answer on new 2CK NBME. If not listed,
âwrist splintâ is answer on FM
form. If vignette says wrist splint fails, NSAIDs are wrong answer and not
proven.</div>
<div>USMLE wants âtriamcinolone injection into carpal tunnelâ (not IV steroids)
as next answer. Surgery is
always wrong answer for carpal tunnel on USMLE.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;
2CK wants âelectrophysiological testingâ
and âelectromyography and nerve</div>
conduction studiesâ as next best step in diagnosis for carpal tunnel.<br>"
Ulnar	"<div>-&nbsp; Main innervation of medial â1 and a halfâ fingers,
and medial forearm.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Ulnar nerve also does <b>finger abduction and adduction </b>(i.e., interosseous muscles).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; USMLE loves <b>Froment
sign </b>for ulnar
nerve injury, which
is inability to pinch a piece
of paper between the thumb and index finger (ulnar nerve needed for thumb
adduction against index finger, despite thumb being most lateral digit).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Distal compression (i.e.,
of wrist and hand only,
not forearm) is aka <b>Guyon canal syndrome </b>and is caused
by <b>hook of hamate
fracture; </b>this can sometimes be seen
in cyclists due to handlebar
compression; presents as paresthesias / numbness of 4th and 5th fingers +
hypothenar eminence.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Proximal
compression (i.e., medial forearm + wrist/hand) is aka <b>cubital tunnel syndrome </b>and is one of the most underrated diagnoses
on USMLE, since its yieldness, especially on 2CK, is comparable to carpal tunnel syndrome, but students
often havenât heard of it. Essentially, patient will get paresthesias of medial forearm + hand, where it âsounds like
carpal tunnel but on the ulnar side insteadâ</div>
<div>â&nbsp;
answer = cubital
tunnel syndrome.</div>
<div>- Tx for cubital tunnel
syndrome is âovernight elbow splint.â Surgery
is wrong</div>
answer on USMLE<br>"

<div>-&nbsp; Palsy occurs
as a result of <b>midshaft fracture

of fracture at the <b>radial groove </b>(latter
is obvious).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Retired Step 1 NBME Q says construction worker sustains
âcomminuted spiral fracture of humerusâ
(unusual, since spiral fracture classically = child abuse),

extended periods of time.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Can cause âneurogenic claudication,â where the vignette

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&nbsp; The answer on USMLE if they mention <b>radiculopathy </b>(i.e., shooting pain down a
leg) after lifting a heavy weight or bending over (e.g., while gardening). They
can write the answer as âherniated nucleus pulposus.â</div>
<div>-&nbsp; As I mentioned with the radiculopathies above, be aware
of the L4, L5, and S1
differences.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Be aware
that cervical disc herniation âis a thing,â
meaning itâs possible
and also assessed on USMLE.
2CK neuro forms ask this a couple times, where patient has shooting pain down
an arm, and answer is âC8 disc herniation.â</div>
<div>-&nbsp; If suspected, next best in management = spinal x-ray,
followed by MRI as best /
confirmatory. X-ray will not detect the disc herniation, but it is cheap, fast,
and important to do to rule out other DDx such as infections, tumors, and
abnormal vertebral alignments. If x-ray not listed, or if they ask âwhat is
most likely to determine diagnosis,â answer
= MRI. Be vigilant for how they word the question.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Straight-leg raise

is a <b>negative </b>test. The test is only
positive when they say it reproduces <b>radiculopathy/radiating

The spinal cord ends at L1-L2. The terminal cone of the spinal cord is the conus medullaris.</div>

cord and run inferior to it are the cauda equina.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Resources make these
conditions way more complicated than they need to be. For USMLE, all they really care about is: both conditions can cause urinary
retention and pain in the legs;
conus medullaris syndrome is sudden-onset (think cone is âsharpâ) and causes
perianal anesthesia; cauda equina syndrome is gradual-onset and causes saddle
anesthesia. If you look these conditions up online, youâll
see numerous differences listed side by side. Waste
of time for USMLE.</div>

<div>-&nbsp; OA is <b>non-</b>inflammatory and also known
as degenerative joint
disease.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Since it is <b>non-</b>inflammatory, WBCs
in joint aspirates will be low (i.e., &lt;10k/mL). In addition, patient will not have elevated ESR.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Hip, knee,
and hand findings are usually <b>asymmetric </b>(e.g., âasymmetric joint space narrowingâ). This is in contrast
  to RA, which is usually symmetric. This pattern isnât mandatory, but you
  should still commit the general association to memory.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; âEburnationâ is a term
that refers to the ivory-like appearance of bone
in OA at sites of cartilage erosion.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; HY causes are
<b>obesity, </b>being big and
tall, or lifting heavy weight on the legs
over many years. Patient is usually, but not always, over 40-50. In
  contrast, RA starts younger (20s-30s).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Highest yield
point to know
is that <b>weight loss
</b>is the number-one way to prevent and treat OA.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Apart from
weight loss, <b>acetaminophen </b>is
correct before NSAIDs, since OA is non-
  inflammatory, so NSAIDs wonât do any better + NSAIDs kill the kidneys.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Steroids (both oral and intra-articular) are wrong fucking
answer for OA. OA, once again is non-inflammatory. Steroids
  have no role.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Injection of glycosaminoglycans and use of capsaicin cream
are also wrong answers on USMLE.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Iâd
  guess 80% of NBME vignettes for OA are a patient over age 40-50 with very
  high BMI (&gt;40). There is Q on 2CK NBME form where
Dx is OA in young
woman (32; unusually young),

<div>-&nbsp; In contrast to OA, RA is <b>inflammatory, </b>where joint aspirate will
show generally</div>
<div>&gt;20-50k WBCs/mL. USMLE doesnât give a fuck about exact
numbers (i.e., âwhat about 10-20k?â). You should just
  be aware, more or less, that &lt;10k/mL is non- inflammatory for OA, but &gt;20k
  is where we say, âOk, thereâs something inflammatory here.â ESR will also be
  high if they list it.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; In contrast to OA, RA is <b>symmetric. </b>As I mentioned up above, the association of symmetry for
RA versus asymmetry for OA isnât
a 100% mandatory finding, but you should be aware of that general
  distinction.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; âPannusâ is a term
that refers to growth of new bone within joints
in RA.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Most
  RA vignettes will be a woman 20s-40s. NBME exams like to mention other
  autoimmune diseases in either the patient or family member
(i.e., brother has IBD,
  or sister has SLE, or patient has T1DM), since âautoimmune diseases go
  together.â The HLA associations are <b>not
  </b>strict. Do not pigeon-hole that stuff.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; If USMLE
vignette sounds like RA, they want âarthrocentesisâ as first step in
  diagnosis. They wonât force you to choose between this and antibodies.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; For antibodies, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) <b>is more specific </b>than rheumatoid factor. Both should be ordered for RA.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Tx for
RA is HY.
Two arms of management: 1) symptoms; 2) disease progression. For symptoms, give NSAIDs
  first, followed by steroids. These do <b>not
  </b>slow disease progression. NSAIDs and steroids are for symptoms only. For disease
progression, we use disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
  which slow disease progression. Methotrexate is given first, followed by
  adding an anti-TNF-a agent (i.e., infliximab,
  adalimumab, or etanercept).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Rheumatoid arthritis can cause pulmonary fibrosis / restrictive lung disease. This is called rheumatoid lung. At the
  same time, methotrexate can <i>also </i>cause
  pulmonary fibrosis. So restrictive lung disease in RA patients is often a mix
  of rheumatoid lung and methotrexate-induced pulmonary fibrosis.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; RA can cause serous
pericarditis (friction rub),
as can other
autoimmune diseases, such as
  SLE.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Low hemoglobin in RA = anemia of chronic disease; obviously this could
be for any autoimmune disease, but this shows
  up a lot in RA NBME vignettes.</div>

Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis	"<div>-&nbsp; 2CK Peds forms love JRA. It will sound like regular
RA but just in a kid.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; USMLE
will structure these Qs where they want you to pick between JRA and septic arthritis

has a low-grade fever and a warm, red, painful knee (sounds like SA), but then
they say heâs had similar <b>episodes </b>in
the past (i.e., they want JRA over SA). This is because SA is usually
a one-off event;
for JRA, however, the vignette will say âintermittentâ or âepisodic.â
Low-grade fever can occur in autoimmune flares (not limited to JRA; HY for
sarcoidosis as well).</div>

After PTH binds to the osteo<b>blast, </b>it will express RANK-ligand (RANK-L) on its cell surface.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;

on osteoclasts, which
in turn resorb
(break down) the bone.</div>"
"âWhat do I need to know about OPG in relation
to RANK-L. Can you quickly
clarify.â"	"Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is protective of bone loss. It is a RANK receptor decoy (i.e., it looks 
like RANK receptor), and therefore acts as an endogenous competitive inhibitor of RANK-L.
o In other words, if more OPG is present, then RANK-L will bind to OPG instead of RANK 
receptor, thereby resulting in less osteoclast activation and less bone resorption.
o OPG is suppressed by cytokines (namely IL-1). Therefore, too much cytokine activity can 
cause osteoporosis. In fact, IL-1 is also known as osteoclast-activating factor.
o Estrogen suppresses cytokine activity (IL-1) on bone, resulting in an increased OPG/RANK-L 
ratio and lower risk of bone resorption. In post-menopausal state, â&nbsp;estrogen ââ&nbsp;suppression of IL-1 on bone â&nbsp;âOPG/RANK-L ratio â&nbsp;âÂ­ bone resorption Ã  osteoporosis."

straight up.<br><div>- Low/low-normal BMI causing osteoporosis is HY; 2CK NBMEs have a couple

<div>-&nbsp; In both rickets and osteomalacia, patient
will have âincreased unmineralized osteoid,â or âdeficient mineralization of osteoid.â</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Important cause

can cause jaw claudication (pain in the jaw during
episodes). In contrast to temporomandibular joint dysfunction (a
separate diagnosis), jaw claudication will not be precipitated by eating.</div>

No specific diagnostic test; diagnosis is made clinically.</div>
Tx = steroids.
NSAIDs are wrong answer and are not proven to be effective.<br>"
Polymyositis / Dermatomyositis	"<div>-&nbsp; Usually patient over 50 with proximal muscle pain and stiffness. These findings
are <b>not </b>unique to PMR. The USMLE
will happily give pain and stiffness in polymyositis vignettes.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Key distinction between polymyositis and PMR is that polymyositis will present with <b>1) muscle weakness on physical exam, and/or
2) increased serum CK.</b></div>
<div>-&nbsp; The
muscle weakness *must be on physical exam.* If the patient complains of
âweaknessâ but there is no physical exam findings mentioned in vignette or
physical exam shows 5/5 strength,
thereâs no weakness.
Patients will sometimes mention âweakness,â even though
they really just have pain and/or stiffness.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; If
polymyositis presents with skin findings, it is called dermatomyositis â i.e.,
Gottron papules (violaceous papules on the knuckles), mechanicsâ hands (rough-
surfaced hands), shawl rash (body rash), heliotrope rash (violaceous eyelids /
periorbital rash; donât confuse with malar rash of SLE).</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Patients often
positive for anti-Jo1
antibodies.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; USMLE
wants âelectromyography and nerve conduction studiesâ as first step in management for polymyositis/dermatomyositis. This is what they ask on 2CK NBME forms. I have not seen them ask
anti-Jo1 antibodies vs EMG+NCS as two separate answer choices. Usually anti-Jo1
antibodies are mentioned in the vignette rather than as the test you need to order.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Muscle biopsy
is confirmatory, showing
CD8+ T cell infiltration. The histo can</div>
be described as âCD8 + T cells and macrophages surrounding muscle fibers.â<br><br><div>For whatever reason,
dermatomyositis can be a paraneoplastic syndrome of ovarian
cancer (shows up on Step 1 NBME).</div>
Tx = steroids.<br>"
Fibromyalgia	"<div>-&nbsp; This is a psych condition, not an actual
muscle disorder, but is often
confused with polymyositis and PMR.</div>
<div>-&nbsp;
Labs will be normal. ESR will not be elevated.
Patient will not have fever.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Will be described as woman 20s-50s
with multiple (and often symmetric) muscle tenderness points.</div>
<div>-&nbsp; Treatment is SSRIs. USMLE can write this as âanti-depressant therapy.â This
confuses students (âBut she doesnât
have depression though.â)
â Right. But</div>
SSRIs are still
anti-depressant medication.<br>"
"Temporomandibular joint
dysfunction"	"<div>-&nbsp;
The answer on USMLE if they give jaw pain that is <b>precipitated by eating.</b></div>

Hypothyroid myopathy	"<div>-&nbsp; Myopathy can occur in both hypo- and hyperthyroidism, yes, but this is

Not to be confused with omphalocele in neonates. An umbilical hernia
is completely covered by
skin. In contrast, an omphalocele is a herniation merely covered by a thin,
translucent layer of peritoneal membrane.
It can be idiopathic, but is often associated
with the Trisomy 13 and 18, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.</div><div><br></div><div><img src=""paste-ac3bfeea4926b7cd50bdf3af15e64c09f4801331.jpg""><br></div>"

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Complement proteins are
acute phase proteins produced by the liver. There are three pathways for complement activation; they
all lead to target cell death via formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), composed of C5b-C9 complement
proteins, or via stimulating opsonization and phagocytosis.<br></div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Three main pathways: classic, alternative, and lectin:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><ul><li>&nbsp; Classic â when complement (C1) binds
to the Fc region of IgM and IgG, it flags the antigen
bound to the Abâs Fab for opsonization and phagocytosis, or cell death via MAC.</li><li>&nbsp; Alternative â triggered by C3b binding
directly to the microbial cell surface.</li><li>&nbsp; Lectin â triggered by mannose-binding lectin
(a type of carbohydrate-binding protein
instrumental in innate
immunity) binding to the microbial
cell surface.<br></li></ul></div>



<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
C3b and IgG are the immune
systemâs two major opsonins (which means they bind to antigen and flag it for phagocytosis).</div>
<div>Â§&nbsp; Do not confuse this with IgM and IgGâs ability to bind
complement. Phagocytes do not have an
Fc receptor for IgM, making IgM a poor opsonin. In other words, whilst IgM and IgG bind complement, it is IgG
and C3b that are the immune systemâs major opsonins.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
C3 goes down in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) and SLE flares.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
C4 goes down in cryoglobulinemia (discussed later).</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
C3a, C4a, and C5a are known
as anaphylatoxins, which can trigger degranulation of mast cells,
causing anaphylaxis.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
C5a is a neutrophilic
chemotactic molecule (as with IL-8, LTB-4, kallikrein, platelet-activating factor,
and bacterial products).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Terminal complement
deficiency (C5-9) is associated with recurrent <i>Neisseria </i>infections (both gonococcal and meningococcal).</div>

C1 esterase inhibitor

Paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria is caused by âincreased complement-mediated lysisâ of RBCs. It is caused by deficiency of

<div>âCan you explain thymus-independent vs thymus-dependent antigens?â</div>	"<div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thymus-independent means an
antigen is <b>not </b>displayed on MHC
molecules. Therefore there is no resultant T cell response.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thymus-dependent means an
antigen <b>is </b>displayed on MHC
molecules. Therefore there is a resultant T cell response.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Antigens need to be
proteinaceous in order to be displayed on MHC molecules and generate a T cell response. In other words, if a
Q asks what kind of molecule could induce a T cell response, choose whatever answer is the protein, even if it
sounds weird (e.g., flagellin, or poly-D-glutamic
acid capsule of <i>C. anthracis</i>). Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or the polysaccharide capsule of <i>H. influenzae </i>type
B, for instance, are wrong,
since they are not protein.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
If an antigen is not
proteinaceous, then it will not be expressed on MHC molecules (i.e., thymus-independent antigen). These
antigens therefore require conjugation to a protein so that a T cell response can be elicited. USMLE wants you to know
that <i>H. influenzae </i>type B, <i>Strep
pneumoniae</i>, <i>N. meningitidis, </i>and
typhoid (<i>Salmonella typhi</i>) are <b>conjugate vaccines </b>that are <b>polysaccharide-based
</b>(on NBME 27 for Step 1) â i.e., the polysaccharide capsule from these organisms is conjugated to a proteinaceous substrate. Toxoid is the wrong</div>
<div>answer for these vaccines.</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Toxoids are vaccines in which an inactivated toxin from an organism, which is proteinaceous, is administered. Diphtheria and tetanus are classic examples.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thymus-independent response
involves an antigen binding to B cell receptor (BCR), followed by the B cell making antibody against the
antigen without phagocytosing + expressing it on MHC II to Th2 cells. This process does not result in any type of
memory cell being produced, so immunity
is short-lived.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
In contrast,
thymus-dependent responses lead to the production of memory cells, so the immunity is longer-lived.</div>"

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Respiratory burst is a
process by which phagocytes such as neutrophils and macrophages can produce
hydrogen peroxidase and hydroxy-halide radicals
(bleach) to kill microbes.<br></div></div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
CGD is caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency â&nbsp;decreased H2O2 production â&nbsp;<b>increased </b><b>susceptibility to catalase-positive organisms</b>.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Catalase is the enzyme that breaks down H2O2.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Humans <b>without </b>CGD:
Production of H2O2 via respiratory burst is &gt;&gt;&gt;
catalase produced by organisms â organisms are overwhelmed + die.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Human <b>with </b>CGD:
Production of H2O2 via respiratory burst is &lt;
catalase produced by organisms â organisms can tolerate phagocyte environment + survive.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Organisms that produce catalase are able to neutralize <i>small amounts </i>of H2O2, but not large amounts. So in a typical person
who does <i>not </i>have
NADPH oxidase deficiency, the amount of hydrogen
peroxide he or she produces far exceeds what catalase (+) organisms can handle, so therefore there's
no innate susceptibility to these organisms.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
A general mnemonic
for catalase-positive organisms
is <b>C SHAPES </b>or <b>SPACESHip:</b></div>

kappa and lambda
are expressed on B cells,</div>

<br>

<div>where the ratio
can be heavily slanted in leukemia/lymphoma. The point of this Q is to 1) be
able to infer the heavy ratio of
kappa/lambda means the pathology is related to this, and 2) to be aware of various T and B cell markers. Should be
noted CD19 is another important B cell marker, and that rituximab is a monoclonal antibody

What will the USMLE frequently say in the Q if theyâre hinting at pulmonary hypertension?&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;HY vignette
descriptors are loud S2 or P2 (pulmonic valve slams shut when the distal

proximal pulmonary arteries; increased pulmonary vascular markings (congestion
+ increased hydrostatic pressure).</div>"
When&nbsp;is&nbsp;âpulmonary&nbsp;hypertensionâ&nbsp;important&nbsp;as&nbsp;the&nbsp;answer?&nbsp;	"<div>
<div>&nbsp;notably in Eisenmenger syndrome
and cor pulmonale.<br></div>
<div><ul><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regarding Eisenmenger: the
reversal of the L to R shunt across the VSD such that itâs R to L requires the tunica media of the pulmonary
arterioles to hypertrophy secondary to chronic
increased preload â proximal
backup of hydrostatic pressure â increased afterload on the right
heart â <i>now </i>the right heart starts to
significantly hypertrophy â shunt across the VSD
reverses R to L. This is important, as RVH is not the most upstream cause of Eisenmenger; the pulmonary hypertension is.</li><li>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Regarding cor pulmonale: as
mentioned above, cor pulmonale is right heart failure secondary to a pathology of pulmonary etiology (e.g., COPD,
cystic fibrosis [CF], fibrosis, etc.);
however it must be noted that the most common cause of right heart failure is
left heart failure; so for cor
pulmonale to be the diagnosis, the left heart <b>must not </b>be the etiology
of the right heart failure; the lungs must be the etiology. If the cause of the
right heart failure is, e.g., COPD or
CF, then it is <b>the degree of hypoxic
vasoconstriction </b>that determines
the prognosis for the cor pulmonale; in the setting of inadequate alveolar ventilation â hypoxic vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels â increased afterload in the</li><li>proximal
pulmonary arteries â dilatation
and congestion of proximal pulmonary arteries â more hydrostatic pressure in the proximal
pulmonary arteries â increased
afterload experienced by the right
heart â right heart
hypertrophies â right
heart eventually decompensates
secondary to chronically elevated pulmonary vascular pressure â classic
right heart failure signs ensue (JVD + pulmonary edema; hepatosplenomegaly
may also be seen [e.g., spleen tip
and/or liver edge are palpable beneath the costal margin]). In other words, the mere findings of pulmonary
hypertension alone are not sufficient for a Dx of cor pulmonale; right heart failure signs must also be seen in the
vignette (one NBME Q makes this
distinction). The pulmonary hypertension need not be due to hypoxic
vasoconstriction if the disease
process is pulmonary fibrosis (CREST syndrome, Hx of radiation to the chest).
It must also be noted that in cor pulmonale,
<b>pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(PCWP) must be normal.</b><br></li></ul></div>

must therefore reflect the pulmonary
capillary pressure (immediately distal to the catheter); but of course the pulmonary capillary
pressure must reflect the left atrial pressure

is a very simple rule that must be memorized

be normal in the setting of cor
pulmonale, but it will also be elevated if <b>cardiogenic

âCan you explain V/Q mismatch?â	"<div>&nbsp;â ventilation (V) relative to perfusion (Q) â physiologic and pathologic
V/Q mismatch exist; should theoretically be one to one; physiologic V/Q
mismatch refers to natural imbalance
of ventilation relative to perfusion in healthy lung when the patient is
upright. <b><i>Both </i></b>ventilation <i>and </i>perfusion increase from apex to
base, but because of the effects of gravity,
perfusion increases <i>more </i>from
apex to base, so V/Q is lower at the bases (~0.6) compared to the apices (~3.0). In terms of pathologic V/Q
mismatch, the overwhelming majority of lung pathologies have decreased V/Q, meaning the net amount of oxygenation of the
alveoli is reduced compared to the
amount of perfusion reaching those areas (i.e., in COPD, CF, asthma). In other
words, even with hypoxic
vasoconstriction in areas with lesser oxygenation (as an attempt to reduce
perfusion to inadequately ventilated
areas and restore V/Q closer to 1/1), the net amount of alveolar ventilation is less compared to perfusion through the
alveoli. In pulmonary embolism, itâs the opposite: V/Q is high because
perfusion is reduced
to areas that receive normal
ventilation.</div>"
What is the difference between shunt and dead space?&nbsp;	"<div>
<div>â a shunt means â V/Q (i.e.,
reduced ventilation relative to
perfusion) <i>to the point that the
patientâs arterial oxygen becomes decompensated </i>(i.e., a shunt is always
pathologic in pulmonary terms), but â V/Q can
also be physiologic (i.e., not a shunt) at the lung bases, where the
V/Q is normally 0.6; dead space means â</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>V/Q (i.e., low perfusion relative
to ventilation), <i>but need not be pathologic </i>(i.e., there is a natural
â</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>V/Q mismatch of ~3.0 at the lung apices.
Types of dead space (asked
on Step 1 NBME):</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Alveolar </i>dead space = natural,
physiologic â V/Q within the alveoli,
where some areas of lung receive more ventilation than perfusion â i.e., the apices (V/Q of ~3.0) compared to the bases (~0.6).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Anatomic </i>dead space refers to parts of the respiratory tree
that are naturally ventilated but do not partake in gas exchange,
such as the trachea, bronchi,
and terminal bronchioles. The respiratory
bronchioles and alveoli partake in gas exchange, so the anatomic V/Q starts to decrease
from the level
of the respiratory bronchioles distal.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Physiologic </i>dead space is the sum of anatomic and alveolar dead space. This reflects the alveolar and respiratory tree dead space seen in healthy individuals.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Pathologic </i>dead space is seen classically in pulmonary embolism
(as well as amniotic fluid, fat, and
air emboli), where blood flow is impeded by an embolus. V/Q will increase in an
area of lung simply because
perfusion is blocked in that area. As you can see, this is quite distinct from physiologic dead space.</div>"
âYeah but Iâm still confused by shunt and dead space. Can you please elaborate a little more.	"<div>
<div>&nbsp;â A shunt means a <i>right to left effect of oxygenation due to insufficient alveolar
ventilation </i>â i.e., a mixing of
deoxygenated blood (right) with oxygenated blood (left) such that a patientâs
net oxygenation is less than what it
should be <i>because some of the alveoli
arenât receiving enough oxygen</i>. This is different
from a R to L cardiac shunt, where deoxygenated blood in the right heart is
literally mixing with oxygenated
blood in the left heart; in a pulmonary R to L shunt, deoxygenated blood from insufficiently oxygenated pulmonary
venules (coming from an area of lung thatâs obstructed, e.g., from a peanut or mucous plugging) mixes
with oxygenated blood from adequately oxygenated pulmonary venules; this effect of deoxygenated blood being <i>averaged in with </i>oxygenated blood creates a âR to Lâ effect; we call this R
to L movement a shunt. This is made more confusing by the existence of L to R cardiovascular
âshunts,â which refer to pathologies such as VSD, ASD, PDA, and AV fistulae, where the patient is not cyanotic/deoxygenated
and has blood moving from the left circulation to the right.
However the term âshunt,â as applied to ventilation and perfusion in</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>pulmonology
(i.e., when we say âwhat is shunt vs dead space?â) refers to a R to L process.
It is not sufficient to merely say a shunt is a R to L process,
period, because pulmonary
embolism (dead space,
not shunt) <i>also </i>ultimately results in deoxygenated blood mixing with oxygenated blood.</div>"
&nbsp;âIâve heard something about oxygen not helping in a pulmonary shunt. No idea what that means&nbsp;though. Can you explain.â&nbsp;	"<div>&nbsp;â A classic
effect of a pulmonary shunt is an inability to effectively raise arterial pO2 even when oxygen is
administered. For instance, if a patient swallows a peanut, the area of lung blocked off could be said to
have a âzeroâ for oxygen (i.e., no ventilation). The result is: that zero
is mixed in with all of the other areas of normal lung â this means <i>the average </i>of
all areas of lung cannot achieve
normal oxygenation because that zero is mixed in, so even if O2 is administered and the remaining alveoli are highly
ventilated and oxygenated, the net result is still an arterial oxygenation that is insufficient. We use
the peanut as an easy example to help visualize this process, but when this is applied to, e.g., COPD or
asthma, what occurs is many tiny alveolar pockets become obstructed, with lots of mini shunts being formed; so we gets
lots of tiny zeros throughout the lungs, where
even if we give oxygen and many alveoli have high pO2, the patientâs <i>arterial </i>pO2 remains low because the net oxygen from all of the
alveoli combined is low. These zeros being mixed in with normal lung reflects
our R to L process
(i.e., the shunt).</div>"
Can&nbsp;you&nbsp;explain&nbsp;A-a&nbsp;gradient?&nbsp;	"<div>
<div>â A is alveolar oxygen; a is arterial oxygen. In settings where the patientâs arterial
oxygen is low, the A-a gradient (normally 5-10 mmHg) tells us whether thereâs a lung pathology impeding
gas exchange or if the patient is merely hypoventilating. In other words, a high A-a gradient means
the patient has low arterial oxygen <i>despite
</i>good alveolar oxygen (i.e.,
something is impeding gas exchange); normal A-a gradient means low arterial
oxygen <i>because of </i>low alveolar oxygen (i.e., the patient merely isnât
breathing enough). The A-a gradient is applied
to the average of all of the alveoli when we talk about a patientâs high versus
normal A-a gradient; in other words,
we donât say an obstructed area of lung has a negative A-a gradient whereas the rest of the lung has a high A-a
gradient. We just look at the patient overall. Probably one of the highest yield points is knowing that <b>opioids, benzos, and barbiturates cause a <i>normal </i>A-a gradient </b>because these agents cause respiratory
depression. That is, if a patient is on fentanyl for pain following
surgery and has a low arterial O2, we know the low arterial O2 is <i>because </i>the
patient isnât</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>breathing
adequately, not because there is defective gas exchange. The question might not
overtly tell you the respiratory rate
is 6/minute; theyâll sometimes say itâs 12 (normal), but the answer is still ânormal A-a gradientâ; adequate depth of
respirations also matters. USMLE also wants you to know that the mechanism for the patientâs hypoxemia in pulmonary
edema is âhigh A-a gradientâ; this makes
sense, as the transudate in the alveolar spaces impedes gas exchange, but the
patientâs ventilation is otherwise
fine. My biggest advice is to not memorize lung pathology in general as synonymous with âhigh A-a gradientâ; as I
mentioned above, USMLE will slam students on normal A-a gradient â e.g., patient being weaned from a ventilator and has pCO2 of 70 mmHg (normal
33-44) â answer = normal
A-a gradient because the patient is merely hypoventilating (low arterial O2 <i>because </i>alveolar O2 is low).</div>"
&nbsp;âCan you explain type I vs type II respiratory failure?	"<div>&nbsp;type I is when the patient has low arterial pO2 <i>and
</i>low arterial pCO2; type II is when pO2 is low and PCO2 is high. The
patientâs arterial pCO2 level
(normally 33-44 mmHg) is the biggest
giveaway of his or her state
of ventilation. If the Q tells you the patientâs pO2 is 70 mmHg (normal is 80-100 mmHg) and the
pCO2 is 55 mmHg, you know right away
the answer is âalveolar hypoventilationâ as the cause of the hypoxemia. For the overwhelming majority of USMLE questions,
if pCO2 is low, it means the respiratory rate is high; if pCO2 is high, it means the respiratory
rate is low (i.e., the relationship is almost always inversely related). It must also be pointed out that
<b>CO2 diffuses quickly while O2 diffuses
slowly. </b>This means the patient
must have healthy lung in order to achieve adequate oxygenation â i.e., high
respiratory rate cannot compensate
for a shunt or pathologic dead space in order to adequately restore arterial pO2 to normal because O2 diffuses too
slowly; however, even in the setting of lung pathology, because CO2 diffuses quickly, insofar as the respiratory rate is
high, CO2 can still get out, which is why it will almost always
be low when respiratory rate is high. I will talk about a notable
exception shortly.</div>"
Yeah&nbsp;but&nbsp;how&nbsp;does&nbsp;this&nbsp;type&nbsp;I&nbsp;vs&nbsp;II&nbsp;respiratory&nbsp;failure&nbsp;stuff apply&nbsp;more&nbsp;specifically&nbsp;to&nbsp;questions?â&nbsp;	"<div>
<div>Highest yield for USMLE is acute asthma attack,
pulmonary embolism, and opioids:<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
For <i>acute </i>asthma, the patient will have a type I respiratory failure: <b>low pO2, low pCO2, normal bicarb, high pH </b>â in this setting, RR is high (e.g., 28/min),
so pCO2 is low, not high, because
the CO2 can diffuse out with no problem; however
O2 is low because the</div>
<div>bronchospasm and secretions prevent
the slow-diffusing O2 from sufficiently entering the</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>capillary
beds; bicarb is unchanged <b>because itâs
the acute setting; </b>it will not normally start to appreciably decrease for at least 12-24 hours (just think,
similarly, it takes at least a day for bicarb
to decrease when one goes to high altitude, resulting in altitude sickness); pH
is high because of acute respiratory alkalosis (once again,
bicarb hasnât decreased
to compensate).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Classic USMLE scenario is
asthma attack after 30-45 minutes, where the patientâs values are as follows: <b>low pO2, normal pCO2, normal bicarb, normal pH; </b>the Q asks what you
should do: answer = intubation â reason being: the low O2 clearly means the patient is still
in respiratory distress, however the
rising of CO2 into the normal range (and restoration of pH to normal) indicates this is only because <i>the patient is getting tired </i>â i.e., RR
is falling out of fatigue, not
because the patientâs O2 has stabilized. In this setting, the patient is <i>in transition to a type II respiratory failure. </i>In other words, if we
donât intubate, the patientâs values will soon
become: <b>low pO2, high pCO2, normal
bicarb, low pH </b>(i.e., respiratory acidosis; type II respiratory failure).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
For pulmonary embolism, we
also have a type I respiratory failure: <b>low
pO2, low pCO2, normal bicarb, high
pH, </b>same as acute asthma. Bicarb is once again unchanged because itâs the acute setting; pCO2 is low because
RR is high; O2 is low because of pathologic dead space (high V/Q â despite good ventilation, reduced perfusion results in
reduced arterial oxygenation).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
For opioids, we expect
hypoventilation, so we have: <b>low pO2,
high pCO2, normal bicarb, low pH </b>(respiratory acidosis; type II respiratory failure),
secondary to the patientâs low RR.</div>"
You said thereâs an exception for CO2 and respiratory rate?â	"<div>
<div>â 9 out of 10 Qs will give you a scenario where the relationship between CO2 and RR is an inverse
one. However there is also this type of Q â <b>57M + COPD + RR 28 (NR
10-14) + pO2 50 mmHg (NR
80-100) + pCO2 80 mmHg (NR
33-</b></div>
<div><b>44) + bicarb 32 mmHg (NR 22-28) +
pH 7.27 (NR 7.35-7.45); </b>Dx? â answer
= âchronic respiratory acidosis and
acute respiratory acidosisâ (acute on chronic, but this is how they word it) â first things first: patients with COPD are chronic CO2 retainers, so if this
guy were <i>not </i>in acute distress here,
weâd expect his baseline values to
be <i>just </i>chronic respiratory acidosis:
low O2 (slightly reduced at 70s mmHg), high CO2 (slightly elevated at 50s mmHg), high bicarb (reflective of chronic respiratory</div>
<div>acidosis, where the elevation in bicarb <i>means </i>the
respiratory acidosis is chronic; if it were acute,</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>bicarb
would be unchanged), and pH normal (chronic respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation; the high bicarb balances the high CO2). So
in the case of the above bold values, we say, âWait, his RR is high though.
How is his CO2 also high? Thatâs
so weird.â Yeah, it is. But apparently in COPD exacerbations, this is common. COPD (chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease) = the combination
of chronic bronchitis and emphysema; regarding the latter, destruction of the
alveolar septa results in decreased
surface area for gas exchange and decreased CO2 diffusion <i>even when the RR is elevated;
</i>the patient is a chronic CO2 retainer <i>because
</i>he or she has decreased surface area for
gas exchange; most COPD exacerbations are due to viral infection,
resulting in inflammation of the bronchi and further decreased
gas exchange. Another HY tangential
point for USMLE is that antibiotics
are always given in COPD exacerbations, even though most cases are viral and
patient is afebrile.</div>"
What do I&nbsp;need to know about FEV1/FVC?&nbsp;	"<div>â normal
ratio is considered &gt;0.7 (according to AAFP); ratio is decreased in obstructive lung disease (&lt;0.7;
&lt;70%); ratio is <i>normal or </i>increased
in restrictive lung disease (&gt;0.7;
&gt;70%); should be noted that in both obstructive and restrictive, FEV1 and
FVC, <i>as
independent variables, </i>both decrease; itâs only the ratio that differs.</div>"
<i>Why&nbsp;</i>is the FEV1/FVC ratio normal or increased in restrictive?	"<div>â typical student response is, âWell FEV1 doesnât go down as much as FVC in restrictive.â But <i>why </i>is this the case? â answer that pops up all over NBME exams is <b>radial traction </b>â i.e., if the restrictive pathology is caused by fibrosis /
scar formation, we could colloquially
say that fibrosis is âsticky,â where it sticks to the outside of the airways and keeps them from closing â the amount of air one breathes out in one second (FEV1) doesnât go down as much as it does
in an obstructive lung disease,
where radial traction doesnât play a role (so FEV1 goes down even more in obstructive pathologies â FEV1/FVC is low in obstructive).</div>"
59F + advanced COPD and lung cancer + requires partial pneumonectomy + FEV1 of left lung is&nbsp;600mL; next best step?	"<div>&nbsp;âmeasurement of FEV1 of the right lungâ â seemingly weird answer but HY for pulm component of surg shelves
â minimum acceptable postoperative FEV1 for both lungs is 800mL.
âOkayâ¦â Yeah, I know. Just memorize it.</div>"
âWhat is obstructive vs restrictive lung disease?â	"<div>
<div>â obstructive lung disease means air-trapping occurs
because there is literally obstruction in the airways,
resulting in prolonged expiratory phase;</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>restrictive means there is decreased ability
for the lungs to expand (decreased compliance) but expiratory component
remains unaffected in pure restrictive pathology.</div>"
What&nbsp;are&nbsp;some&nbsp;common&nbsp;obstructive&nbsp;vs&nbsp;restrictive&nbsp;conditions?	"<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Obstructive:
emphysema + bronchitis (combo = COPD);
asthma.<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
Restrictive: autoimmune
diseases (many conditions can result in fibrosis, such as rheumatoid arthritis [rheumatoid lung], systemic sclerosis
[both diffuse and limited
{CREST}], sarcoidosis); Hx of
radiation to the chest (i.e., Hx of Hodgkin) leading to fibrosis; pneumoconioses (asbestosis, silicosis,
etc.); <b>ankylosing spondylitis; obesity;
neuromuscular disease </b>(i.e., myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barre).</div>"
What&nbsp;is&nbsp;definition&nbsp;of&nbsp;chronic&nbsp;bronchitis?&nbsp;	"<div>â productive cough every day for &gt;3 months in a year for at least two consecutive years;
most common cause
is smoking.</div>"
57M + 4-day Hx of productive cough + COPD managed with ipratropium inhaler + afebrile + HR 110 +&nbsp;RR 22 + BP 130/80 + O2 sats 90% + breath sounds decreased bilaterally + CXR shows hyperinflation of&nbsp;both&nbsp;lungs;&nbsp;Dx?	"<div>= âbronchitisâ â i.e., acute bronchitis; usually
viral.</div>"
&nbsp;Classic way to differentiate COPD from asthma?&nbsp;	"<div>â in asthma, spirometry showing decreased respiratory function is <i>largely reversible </i>with albuterol; this
is modestly effective at best in COPD; âflattened
diaphragmâ is classic CXR descriptor for hyperinflated lungs seen in COPD; this
descriptor can be seen in asthma, but is rare.</div>"
âWhat do I need to know about DLCO?	"<div>â stands for diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (correct, not dioxide); test
measures difference in partial pressures of inspired vs expired carbon monoxide; you just need to know
that DLCO is decreased for most lung pathologies, <b>however it is increased in
asthma; </b>how this applies to questions â if you get
a hard vignette (e.g., COPD vs asthma, etc.) and they tell you DLCO is down, you can say, âOk cool,
itâs not asthma.â</div>"
âWhat&nbsp;do&nbsp;we&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;in&nbsp;terms&nbsp;of&nbsp;lung&nbsp;volumes&nbsp;and&nbsp;flow-loop&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;for&nbsp;obstructive&nbsp;vs&nbsp;restrictive?	"<div>
<div>â in general,
lung volumes are increased in obstructive lung pathologies and decreased in restrictive ones.

If 0-1 point, answer =
âsupportive careâ; or âno treatment necessaryâ; or âwarm saline gargleâ
(same as supportive care); or âacetaminophen.â Latter is answer for 3M with viral

If child is, e.g., 12 years
old, and develops a rash with the beta-lactam, answer = beta-lactam allergy.</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the vignette is of a 16-17 year-old

(there will be no confusion; the USMLE will make it clear),
the answer = EBV mononucleosis; therefore do a

<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is why itâs frequently
misdiagnosed as Strep pharyngitis. It is HY to know that beta- lactams
given to patients
with EBV may cause rash via a hypersensitivity response
to the Abx in the setting of
antibody production to the virus. EBV, in a patient who does not receive Abx, can cause a mild maculopapular rash.
But the rash with beta-lactam + EBV causes a
more intense pruritic response generally 7-10 days following Abx
administration on the extensor surfaces

<div>+ S4. An S4 on the USMLE is often seen in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

donât confuse HCM with HOCM; HOCM is an AD mutation in the beta-myosin

Can you explain âsplitting of S2â?	"<div>
<div>&nbsp;What does that even mean? â the aortic valve normally shuts (A2) just before the pulmonic valve (P2), so A2 will occur slightly
before P2 â when we talk about changes in splitting of the S2 heart sound (i.e.,
wide splitting, paradoxical splitting, etc.), if pressure in a ventricle is greater, the sound will occur
later / is protracted. So if RV pressure becomes greater for whatever
reason â P2 occurs
later â wider splitting. So pulmonary artery
hypertension = wide-</div>
<div>splitting. If LV pressure becomes
greater â A2 occurs
later, and can even occur
after P2 â</div></div>

<div>paradoxical
splitting. So LVH = paradoxical splitting. When R or L ventricular pressure
exceeds the pulmonic arterial and
aortic pressure, respectively, the valves open. Then the ventricle will lose pressure as blood ejects, followed by
isovolumetric relaxation marking the onset of diastole, and the pressure within the ventricle falls
below the pressure distal to the valve â valve
shuts. Normally splitting oscillates
with the respiratory cycle. Inhalation causes P2 to occur later â decrease in intrathoracic pressure â increased
venous return to right atrium â more
blood in right ventricle â more preload â more
pressure â time it takes
for RV pressure to fall below pulmonic arterial pressure is greater
â P2 will occur slightly
later with inhalation. With exhalation itâs the opposite.
P2 occurs slightly sooner
because increased intrathoracic pressure will attenuate venous return â less preload
in RV â less pressure
in RV â time it takes
for RV pressure to fall below pulmonic arterial pressure is less â pulmonic valve
closes slightly sooner
â distance between
A2 and P2 is less.</div>"

</b>â hypoxic vasoconstriction (e.g., in chronic bronchitis, CF) or
obliteration of pulmonary parenchyma (emphysema) will cause a backup of blood and pulmonary HTN â increased afterload on RV â starts the
process of cor pulmonale (mere pulmonary HTN is not cor pulmonale; there must
be RH failure). Can also be due to
fibrosis (e.g., CREST or radiation) + loss of lung parenchyma (emphysema).</div>"
How&nbsp;will&nbsp;USMLE&nbsp;describe&nbsp;pulmonary&nbsp;HTN?&nbsp;	"<div>â increased pulmonary vascular

pleural effusion; can present
with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (PND).</div>"
&nbsp;Is HOCM the same thing as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)?&nbsp;	"<div>â Once again,
no. HOCM is an AD condition (as
discussed earlier). HCM is the <b>diastolic
dysfunction </b>of the LV that ensues secondary to increased LV afterload
(i.e., from systemic
HTN, AS, or HOCM)
â the USMLE will often give you an S4 heart sound for HCM. so in turn, HOCM can
be a cause of HCM, but donât use the terms interchangeably.</div>"
What about restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)?	"<div><b>diastolic
dysfunction </b>with failure of the heart to
expand, in the absence of a thickened LV as seen in HCM; causes are

Can you explain restrictive cardiomyopathy vs constrictive pericarditis?â&nbsp;	"<div>â both are characterized by diastolic dysfunction (decreased ability of heart to expand),
but in RCM this is due to myocardial stiffness

What determines whether a pericardial effusion becomes a tamponade?&nbsp;	"<div>â acuteness
of fluid accumulation â tamponades can be a small volume that accumulates quickly, e.g., from a stab wound or post-MI LV free-wall rupture;

What is pre-ductal vs post-ductal coarctation?&nbsp;	"<div>â if the coarctation occurs proximal to the ductus arteriosus insertion on the descending
aortic arch, itâs called pre-ductal â adequate
blood flow to lower limbs is
therefore dependent on a PDA if the coarctation is severe â <b>if the coarctation is severe, the neonate will become cyanotic a
few days to a week after birth contemporaneous to the ductus arteriosus closure; </b>pre-ductal is also the
answer for the type seen in Turner syndrome; in post-ductal, although blood flow to the lower limbs is impaired
even if a PDA is present, it is usually not
as severe as pre-ductal and therefore yields greater time for adequate
collateral circulation to develop,
leading to rib notching (dilatation of intercostal arteries) and presentation

Statins; mechanism?	"<div>&nbsp;â competitive, reversible inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase â this secondarily causes
upregulation of hepatic LDL receptors â both
mechanisms decrease serum LDL â statins decrease
morality, not because of their LDL-lowering effect (because other drugs do that

&nbsp;55M + good BP + carotid bruit heard on auscultation; next best step in Mx?	"<div>â&nbsp; carotid duplex ultrasound to look for carotid plaques
â in this case, if they are obvious and explicit about the suspected etiology of the stroke, TIA, or
retinal artery occlusion, then you can just do the carotid duplex ultrasound.</div>"
How to Mx carotid plaques?&nbsp;	"<div>
<div>â first we have to ask whether the patient is symptomatic or asymptomatic. A bruit does not count as symptoms
(that's a sign).
Symptomatic means stroke,
TIA, or retinal artery occlusion. According to recent guidelines: carotid
occlusion &gt;70% if symptomatic, or</div>
<div>&gt;80% if asymptomatic â answer
= do carotid endarterectomy. Below these thresholds â answer =
medical management = statin, PLUS clopidogrel OR dipyridamole + aspirin.
The USMLE will actually <i>not </i>be hyper-pedantic about the
occlusion %s (thatâs Qbank). They'll make it obvious for you which answer
they want. They'll
say either 90% â answer certainly
= carotid endarterectomy, or they'll say</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>50%
â answer = medical management only. Thereâs
one NBME Q where they say a guy has a bruit but
is asymptomatic, and has 10 and 30% occlusion in the left vs right carotids,
respectively, and heâs already on
aspirin + statin, and the answer is ""maintain current regimenâ â if he were symptomatic, even with low occlusion, heâd certainly need statin, PLUS clopidogrel OR dipyridamole + aspirin.</div>"
How to Tx AF?	"<div>â we have to consider both arms of management: blood thinning +
treating the actual AF. <b>For blood thinning, CHADS2 score is
standard in terms of evaluating risk </b>(there are variants, but the USMLE won't ever be borderline with
how this plays into a question; they'll either give you a full- blown obvious high-risk patient where all
are positive, or they'll make it clear that the patient is low- risk and merely
just has AF alone).</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
CHADS2 = CHF, HTN, Age 75+, Diabetes,
Stroke/TIA (latter is 2 points;
the rest are 1 point).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>If 0 or 1 points, give aspirin </b>(anti-platelet therapy).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>If 2+ points, give warfarin </b>(anti-coagulation
therapy).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
If valvular AF (i.e., AF in someone
with a mitral or aortic valve lesion),
answer = warfarin.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
If non-valvular AF, can give other agents (e.g., dabigatran, apixaban).</div>"
&nbsp;For the actual Tx of the AF, we do rate control before rhythm control (the management is actually&nbsp;heavily&nbsp;involved,&nbsp;but&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;USMLE&nbsp;know&nbsp;the&nbsp;following):	"<div>&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Rate control: </b>beta-blocker first-line (metoprolol). If beta-blocker
avoided (i.e., severe or psychotic
depression, sexual dysfunction, COPD, Hx of asthma requiring oxygen or hospitalization, 2nd/3rd-degree heart
block), verapamil is the next choice. If rate control fails, go to rhythm control.</div><div><br></div>
<div>o&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>Rhythm control: </b>Flecainide (type-Ic Na channel blocker) first-line in
those without any structural (i.e.,
LVH or valvular problems) or coronary artery disease (any symptomatology of CVD or PVD means patient has coronary
artery disease). In those who cannot receive
flecainide, other anti-arrhythmics like amiodarone, dronedarone, and dofetilide
may be used.</div>"

&nbsp;Why high serum K in DKA	"<div>â three main reasons: 1) insulin normally drives K into cells,
so if insulin isnât there, K is
higher in blood; 2) less glucose driven into cells by GLUT4 (bc normally
upregulated by insulin) means less
ATP production â normally 1 ATP drives 2K into cell and 3Na out; so if
less ATP- ase activation, less K
enters cell â higher in blood; 3) potassium-proton exchange; if
acidosis ensues, more H driven into cells means
K moves out to balance
charge â hyperkalemia<br></div>"
Then&nbsp;what&nbsp;does&nbsp;low&nbsp;total&nbsp;body&nbsp;potassium&nbsp;mean&nbsp;	"<div>â just to be clear, the patient is hyperkalemic (high K
in the blood) yet has low K overall in the body â kidney
senses high K in urine and therefore increases excretion
of it (kaliuresis) â body is now losing K â but three above mechanisms leading to hyperkalemia continue unabated, so K stays high in serum even though body is now urinating it out.</div>"
Why&nbsp;does&nbsp;the&nbsp;potassium&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;matter&nbsp;so&nbsp;much&nbsp;with&nbsp;DKA&nbsp;	"<div>â because when you Tx DKA and start giving
insulin (<b>fluids first btw; </b>giving
insulin immediately is the wrong answer; give insulin after first administering a bolus of normal saline), K
will now be driven into the cells, which will bring K down to normal in the serum, but bear in mind it
was low in the cells â so now risk of normal in cells but low in blood â need to
supplement K to patient when K falls below 5.2 (normal is 3.5-5 mEq/L). Stop
all insulin if K falls

Cancer&nbsp;caused&nbsp;by&nbsp;H.&nbsp;pylori?&nbsp;	"<div>â MALT lymphoma (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma); H. pylori is
considered a pre-MALT lymphoma condition, where eradication causes remission of
80% of low-grade stage 1E MALT lymphomas (confined to mucosa + submucosa).</div>"
&nbsp;Key points about Whipple disease?&nbsp;	"<div>â caused by bacterium <i>Tropheryma Whipplei </i>â causes PAS- positive macrophages in the lamina propria
of the small bowel (USMLE is obsessed with this detail); can cause arthritis and diarrhea. Tx = Abx (e.g., doxycycline).<br></div>"
Celiac&nbsp;disease&nbsp;important&nbsp;points?	"<div>â gluten intolerance; fluten found in wheat, oats, rye, and barley, so therefore
will get Sx after eating, e.g., pasta (too easy for the vignette to mention
though); causes flattening of
intestinal villi on biopsy (image HY); patients often present with <b>iron deficiency anemia (HY way
to differentiate from lactose
intolerance); </b>Dx with Abs: anti-endomysial
IgA (anti-gliadin IgA), anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA â after you get positive Abs in Dx of Celiac, USMLE wants <b>duodenal
biopsy </b>to confirm (âno further studies indicatedâ is the wrong answer) â Tx = dietary changes to avoid gluten.</div>"
âIâve heard IgA deficiency relates somehow to Celiac. Can you explain.â	"<div>â Remember that âautoimmune
diseases go together,â so increased risk of one means increased risk of
another; the HLA associations are not super-strict â if patient
has Celiac, he or she is 10-15x
more likely to have IgA deficiency (which one comes first is
up for debate) â because these patients are IgA deficient, they will have false-negative results
on antibody screening (since Abs are IgA).</div>"
Weird&nbsp;factoid&nbsp;about&nbsp;Celiac?	"<div>â increased risk of T cell lymphoma;
HLA-DQ2/8 positive.</div>"
&nbsp;What&nbsp;immunoglobulin&nbsp;is&nbsp;produced&nbsp;at&nbsp;Peyer&nbsp;patches&nbsp;(GALT;&nbsp;gut-associated&nbsp;lymphoid&nbsp;tissue)?	"<div>â IgA. Peyer patches contain
large number of IgA-secreting B cells. IgA is a dimer connected by a J-chain.</div>"
USMLE wants you to know&nbsp;<b>colipase deficiency&nbsp;</b>is a reason why a patient with chronic pancreatitis might not be able to digest triglycerides	"<div>â yes, weird and random,
but I donât know what to tell you. Itâs on the NBME.</div>"
Whatâs&nbsp;Zollinger-Ellison&nbsp;syndrome?	"<div>&nbsp;gastrin-secreting tumor â USMLE likes ârecurrentâ duodenal
ulcers, or the presence of any single jejunal or ileal ulcer â frequently seen as part of MEN1 (pancreas, pituitary, parathyroid).</div>"
Dx of ZES?&nbsp;	"<div>check serum gastrin levels; if USMLE mentions
secretin-stimulation test, itâs only because
theyâll say in the vignette
that âgastrin is not suppressed with secretin stimulationâ as a way to tell you the Dx is ZES â secretin should normally lower gastrin levels, but they
remain elevated in ZES.</div>"
Tx&nbsp;of&nbsp;ZES?	<div>â PPIs, but definitive is surgical resection of tumor.</div>
What is Menetrier disease?	"<div>â donât confuse with Meniere disease; Menetrier is atrophy of
parietal cells (causing achlorhydria)
and hypertrophy of foveolar cells (surface mucous cells) to the extent that the inner lining of stomach resembles
brain gyri; can be caused by CMV infection; Meniere disease, in contrast, is a tinnitus/vertigo syndrome
caused by defective endolymphatic drainage from the inner ear.<br></div>"
Types of stomach cancer (apart from MALT lymphoma)	"<div>&nbsp;intestinal vs diffuse type; USMLE doesnât ask about intestinal (itâs characterized
by irregular tubular histology); diffuse = linitis plastica, which is âleather bottleâ appearance of the
stomach â cells contain mucin and are called signet ring cells â often associated with Virchow node (pronounced
ver-cough), which is a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node â this positive
node is called Troisier sign of malignancy â if gastric
cancer metastasizes hematogenously to ovaries, the mets are
called Krukenberg tumors â biopsy shows signet ring cells containing mucin; youâll know itâs not mucinous
cystadenocarcinoma (MC) of ovary because 1, MC
isnât the bilateral type (serous cystadenocarcinoma is), 2, MC is
associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei
(peritoneal infiltration by mucous from tumor), and 3, MC has a âlocular,â or

Over-arching&nbsp;HY&nbsp;point&nbsp;about&nbsp;hepatitis&nbsp;infections&nbsp;for&nbsp;USMLE	"<div>â <span style=""color: rgb(0, 255, 0);"">they want you to know that hepatocellular damage

&nbsp;Hepatitis A HY points&nbsp;	"<div>â fecal-oral; acute; shortest incubation period (2-6 weeks);
vignette will mention person getting acute hepatitis in US or Mexico â can be asymptomatic, but jaundice, fever,
anorexia common; self-limiting â thereâs a Q
on one of the 2CK NBMEs where a patient gets HepA followed by all cell lines (RBCs, WBCs, platelets) down, and the
diagnosis was simply viral-induced aplastic
anemia, but this was slightly unusual as we classically associate Parvo B19
with viral-induced aplastic anemia.</div>"
Hepatitis B HY points&nbsp;	"<div>â parenteral transmission; in all body fluids and can be
transmitted through breastmilk, sex,
and IV drug use â most common transmission is vertical at birth (through
birth canal); vignettes associate
HepB with China; 30% of patients with polyarteritis nodosa are HepB seropositive; HepB can also cause
membranous glomerulonephritis; at birth, give HepB vaccine, followed by a second dose at 2 months, and
a third dose at 6 months (apparently some vaccine schedules are saying itâs no longer given at 4 months); if mom
is positive for HepB, give neonate immunoglobulin
+ vaccine; if momâs status is unknown, give neonate vaccine + only give immunoglobulin if momâs results
come back positive;
liver shows ground-glass appearance on biopsy</div>
<div>â I believe a
UWSA2 question for Step 1 gave an IV drug user + they showed a liver with a
ground- glass appearance, and the
answer was HepB; everyone selects HepC because they say, âoh wow IV drug user,â but it was HepB; HepC has a
nodular appearance of the liver; both HepB and C and cause hepatocellular carcinoma; USMLE is obsessed with HepB serology:</div>"

Tx&nbsp;for&nbsp;HepB?	"<div>â a variety
of meds; the USMLE isnât really fussed

<div>&nbsp;HepC important info<br></div>	"<div>
<div>&nbsp;â longest incubation period (2-26 weeks); can become chronic;
parenteral transmission; transmitted
by blood only; <b>not sexually transmitted </b>(if
you spend an hour and do a comprehensive literature review yourself, youâll
learn that the transmission rate among heterosexual couples
where one partner is infected is exceedingly low, i.e., on the order of 1 in

HepD important points&nbsp;	"<div>â called a âsubviral satelliteâ because it depends on HepB to

<div>Risk/benefit
analysis is an important step in determining whether a novel treatment should
be used in clinical practice. The

<div>&nbsp;</div>

a precursor to SCC, actinic keratosis carries excellent prognosis and is
curative with treatment methods such

"<div>&nbsp;A
group of researchers is interested in finding out whether IV drug-use by
patients at a select hospital is
associated with increased risk of atrial myxoma compared to non-drug-users. A
study is performed by searching
through medical records of patients who have history of IV drug-use versus the medical records of those who do
not have history of IV drug-use. Which of the
following best describes
this study design
and why it was chosen?<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Case-control study;
myxoma cases not well-documented at the select hospital</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

hospital</div>

cases well-documented at the select hospital</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retrospective cohort study; myxoma
cases not well-documented at the select
hospital</div>
<div>F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Retrospective cohort study; myxoma
cases well-documented at the select
hospital</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cohort studies always move in the direction of risk factor Ã  disease. That is: Group with risk factor vs Group without
risk factor Ã  did they develop
the disease.</div>
<div>Case-control studies are the opposite. They move in the
direction of disease Ã  risk factor. That is:
Group with disease
vs Group without
disease Ã  did they have
the risk factor.</div>
<div>Case-control
studies are ideal for assessing rare conditions. If you want to determine
whether, e.g., a rare type of
pancreatic cancer is caused by smoking, it is not feasible to do a cohort study because this would entail needing to
follow smokers vs non-smokers and seeing whether over time they happen to specifically develop this rare type
of cancer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Instead, a case-control study would enable first starting
with a group of patients
who have the rare type of cancer and then simply
looking back to see
whether they were smokers or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So
where does retrospective cohort study come into play?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cohort studies are almost always prospective. Once again,
they are always in the direction of risk factor
Ã  disease. <i>But if
the process has already happened and youâre looking at medical records</i>, then your observations are retrospective, and we call
it a retrospective cohort study.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a
hospital has not specifically documented its myxoma cases, then thereâs no way
to start with a case-control study
because we donât have a way of assembling a case (disease) group. In this scenario weâd be forced to say, âWell our
original question is whether IV drug-use relates to development of myxomas, but we donât have a way of isolating out
those who developed myxomas, so weâd
have to manually and cumbersomely look back through the medical records of IV drug-users vs non-drug users to see who
developed myxoma at this hospital.â</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: Case-control studies are always disease Ã  risk factor.
Cohort studies are always risk factor
Ã  disease. Almost all cohort studies are prospective.
Retrospective cohort studies are applied
in a public health setting when the research entails looking back through the
medical records of those who had a
risk factor vs no risk factor and seeing whether they developed the disease.</div>"

correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Minors
have the right to confidentiality <i>without
</i>parental consent for sexual health, obstetric/gynecologic care, drug-use, and/or mental health management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In
this case, the minor has a right to have her sexual activity withheld from her
parents. Breaching this confidentiality jeopardizes
non-maleficence â i.e., it does harm if she believes there will be punative measures against her if her mom
knows. The result is she may not seek continued care with the physician, or may learn to distrust doctors in general,
putting her at greater risk for problems going forward.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Even
though sexual activity is one of the greatest risk factors for UTIs, the latter
in and of themselves do not fall
under the envelope of conditions that can be withheld from parents. This child needs antibiotics for her UTI. The
consent of her mom is required. This needs to be communicated to the minor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If
the minor is emancipated, then no parental
consent is required,
even for UTI management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Emancipated
minors are those who are not dependent on their parents for everyday life and
are therefore eligible to make
healthcare decisions without parental consent. This refers to minors who are in the military, living independently
(e.g., a high-school graduate with a full-time job who lives away from home), or who have
children of their own whom they support. Non-emancipated minors require parental consent for most
conditions until the age of 18. An important exception is healthcare in a life-threatening situation (e.g.,
emergency blood transfusions).</div>"

refuses. Which of the following is the appropriate response by the
physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI will kindly ask you to step out.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âIt
is important that I speak to your daughter in private.â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âNo
problem.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThat is okay, but I will need to document
that we have not been able to address
all aspects of your daughterâs health.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âWould you like for one of our nurses to sit in
with the two of us?â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Offering to have
a female member of staff sit in during the consult
is one effective way to make parents feel more
comfortable leaving their children
alone with a physician.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If
the mother ultimately refuses to allow her daughter be left alone with the
physician, this must be respected,
but also documented. However offering to have a female member of staff sit in
during the consult is a solution
that should first be attempted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If
the physician suspects child abuse, he or she must contact child protective
services, but this is not advised
in a setting where abuse is not specifically suspected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice A is dismissive of the parentâs refusal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice B is a reiteration of what the
physician already attempted prior to the parentâs refusal.</div>"
"<div>A
15-year-old female presents to the clinic accompanied by her mother for a
routine health maintenance
examination. The physician would like to ask more details about her sexual
history. Which of the
following is the most appropriate next step in communication?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
questions while both the patient and mother are present together</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the mother to leave
the room before asking the patient questions</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the patient to leave
the room before asking the mother questions</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the patient in front of her
mother if she is okay answering questions
about sexual history</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have the mother step out of the room and call for a female
nurse to be present</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Similar
to the previous question, the first step in attempting to ask a minor questions
is kindly asking the parent to step
out. If the parent refuses, offering for a female member of staff to sit in is sometimes effective. If the parent
refuses again, his or her wishes must be respected, followed by proper documentation by the physician. If
the physician does not suspect abuse, there is no need for reporting. Parents have
a right to refuse physicians spending time with their children.</div>"
"<div>An
81-year-old man has recently been diagnosed with stage 2 pancreatic cancer and
malignant pleural effusion. The
patient is not interested in aggressive treatments and would like to be
referred for hospice care. The
physician explains that without treatment his life expectancy would be approximately 8 months. Which of the
following would make this patient ineligible for hospice referral at this time?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Insufficient stage
of cancer</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Patient prognosis</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Patient declination of aggressive treatment</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Periodic thoracentesis</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are no contraindications for hospice care at this point in time</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Eligibility
for hospice care necessitates terminal illness with a prognosis of &lt;6 months
of life remaining. The patient must
also not be pursuing, or interested in pursuing, any type of life- extending
management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
stage of pancreatic cancer cancer is irrelevant. If the patient had Stage 1
cancer and a 4-month prognosis, he
would be eligible for hospice care insofar as he is not interested in pursuing
life- extending measures.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Types of management that make a patient ineligible for
hospice care include any type of chemo- or
radiotherapy, as these extend life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sounds
highly specific and weird, but USMLE 2CK wants you to be aware that
thoracentesis <i>is an acceptable </i>management to be received by those in hospice care. The implication is that those with, e.g., malignant pleural effusions, may
receive thoracentesis to improve symptoms, but the management in and of itself does not extend life.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp; A
42-year-old man with terminal amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) was
transferred to hospice care one week
ago. The patient says he would like to take part in a clinical trial of a new
drug for advanced ALS that may
improve prognosis. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Allow the patient to leave hospice
and inform him he will not
be eligible to return</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Allow
the patient to partake in the clinical trial while
in hospice</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
not allow the patient to leave the hospice</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request psychiatric evaluation of the
patient</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer the patient to palliative care</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients
who are receiving hospice care are free to leave at any point if they wish to
pursue more aggressive management of
their condition. The requirements for hospice admission are terminal illness with prognosis of &lt; 6 months and no pursuit
of life-extending treatments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
A is werong because the patient is free to resume hospice care if he wishes to
terminate his prescription of the
new drug. While patients are allowed to take medication while in hospice, this new drug may improve prognosis and
therefore is considered life-extending, meaning it cannot be taken while
in hospice care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
aims of palliative care are to optimize quality of life and mitigate suffering
in patients who may have &gt;6 months of life remaining and who may be seeking
life-extending management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Palliative care happens in hospital. Hospice
care occurs wherever
the patient calls home.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Palliative
care may be paid by insurance or self-pay. Hospice care is covered by Medicaid, Medicare, or insurance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

line: Patients in hospice who wish to pursue life-extending management may be transferred to palliative care.</div>"
"<div>A 75-year-old man presents to the emergency department
with sudden-onset severe headache, nausea,
vomiting, photophobia, and neck stiffness. He was in his usual state of health
until this morning when the symptoms
began. His past medical history is significant for hypertension managed with hydrochlorothiazide and
lisinopril. He was in a serious car accident 20 years ago that left him in a coma for one month. A
non-contrast CT of the head confirms subarachnoid hemorrhage. Despite the best efforts of the physicians, the
patientâs condition deteriorates and he becomes
non-responsive over the next few hours. Brain-stem reflexes are absent. The
patient cannot breathe spontaneously
and is pronounced brain-dead. The physicians are preparing to discontinue life support. However, the
patientâs spouse and children insist that the patient had beaten the odds multiple times before and
that they are certain he will recover again. Moreover, they have seen many reports about miraculous recoveries. They
threaten to sue the physician if life support is discontinued.
Which of the following is the most appropriate
action by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Continue life support</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consult the hospital ethics committee</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
an electroencephalogram (EEG)</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer care to another
physician</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Withdraw life support</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Physicians
are not required to provide futile care when there is no prospect of the
patient recovering. In this case, the
patient is brain-dead and further treatment would not change his prognosis.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>EEG
and MR angiography can be considered in uncertain cases but are not required to
diagnose brain-death in this patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Absence
of brainstem reflexes and apnea test prove brain-death. Coma and brain-death
should not be confused. Treating a
brain-dead patient is futile, while treating a comatose patient
is not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
hospital ethics committee can be consulted when there are differences in
opinion between family members
regarding what an incapacitated patient
might want in terms of care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Transfer
of care to another physician is the answer on the USMLE if a patient wishes to discontinue life support but the physician
wishes not to do it. This is on the NBME exams. The implication is that care will be discontinued as per the patientâs
autonomy and wishes, but the physician
who is strongly opposed to the discontinuation distances him or herself from
the decision for emotional reasons. Transfer of care to another
physician is acceptable in this scenario.</div>"

correct answer is C.</div>

even if they are emancipated. Parents
cannot refuse life-saving transfusions for their children.</div>

any meaningful history.
He does not want to stay at the hospital. Fifteen minutes later, the

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ask the patient why he

<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prescribe meperidine</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
patient has received difficult news and is at high risk of depression. He needs
to be communicated with empathetically
and provided all support
services possible. Further
discussion with the patient will be beneficial for his ability to cope with the poor prognostic information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Psychiatric
liaison may provide benefit for this patient if he develops major depression
due to a medical disorder. However in
this current scenario, the patientâs thought process merely needs to be explored further.
Consultation with psychiatry is premature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hospitalizing the patient, voluntarily or involuntarily,
is not necessary at this time. If he communicates suicidal
ideation, involuntary admission
to hospital would be required.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

Commence the patient on sertraline</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult psychiatry</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients who are
in severe pain can appear
as though they have
major depression even when they do
not. Pain control is one of the most important facets of ethics for USMLE.
Always fully treat pain, even if the
patient has history of drug abuse.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is
acceptable to give high doses of pain medication that may inadvertently
facilitate end of life. When you are
answering tough questions on USMLE, the general rule is: never withhold
adequate pain management no matter
what. It is never okay to allow patients
to suffer from pain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It should
be noted, in contrast, that physician-assisted suicide (e.g., prescribing high
doses of benzodiazepines to a patient
who wants to end his or her life) and euthanasia (intentionally ending a patientâs life, unrelated to pain
management) are illegal in most of the United States. Ethical views vary among physicians.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
USMLE will not ask questions with equivocal answers. Your knowledge going into
the exam should be simply:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Physician-assisted
suicide and euthanasia are not acceptable. Always fully treat pain.</div>"
"<div>A 78-year-old man with a past
medical history significant for terminal multiple myeloma has been hospitalized due to hip fracture. The
patient has been bed-bound for the past month and is deemed a poor surgical candidate. Morphine is
used to manage pain. Following admission, the patient develops pneumonia and a decision is made to provide comfort
care only. The patientâs respiratory rate

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Administer naloxone</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Decrease the dose
of morphine and administer oral ibuprofen</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase the dose of morphine</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain the dose of morphine and add intravenous acetaminophen</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Send for a ventilator</div>"	"<div>The correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Increasing the dose of morphine increases the immediate
risk of death for this patient. However this
patient has already been deemed terminally ill and has been put on comfort
measures only. While physician-assisted
suicide (with the exception of a few states) is illegal, interventions that may hasten the end
of life are considered ethically permissible if they aim to reduce pain.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is
the aim of the intervention that is important. This patient is still in pain.
Increasing the dose of morphine is
appropriate regardless of whether it may hasten end of life. Prescribing
medications to a patient with the
aim of facilitating death, on the other hand, is unethical, and almost always illegal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Intravenous
acetaminophen is highly effective for minor pain. In the setting of a patient
on opioids with cancer pain who
needs even more pain relief, acetaminophen is unlikely to be effective. The difficult takeaway here is: fully treat
pain, even if it facilitates respiratory depression and end of life.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom line: Managing pain is ethically
permissible even if it hastens end of life.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp;A 77-year-old man with Alzheimer

memory. Which of the following is most accurate with respect to this patient?<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The diagnosis
of Alzheimer disease makes the patient incompetent</div>
<div>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
normal neurologic examination makes the patient
competent</div>
<div>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
patientâs diminished short-term memory makes him incompetent</div>
<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
patientâs intact retrograde memory makes him competent</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The
patientâs understanding of the consequences of his decision and the rationale
provided make him competent</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Adult
patients are presumed to be competent to make healthcare decisions until proven
otherwise. It is very difficult to
show an adult is incompetent. The most important aspect of determining competence is determining whether
the patient understands the possible
consequences of his or her decision
and can provide some form of rationale for it, even if the physician disagrees
with the patientâs sentiments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This
patient states he does not wish to undergo any treatment. He is entitled to
make such a decision. The diagnosis
of Alzheimer disease does not make one incompetent, nor does impaired short-term memory.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Competence
does not depend on the neurologic exam unless the patient is in a state of
delirium that interferes with the ability to be
examined.</div>

<div>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
hospital legal team should be consulted before following the living will</div>
<div>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two or more adult children present
may override a living will</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
durable power of attorney in healthcare is a person designated to make
decisions on behalf of a patient. If
the patient becomes incapacitated, the durable power of attorney equals the
patient for all intents and purposes,
surpassing in priority any verbal wishes the patient may have made prior to incapacitation,
as well as the patientâs living will.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In other words,
the durable power of attorney
can make all personal and legal decisions
on behalf of the patient
if he or she becomes incapacitated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There are four
main types of Power of Attorney:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>General power of attorney: </b>the designated individual can perform most acts as the
principal, including managing
finances and opening accounts. The general power of attorney arrangement is terminated if the patient becomes
incapacitated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Durable power of attorney: </b>the designated individual can act on the principalâs
behalf and includes a durable clause that maintains this power
even if the patient becomes
incapacitated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Springing durable power of attorney: </b>the designated individual becomes the durable power of attorney only when the patient becomes
incapacitated. Prior to incapacitation, the designated individual does not act as a power of attorney
for the patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Special or limited power of attorney: </b>the designated individual has power limited to a specific area,
such as selling the property of the patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: A durable power of attorney overrides the living will (advanced
directive) in the setting of patient
incapacitation, even if the patient specified wishes to the contrary
immediately prior to incapacitation.</div>"

treatment for this patient?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask

<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide comfort care only</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request the patient rescind
the DNR form before treatment</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>DNR
stands for âdo not resuscitateâ. It does not stand for âdo not provide adequate
medical care.â If this patient were
to develop cardiorespiratory arrest, it would be inappropriate to resuscitate
her as this would clearly violate
her directive. However, the DNR form does not apply to any other aspect of patient care and all other
appropriate measures should be implemented as they would for any other patient. Therefore, discharging the patient
or withholding care would be inappropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: DNR forms are a legal order whereby a patient may refuse cardiopulmonary resuscitation if his or her heart stops.
This does not apply to interventions such as percutaneous coronary intervention in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.</div>"

She does not want any of her family members to know that she may not survive this hospitalization. Upon leaving the
patientâs room, the physician is confronted
by the patientâs husband who demands to know the patientâs prognosis. He says
that their children live out
of state and need to be informed. He is her durable power of attorney.
Which of the following would be the appropriate response by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHave you spoken to your wife about this?â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI

request for release of medical records.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI am sorry but your wifeâs condition
is serious and the next few hours are
critical to see how she responds
to treatment.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âYour wife is stable and will make
a full recovery.â</div>"	"<div>The correct answer is B.
This is a âhardâ question.</div>
<div>The
patient clearly stated that she does not want her prognosis shared with any
famly members. This must be firmly
respected by the physician. The patientâs spouse, although the durable power of attorney, only acts on behalf of the patient in the medical
setting if she becomes incapacitated. While the patient is awake
and communicating, the patientâs wishes must be followed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
A is wrong because it equivocates the wishes of the patient despite the fact
that they have already been firmly expressed by her. The physician needs to respect
the wishes of the patient and communicate
to the spouse that her prognosis cannot be discussed right now. If the
physician responds with choice A,
then this might put the patient in an uncomfortable position where she feels compelled to discuss her condition
further despite not wanting to. Had the patient not explicitly communicated a preference, <i>then </i>choice A might be
more appropriate.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Establish
the diagnosis in the patient </b>â e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Counsel patient </b>â explain nature
of infection, how it is transmitted, the range of symptoms, possible complications,
treatment, and follow-up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Motivate
patient to notify
partners </b>â explain the importance of informing contacts
and preventing spread.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Negotiate plan for sexual contact </b>â ask about current and past partners and agree who will inform each one. Make a record of each
contact with names, contact details, and plans for how to contact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<b>Monitor progress </b>â follow up with the patient
about whether contacts
have been notified<br>"

<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No
information can be released</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires âminimum
necessaryâ disclosure, meaning that
the physician should disclose the minimal amount of information that is necessary (for the employer
in this case).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patient
confidentiality should be maintained even if he or she has signed the release
of information. No information can be shared
without the consent of the
patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There
is no need for the employer to know the exact diagnosis. While the patient
should be advised to abstain from
unhealthy amounts of alcohol, notifying the employer of this recommendation would be inappropriate. The
physician should only notify the employer of the patientâs fitness to return to work.
No additional information should be shared.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ensuring that brain-death is pronounced

correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
American Medical Association (AMA) provides ethics guidelines for organ
transplantation. The medical
team involved in providing end-of-life care and pronouncing the time of death should
not be the same as the
team involved in organ transplantation due to potential
conflicts of interest.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is important that the staff involved in the organ
transplantation process are educated and that it is performed at an adequately equipped facility. The organs are a
national, rather than a state or local resource, and can be transferred as needed.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A compensation equivalent to the cost of the
medical procedure only is acceptable</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A

compensation agreed upon personally by the recipient and donor is acceptable</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
patient may not sell
his kidney but may attempt
to donate it</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Federal law prohibits the purchase or sale
of organs from deceased
and live donors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Such payments have been prohibited since Congress passed
the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Gift law requires that any donor gifting an organ do so without monetary receipt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although
the cost of the medical procedure and travel reimbursement may sometimes be

<div>Mandatory
reporting of suspected or confirmed abuse applies to situations involving minors (under 18), elderly (60+), and/or persons with disabilities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Domestic abuse among adults
does not require mandatory reporting. Patients should be supplied with a full spectrum of information
(e.g., pamphlets, hotlines) and counseling. Treatment of victims of domestic abuse is aimed at preventing repetitions of
violence and may require a combined effort between social
services and healthcare professionals.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: It is mandatory to report abuse of minors, elderly, and persons with
disabilities. Domestic abuse
among adults should
be approached from an angle of
providing information and resources to the abused, rather than reporting the abuse.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âCan you please tell me in more detail

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The

<div>The parent should not be directly confronted about the
potential abuse since he or she may flee with the child, thereby putting the child at risk of further harm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
caregiver will almost never admit the
truth of his or her actions.
If the physician suspects abuse,
asking for further detail is not the most appropriate step. The
physician must admit the child and contact child protect services.</div>

was recently hospitalized for vulvar bruising and thigh lacerations that she attributed
to falling from a chair. On examination, a large bruise is noted on the right
side of her chest. Chest x-ray
confirms fractures of the 3rd and 4th ribs. The patient mentions several times that she has a partner who loves her

know it is difficult to talk about abuse but I assure you everything you say is confidential.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Unlike
with elder/child abuse, cases of suspected domestic abuse between adults should
not be reported without their
consent. In this case, it is likely that the patient is being abused by an intimate partner and it needs to be explored further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>An open-ended question is the best way to initiate
a discussion. Once the patient becomes more forthright about the situation, it may be appropriate
to ask more direct questions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Immediately confronting the patientâs description of the
events would unlikely make her reveal the abuse.
If the patient does reveal the abuse, the next step would be to supply her with
a spectrum of information (e.g.,
pamphlets, hotlines) and ensure her safety by identifying a place she can go to

"<div>A

strictly forbids it. Which of the following is the appropriate response to the patientâs request?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âAbortion is not something we should consider in this case.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

one if you so wish.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âYes, I can carry out a termination of pregnancy for you if you wish.â</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Many
physicians are opposed to abortions for a variety of reasons and do not wish to
perform them. They are also not
required to. Since this patient has the right to terminate her pregnancy, the physician should refer the patient to a physician who will carry
out the management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Following
the 1973 United States Supreme Court landmark decision, <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and subsequent companion
decisions, abortion is legal in all 50 US states. It may however be restricted
by the states to varying degrees.
Some states have passed laws to restrict late-term abortions or have laws requiring parental notification for minors.</div>"
"<div>At
the end of his shift at the state prison, a physician is asked to assist the
prison personnel in an execution of
an inmate who has been sentenced to death for a mass murder. The inmate is a
known intravenous drug abuser and
the prison staff anticipate difficulties obtaining adequate IV access to administer the lethal substances. They
believe the assistance of a physician would reduce the risk of the inmate suffering. They also need
the physician to prescribe a sedative a few hours before the execution to relieve the inmate of anxiety

of the following would be
the most appropriate actions by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Physician
participation in executions or torture in any form is not allowed. The
physician may not advise the
execution team on how to perform the execution, mix the drugs, or start the IV.
The physician may also not certify
the death immediately after it has occurred, but only after the inmate is pronounced dead by another
member of the team. Prescribing diazepam to relieve anxiety prior to the execution is acceptable as this is aimed
solely at relieving suffering and is in no
way participating in the actual execution. It is also unethical for physicians
to participate in torture or to use
their knowledge or skills in any way that would facilitate it, regardless of circumstances and who orders
it.</div>"
"<div>A

isosorbide dinitrate, and acetaminophen.
The physician suspects the patient has been having difficulties managing an increasing number of medications. Which of
the following is the most correct way to initiate this conversation with the patient?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHow do you feel about how we are

<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âWould you like me to call your children
to help you with medications?â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is helpful to initiate a discussion by acknowledging the difficulty the patient
may be facing and asking an open-ended question, allowing the patient
to express her thoughts in her own words.</div>
<div>This
can then be followed by more detailed and direct questions. If the patient says
that she has been struggling to take her medications regularly, then possible solutions can be explored,
such as ânegotiating a
contract,â which means writing
things down (on NBME).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is important not to come across judgmentally, which could make the patient
defensive and less likely to disclose
any issues she may be having. The suggestion of involving the patientâs

<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Briefly describe the findings
on the scan</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take additional history</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When
delivering bad news to a patient, one of the most important initial strategies
is to ensure the setting for
communication is appropriate and the patient feels comfortable. When initiating
a conversation, it is advisable to
establish the patientâs baseline understanding of need for testing so that the
rest of the conversation can be adapted to accordingly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While
it may be beneficial to the patient to have a family member there with him
during the delivery of bad news, the
patient has asked point-blank what his CT showed. It is therefore the responsibility of the physician
to inform the patient of the
news, sensitively and empathetically. It is not mandatory to break bad news with family members
present.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Briefly
describing the findings of the CT without first establishing the patientâs
understanding of his need for the
scan does not establish a communicative and empathetic framework for delivering bad news.</div>

<div>Taking additional history at this moment is dilatory
and circumvents the delivery of bad news.</div>"

is the best way to respond to this patientâs
denial of her diagnosis?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âIâd like to discuss
with you what we will do from here.â</div>

correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
physician must acknowledge the patientâs feelings of denial in order to
establish rapport and engage in
meaningful discussion. It is common for patients who feel healthy to struggle
to grasp the gravity of their
diagnosis. Delivering bad news requires establishing the patientâs baseline
level of understanding of the situation through
empathetic statements, which are then followed by a more detailed explanation by the
physician. At each step, the patientâs feelings must be acknowledged and respected. She should be given sufficient time
to process the information. It would
be inappropriate to interrogate the patient or to criticize her, just like it
would be inappropriate to say that
everything is going to be fine because the outcome is impossible to know at this point.</div>

Withhold management because radiotherapy only is futile</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Children
cannot independently give consent to their own cancer treatment. In the event
that parents disagree regarding the
nature of how management should proceed, an attempt to establish further consensus
should be sought.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If
the father ultimately refuses the orchiectomy component for his son, this
procedure cannot be performed. The
question as to whether to proceed with radiotherapy only in this case would be
up to the discretion of the physician.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When parents
refuse cancer treatment, there
are usually four main reasons:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1)&nbsp; They prefer alternative and/or
complimentary medicine.</div>

Conflicts in relation to faith.</div>

can usually reach resolutions with parents by listening to their concerns and
engaging in informative discussion
with disclosure of all risks and benefits. Clinicians may involve secondary consults with psychologists, ethicists,
chaplains, or the palliative care team. A multi-disciplinary approach may help all parties reach a
consensus. However, ultimately, the parents have the right to refuse

inappropriately demanding to be seen
after-hours for a non-urgent matter. The physician should be firm, but polite, and explain to the patient that she
should respect the business hours of the practice and make an appointment. Examining the patient
after-hours would only encourage similar behaviors in the future.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Referring the patient to an on-call
physician would be inappropriate since
this can be resolved during
office hours.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be inappropriate to refer her to the emergency department for
something that is unlikely to be a medical emergency.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Telling a patient that her behavior is inappropriate
would damage the physician-patient relationship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the physician believes the situation is a genuine
medical emergency, he or she can choose to manage the patient or see
that she receives appropriate care at
an emergency department.</div>

"<div>A
75-year-old woman is being treated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Her
functional status has deteriorated
significantly and her prognosis is &lt;6 months of life remaining. Her
neurologist recommended she be
transferred to hospice care. However, during her last hospitalization for pneumonia, another neurologist recommended
her for a clinical trial and believes that a new stem- cell based treatment could prolong her survival. The patient
says she just wants what is best for her. Which
of the following is the appropriate next step by her primary
care physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ask the patient how she
feels about hospice care and the clinical trial</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contact the two neurologists and try coordinating care</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refer the patient for hospice
care</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Refer the patient for the
clinical trial</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Request the opinion of a third
neurologist</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One
of the roles of the primary care physician is to coordinate care. In this case,
the two neurologists disagree on the
course of action for this particular patient. The primary care physician should not judge the competence of two
specialists by choosing which of their opinions to trust but instead
try reaching out to them and seeing
whether an agreement can be
reached. It is possible
that the reason the physicians disagree is that one is not aware of
the clinical trial.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
final decision for any treatment is made by the patient as per her autonomy,
but the primary care physician should first try to reach an agreement
between the neurologists as the next best step.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: When disagreements arise between healthcare providers, one of the roles
of the primary care physician is to
coordinate care for the patient by enhancing communication between parties.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp;A
55-year-old woman is about to undergo elective cholecystectomy. While obtaining

rationale behind the procedure, the basics of the operating technique,
alternative treatments, and
complications. She is given a list of all medications that will be used during
the procedure and informed that a
resident surgeon will also be present in theater. Which of the following
could have been omitted
while obtaining consent?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Alternative treatments</div>

<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgical technique</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>During
the process of obtaining consent, the patient must be told why the procedure is
to be done, how it is done, what
possible complications there are, and whether any alternative treatment options exist. She also needs to know who
the physician performing the procedure is and if other staff may play a role in the surgery. It is not necessary to
provide a list of all medications used during
the procedure, although her relevant history of allergies and past/current
medications are paramount to know.</div>"

35-year-old man has been hospitalized for acute pancreatitis. Over the next few
days he develops a large pseudocyst. Internal drainage via ERCP is planned. The resident on the team has no experience with this procedure. The

which of the following team members to obtain consent
for the procedure?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending physician and the nurse</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending physician and the resident</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending physician only</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attending physician, the resident, and the nurse</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This procedure does not require
additional consent once the patient has consented to pancreatitis management</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Consent
should be obtained by the team member most familiar with the procedure who can
answer any questions the patient
may have. While it may be acceptable for medical students,
residents, and support staff
to accompany the attending physician while obtaining consent, in order for the patient
to be fully informed, the attending him or herself
must obtain the consent.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
would be inappropriate to ask the nurse to obtain consent. Likewise, the
resident does not have sufficient
knowledge of the procedure to be able to fully inform the patient. Consent is
necessary for surgical
interventions. Just because the patient consented to hospitalization and
pancreatitis management does not automatically mean he consents
to pseudocyst drainage via ERCP.</div>"
"<div>A
75-year old woman presents to the clinic because of unstable blood pressure.
She is accompanied by her 45-year old
daughter. The patient is an immigrant from Guatemala and speaks limited English. Her daughter is
comfortable being the interpreter for her mother. The physicianâs knowledge
of Spanish is limited.
Which of the following is the
best approach to this situation?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow the daughter to translate</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempt to speak the patientâs native language</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Provide all information in written Spanish</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak slowly and use images to illustrate ideas</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use
an official interpreter</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When a situation is non-urgent and an official
interpreter can be reached,
either in-person or over the
phone, this is always preferable over having family members carry out
translations. This is because family
members may inadvertently alter the meaning of important communication, or a patient may not wish to have the family
member involved in certain parts of the communication process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Speaking
slowly and using images may be advisable alongside providing written
information, however it is important
to communicate to the patient in a language she can understand to reduce the likelihood of medical error.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
would be acceptable for a family member to translate in an emergency when an
official translator cannot immediately be reached.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
physician should not use a language he or she is uncomfortable with since
miscommunication can have serious consequences.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bottom
line: Many patients will be perfectly willing to have family members carry out translations, but in non-urgent situations the most appropriate step is to seek an official interpreter.</div>"
"<div>A 68-year-old woman with metastatic lymphoma presents to the emergency
department with fever,
dysuria, and back pain. She is diagnosed with pyelonephritis and

however, wants to fight through without antibiotics because itâs going to be a
full moon tonight and that will
certainly give her strength. Her husband arrives at the hospital and wants her to receive antibiotics now. Which of the
following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Administer intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assess the patientâs decision-making capacity</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consult the hospital ethics
committee</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Discharge the patient as per
her right to autonomy</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek a court order giving the husband the legal power to make medical decisions</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a tricky
question because the patientâs autonomy
must absolutely be respected,
however her decision-making capacity should first be determined. This is
not unique to this situation. Any time a patient
is treated, decision-making capacity should be assessed and informed consent
obtained.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since the patient does not want antibiotics, she will be
discharged without them. But before this is
done, her decision-making capacity will still be assessed. It can then
be appropriately documented alongisde that the
patient chose to be discharged against medical advice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a patient refuses medical care, implement patient
education, understanding, and informed consent. Explore reasons behind the refusal. Then document the patientâs refusal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
husbandâs desire for the patient to receive antibiotics is irrelevant. Only if
the patient becomes incapacitated
and he is her durable power of attorney would he have the ability to override
her choice to not receive
antibiotics.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp; A
45-year-old man presents to the clinic for a routine follow-up examination.
Blood pressure has been &gt;150/100
mmHg on his previous three appointments. The physician recommends lisinopril to manage the patientâs hypertension. After
a lengthy discussion, the patient declines medications. This case best describes which of the following ethical
principles?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Autonomy</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beneficence</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Justice</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Morality</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-maleficence</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Autonomy
refers to a patientâs ability to accept or refuse medical treatment. It is very
rare for interventions to be made against patientsâ
wishes, even if decision-making capacity is dubious.
In this case, the patient has
elected not to take the recommended medication, thereby exercising his right to autonomy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Beneficence
refers to the physicianâs duty to do what is best for the patient. âBestâ may
be derived from a combination of the
physicianâs judgment and the patientâs wishes. In this case, the physicianâs desire to prescribe an ACE
inhibitor is acting out of beneficence â i.e., he is recommending what he believes is best for the patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Non-maleficence
refers to not doing harm to a patient. An example would be reducing a patientâs unnecessary polypharmacy. Another example
would be to refuse to provide certain treatments or interventions (e.g., prescribing high-dose iron tablets instead
of an ACE inhibitor because the patient has heard iron is beneficial).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Justice refers to fairness in resource distribution, where patients in similar
situations should have the same access to care.</div>"

to speak alone with the physician briefly. His
parents acquiesce. Once in private, the boy says, âLook, I know my parents just want whatâs best for
me and theyâre looking out for me. These types of communications are important and sensitive, I understand. Can
you just be honest with me: am I dying?
I am an adult and bear my own autonomy.â Which of the following is the most
appropriate response by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âAn
inverse relationship is observed between
lymphocyte count and prognosis in your case.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHave you spoken to your parents
about this?â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI cannot discuss your prognosis
with you without
your parents present.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âYou will be okay. These types of things are stressful for your
parents.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âYour
prognosis is not good, no. You must understand your parents are stressed.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a favorite USMLE question. In these types of scenarios where the minor privately confides in the
physician, yet the parents do not want prognosis conveyed, the physicianâs best
response is to ask the child how
communication has been with his or her parents. The discussion should be as open-ended as possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
C does not sound unreasonable, but it is not as ideal as first assessing the
nature and scope of the childâs
communications with his parents. Choice C may place the parents in an uncomfortable position, where the child
may believe information is being hidden
from him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
D would be lying to the patient.</div>

<div>Choice E is wrong because parents
have the right to refuse their children being aware
of prognosis.</div>"

<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask

overrule the wishes of the patient</div>

<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do

<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seek a court order to do the surgery</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Refer the case
to the hospital ethics committee</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients
have the legal right to refuse treatment even if it is life-saving. The patient
was fully informed and competent at
the time when he made it clear he did not wish to have surgery. His wishes
need to be respected as per the ethical principle of autonomy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When the patient is incapacitated and his wishes
are not known, his next of kin can act as surrogate decision makers (spouse before adult children). In this case, the
patientâs wishes are known.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Referring
the case to the hospital ethics committee or the courts would be inappropriate.
The hospital ethics committee can get
involved when the patientâs wishes are not known and the family members
disagree on what course of
action the patient
would choose.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As
discussed earlier, if the patient has a durable power of attorney, then if the
patient becomes incapacitated, the
wishes of the durable power of attorney must be followed, even if the patient stated views to the contrary

USMLE will sometimes ask questions
that seemingly have two âcorrectâ answers. Choice C is not wrong in the sense that the physician must not perform
an ELISA on a patient who refuses. However prior to fulfilling the patientâs wishes, out of the principle of
beneficence, the physician must first explain
the purpose of the ELISA test and document
the patientâs rationale for declining the test.</div>

possibility of an HIV PCR test may be explored for the patient, but not before
first explaining the purpose of the ELISA screening test.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do
not perform the surgery</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtain an emergency obstetric consult</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform the surgery while
maintaining care and supervision of the patient</div>
<div>E) Send the patient to emergency theater and immediately transfer
care to obstetrics</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
fetus is legally considered part of a womanâs body. Even if the fetus is term
and could be delivered safely, this
patient has refused surgical intervention and her wishes must be respected. She should be resuscitated to the best
efforts of the physician team, but surgery cannot be performed since she rejected it. Autonomy must be respected.</div>

<div>If
the mother becomes deceased and the fetus is still viable, surgery may be
performed to save the fetus. However
if the mother is alive and has refused surgery, the fetus is considered part of
her body and, once again, her autonomy for no surgical
intervention must be respected.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âFrom a population health standpoint, we must discuss your testing.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI

<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âLetâs arrange a follow-up.â</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
physician should communicate that he or she understands, and then let the
patient know that she can return
to the clinic at any time
to receive the results.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients
have the right to refuse information just like they have the right to refuse
testing or treatment. They do not
need to provide justification for their desire to not hear information. Their wishes must be accepted. Learning about a
potential gene mutation one might have does not necessitate mandatory disclosure from any type of public health standpoint.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In
the event the patient has a communicable disease of public health
significance (i.e., HIV, hepatitis
C, etc.), the patient must be informed of his or her diagnosis in order to
prevent community spread.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients
can also request information be shared with someone else as opposed to directly
receiving the news themselves. This
possibility can be discussed with the patient, but not before communicating an understanding for the
patientâs wishes.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Patients
can leave clinical trials at any point without the need to provide any line of
justification. The decision
of the patient must be respected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
USMLE will often have many similar-sounding answers that donât seem
unreasonable, but the ethics
learning point here is that a patient has the autonomy to leave a study/trial,
period. A discussion about the
trial may be engaged upon if the patient
voluntarily and willingly discusses his or her thoughts. But if he or she
communicates a desire to leave, albeit a terse justification or not, it
must be respected.</div>"

answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dialysis
is considered life-extending treatment. It is also very costly and
time-consuming to undergo. It is rare
for hospice arrangements to include any type of dialysis as it is not
considered a mere end-of-life comfort measure.</div>

eligibility criteria for hospice care are that the patient is terminally ill
within six months and is not pursuing
any type of life-prolonging management.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Palliative
care may be explored as an option in which dialysis can be pursued. At this
moment, asking the patient about his
understanding of palliative versus hospice care, the latter which would require the cessation of his dialysis, is
inappropriate, as the patient has already voiced that he wishes to remain
on dialysis.</div>

with cholecystitis and surgery is recommended. The procedure is explained and the patient agrees to it. However, when
the physician brings the form for her to sign, the patient says that she comes from a very religious
household and that her husband needs to sign the form for her because women in her family traditionally never sign anything.
The husband is willing to do it. Which of the
following is the most appropriate
action by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
more about the patientâs cultural and religious
beliefs</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the husband to allow his wife
to sign the form</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Consult the hospital chaplain</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Document the patientâs refusal to sign and allow the husband
to sign</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Document the patientâs verbal consent and proceed with planned management</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Written
consent is not essential. Verbal consent, while more difficult to prove, is equally
valid. A second witness to oral
consent is highly advisable in case it is ever brought into question. This patient has consented to the procedure.
She is legally competent to make healthcare decisions so there is no need for surrogate decision-making or contacting the
hospital chaplain. Every attempt should
be made to provide culturally sensitive care to patients and demanding a
signature would be inappropriate.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although asking more
about the patientâs cultural and religious beliefs
may be appropriate in some settings (e.g., if the patient asks about
unusual or alternative therapies), in this case, acquiring verbal
consent is acceptable.</div>"
"<div>A
physician is asked to deliver a presentation on a novel agent sponsored by a
pharmaceutical company. The physician
accepts the invitation. The company offers to prepare a poster for the presentation, provide monetary
compensation to the physician, and cover the travel costs of all attendees. Which of the following is considered ethically acceptable?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All
of the above</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation for the lecturing physician and the travel expenses of the attendees</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compensation for the lecturing physician only</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel expenses of the attendees only</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel expenses of the attendees and the cost of the poster production</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is permissible for physicians invited to deliver presentations to be
compensated for their time and
reimbursed for travel costs. Full disclosure of any financial ties between the
company and lecturer is essential. Moreover, if the
physician participated in any way in the research project,
this also needs to be disclosed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is not permissible to receive travel reimbursements for merely attending, but
not presenting at, conferences, as
this may preclude the ability of healthcare professionals to make impartial assessments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is important to remember is that the content of such presentations needs to be
decided solely by the physician
delivering the lecture. The pharmaceutical company should not be influencing
the content (i.e., by providing slides or lecture
notes).</div>"
"<div>A
physician is attending a large cardiology conference sponsored by the
pharmaceutical industry. A number of
practitioners from different parts of the world are presenting their research. Inexpensive lunch is provided to all
attendees. Everyone is also given a stethoscope. At the end of the day, one randomly chosen attendee is
offered a one-week holiday in Hawaii, and the physician is notified that he is the winner. Which of the following is
the most appropriate response by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHawaii? Why not Barbados?â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI
cannot accept the holiday.â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âI
am unsure and would like to discuss the nature of this prize
with the medical
board first.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThank you.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âWhat more do I need to know before accepting this gift?â</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
issue of accepting gifts from pharmaceutical companies is complicated. It is
generally agreed upon that it is
acceptable to take only the smaller gifts that will directly help with patient
care. An example would be educational material on healthy
diets for patients
with hypertension or diabetes. It is also acceptable
to have the meal.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Extravagant
gifts such as a holiday in Hawaii (or Barbados) might function to unduly
influence the physician and would
clearly violate ethical standards. In cases of physicians delivering lectures
at events sponsored by pharmaceutical
companies, the content of the lecture needs to be fully controlled by the physician,
not the company sponsoring the event.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
C does not seem like an unreasonable answer, but this question is tricky in
that physicians should know concretely that such gifts are not acceptable.
In other words, tempting, but no.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp;A
75-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination following
a successful hip surgery. She is
extremely grateful that she is able to walk again and can play with her grandchildren. To express her gratitude,
she brings the physician a basket of oranges she picked up at the grocery store. Which
of the following is the most appropriate
response by the physician?<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThank you for the oranges.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThis was very nice of
you, but I cannot accept gifts from patients.â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThis was very nice of
you, but I cannot accept perishable food items here in the clinic.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âThis was very nice of you, but
I am allergic to oranges.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âThis
was very nice of you. Let me first consult with hospital management about
whether it is okay for me
to accept this gift.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Accepting
gifts from patients is a difficult issue because rejecting a patientâs gift may
leave him or her feeling embarrassed or shameful, inadvertently causing harm to the doctor-patient relationship.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
is generally considered acceptable for the physician to accept low-cost gifts
as per his or her best judgment
(e.g., simple food items or thank-you cards). If gifts are of notable monetary
value however (e.g., sports tickets
or a wristwatch), they must be firmly and politely rejected.</div>"
"<div>&nbsp; While
attending a medical conference, a physician is approached by a colleague.
Following a brief conversation, both
physicians develop a romantic interest in each other. They share a beer
together and have an intimate
encounter. Soon afterward, the colleague reveals to the physician that while she was in medical school, she attended a
resident-run clinic and he treated her for a brief episode of major depression. She assures him that
she is fine now and would like to continue the
interaction. Which of the
following is the correct response?<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âAlright.â</div>

is always inappropriate to date other physicians.â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âIâm sorry,
but we need to end our
interaction.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âSince it was a long
time ago, it is a possibility.
I will consult the ethics
board first.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is always unacceptable to date any current patients
and former psychiatric patients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While
it is generally advisable to avoid dating any former patients, if the patient
had been treated for a
non-psychiatric condition, the relationship would be permissible if the
physician-patient relationship had been terminated at least 6 months to 2 years prior.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There
are no rules against physicians dating other physicians insofar as no ethical
or legal rules are broken (e.g.,
sharing patient information, or inappropriately referring patients between each
other to increase number of visits).</div>"
"<div>&nbsp; A
physician receives a call from his sister, a 45-year-old female with no
significant past medical history who
complains of sleep deprivation. She works as an attorney and has numerous
important cases coming up, the
outcomes of which determine whether she becomes a partner at her law firm. She says that her regular physician has
always been giving her zolpidem but she has been unable to get an appointment on time. To the best of the physicianâs
knowledge, his sister is reliable and has
never abused any substances. She is asking for a single zolpidem prescription
until she can schedule an appointment
with her primary care physician. Which of the following would be the most appropriate
response?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âCan you first show me one of the previous
prescriptions you were given?â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âCan you tell me more
about why you think you need zolpidem
in particular?â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI
canât write this prescription for you.â</div>

is never appropriate.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âYou should make me your
primary care physician first.â</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This question
is âhardâ because
this situation seems
otherwise benign/innocuous, but the correct
answer is that it is unacceptable to write a prescription in this case.
The USMLE wants you to understand when it is important to take a professional hard-line.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Treating
family members and friends is generally discouraged unless it is an emergency
and no other physicians are
available. In this non-urgent case, it would be inappropriate to prescribe medication both because the physicianâs
sister is not his patient and because she may not be completely honest with a
family member.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>She
should instead be encouraged to make an appointment with her current primary
care physician and discuss the concern with him or her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Asking
for additional details is unnecessary as it would still be inappropriate to
prescribe zolpidem regardless.
Naming a family member as oneâs primary care physician can be problematic and should be
avoided.</div>"
"<div>While
on his ICU rotation, a resident notices that one of the attendings has been
sleepy at work. One day, the resident notices
the attending taking a couple

insert a central line, the physician punctures an artery causing a major bleed, necessitating a blood
transfusion for the patient. Apart from this isolated incident, this resident is not aware of any
potential mishaps by the attending. The attending is well- respected amongst his colleagues and is an
esteemed staff member at the hospital. Which of the following is the appropriate
action by the resident?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the attending if he
believes his sleepiness is a concern</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask
the attending if he has been taking
medications to help with wakefulness at work</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No immediate action is needed as this is an isolated
episode</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notify the attending that you will be
reporting the concern</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Report the concern without notifying the attending</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is E.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When
noticing that a physician may be impaired and unable to perform his or her
duties, it is a responsibility of other members
of staff to report it since
their primary duty is to the
patients.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In
this case, it is apparent this attendingâs actions are putting patientsâ
well-being at risk. While the physicianâs
use of benzodiazepines cannot be over-speculated and needs to be appropriately explored, at this point, the most
important intervention is to prevent the physician from harming another
patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
exact practices for reporting impaired colleagues are not consistent across all
healthcare centers and institutions.
Although in many instances colleagues are encouraged to directly discuss concerns with each other, this attending
should be reported, and it is not required that he be notified first.
Anonymous reporting is acceptable and ensures patients
are maximally safe.</div>

<div>The
degree to which the attending is professionally venerated is irrelevant in
terms of the need to be reported.</div>"
"<div>A
30-year-old woman presents to the clinic for the first time to establish care.
She used to see another physician
previously but has decided to change clinics. She has no current complaints.
Her past medical history is
insignificant. The physician proceeds to discuss health maintenance and asks about history of Pap smears. Upon
mentioning them, the patient starts crying. She reveals that the reason she is changing
clinics is because
her previous physician
had been asking her to take off her
clothes frequently during visitations and had been touching her. The previous
physician insisted such examinations
were not out of the ordinary. Which of the following is the most appropriate next best step?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Report the previous physician</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tell the patient that you are concerned and will report
her previous physician</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
previous physician must be reported and the issue explored by the medical
board. The patient does not need to
be notified that you will be making the report. This may also put her in an uncomfortable position since she is attempting to confide
in you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Although
it might sound reasonable to ask further questions so that one can better ascertain whether or not to report the previous
physician, this is not the most appropriate step because the reporting needs to be done regardless. In
other words, the patient has objectively changed clinics and broken down crying saying she was concerned about her
previous physician. This alone warrants reporting.</div>

<div>Some medical errors are not preventable. In this case,

treatment was appropriate in this case.</div>

<div>This would have been both a preventable error and

<div>The

carry minor risks of error (i.e., things can âfall through the holes/cracksâ), when you add up a number of layers of
protection and responsibility (i.e., proper communication and documentation),
it becomes much less likely
that an error will occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

Providing
physicians with computer
databases of drug interactions</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that a pharmacist present on
rounds may lead to a
decreased incidence of prescription errors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additional
measures that lead to decreased incidence of adverse ICU outcomes are having no
more than two patients assigned to
a single nurse and ensuring that an intensivist is present on daily rounds.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Online
databases of drug interactions already exist and can be very useful in clinical
practice, but having a pharmacist
available at all times reduces the incidence of prescription errors more than such databases.</div>"

it was prescribed. He has not brought any medical records with him. Which of the following is the appropriate
next step by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Conduct a psychiatric history</div>

aripiprazole</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Refer the patient back to his previous physician

<div>As
part of any appropriate history and examination, this patient should also have
a psychiatric assessment performed while he is in-office.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After

<div>Haloperidol
can cause extra-pyramidal side-effects, including acute dystonia, akathisia, Parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Stopping a typical

slowed and that he has pinpoint pupils. The patient improves after a dose of naloxone. It is later discovered that
he accidentally received double the dosage

step in performing this analysis?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a causal factor flowchart</div>

Implement changes</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generate recommendations</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Measure success
of changes implemented</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Root-cause
analysis is the process of upstream/initial (i.e., root) causes of problems in
order to identify appropriate solutions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Root-cause
analysis adheres to the assumption that it is more effective to systematically
prevent and solve for underlying problems
than it is to just address ad hoc symptoms
after the fact.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Root-cause analysis
consists of 4 steps:</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Collecting data (e.g., how dosages of opioids are administered)</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Creating causal
factor flowcharts (i.e., which events led to the next)</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generating and implementing recommendations (e.g., colored syringes
with dosages)</div>
<div>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Measuring success
of changes implemented (e.g., # of errors
over time)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
hospital has already gathered data on the event, so the next step is to create
a causal flowchart. Once the flowchart
is created and it becomes evident which sequence of events led
to the error, it is appropriate to develop and implement a
plan to prevent similar errors from happening in the future.</div>"

<div>F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Medicare Part D</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is F.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Medicare Part D
helps cover the cost of prescription drugs and some vaccines.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) covers inpatient
services, including hospital stays, care in
skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, and some home
healthcare.</div>

<div>Medicare Part B (medical insurance) covers doctorâs

45-year-old woman presents to her physician for a follow-up appointment after
an elevated blood pressure
reading two weeks ago. Her blood pressure
today is 150/100
and a decision is made to
commence her on amlodipine. Upon calling her insurance provider, the patient is
informed that the insurance will only
begin coverage of costs once she has paid $1,000 out-of-pocket. Which of the following best describes this out-of-pocket expense referred to by the insurance
company?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Coinsurance</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copayment</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Deductible</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Out-of-pocket maximum</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Premium</div>"	"<div>The
correct answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
deductible is the amount of money a patient needs to pay each year before his
or her insurance policy starts
paying. For example, this patientâs $1,000 deductible means that she is
required to cover the first $1,000
dollars of her medical bills before her insurance provider will cover anything.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Coinsurance
is the amount the patient pays to share the cost of the covered treatments
after the deductible is met. For
example, if the treatmentâs total cost is $2,000 and there is a 20% coinsurance, the patient will need to pay
$1,200 â i.e., the $1,000 deductable + 20% of the subsequent insurance payment
($200 is 20% of the second $1,000).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A copayment is a flat fee for some expenses
(e.g., $20 for every doctor visit). A premium is the monthly
fee of the health insurance policy.</div>
<div>An out-of-pocket maximum is the most a patient would have
to pay for the services covered by a plan over the
course of a year.</div>"
"<div>A
40-year-old woman presents to the physician for a routine health maintenance
examination. She begins discussing
problems she has been having in her relationship with her husband. She says she has had thoughts about wanting to have
him killed. The physician probes further, and over the course of ten minutes the patient reveals that she is not
joking. She knows they are not good thoughts
she is having, but she keeps thinking about this idea and might hire someone.
Upon recognizing the seriousness of
the physicianâs demeanor, the patient says, âYou know Iâm joking right. Donât tell me for a second you
thought I was serious.â What is the most appropriate course of action by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Communicate to the
patient you will be contacting law enforcement</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Communicate to the
patient you will be contacting law enforcement and her husband</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Communicate to the
patient you will be contacting her husband</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate to the patient you understand relationships are difficult and will not break
confidentiality</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Communicate to the patient you
understand relationships are difficult and then contact law enforcement</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is C.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If a
physician believes a patient has sincerely conveyed intent to cause serious
harm to a third party, the physician
must break confidentiality and notify the third party. This most saliently applies
(although is not limited to) homicidality and rape.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
âduty to warnâ third parties famously
stems from the 1985 <i>Tarasoff </i>case, where a patient had confided to a psychotherapist murderous
intent, confidentiality was maintained, and then the patient went on to commit murder. California law now encodes the
<i>Tarasoff </i>rule, in which psychotherapists have a legal duty to warn
potential victims of serious harm. States differ as to their exact laws, but the duty to warn is a principle
ubiquitously upheld in the medical profession
since the <i>Tarasoff </i>case.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Law
enforcement does not need to be contacted when mere sentiments/plans have been
conveyed, since no crime has been
committed yet. If a patient has confided that he or she committed serious crime in the past
(e.g., murder, armed robbery),
law enforcement must be
contacted.</div>"
"<div>A
30-year-old woman undergoing outpatient chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma
presents to the physician with
painful vesicular lesions on her back. The physician believes that a one-day inpatient stay with IV acyclovir is most
appropriate, followed by discharging the patient on oral valacyclovir. He is aware the patient has history of
hospitalization and abhors being in hospital.
Which of the following is the most appropriate way to initiate
discussion regarding this patientâs management?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âHere
is oral valacyclovir for your condition.
This way you donât need to be in
hospital.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHow do you feel about entering hospital?â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHow do you feel about receiving IV treatment in outpatient emergency
for the next day?â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âIâd like to
admit you to hospital, but I know youâve
hated that type of thing in the past.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âWeâre going to admit you to hospital for a short stay. Is
that okay with you?â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is B.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A
simple open-ended question assessing the patientâs feelings about entering
hospital is most appropriate. This
exact same type of statement is also used if needing to involuntarily
hospitalize a patient for, e.g.,
suicidality.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>IV
acyclovir is the answer on USMLE for herpes zoster if the patient is
immunocompromised, undergoing chemotherapy, or is toxic (i.e.,
high fever, chills).
If the patient merely
has diabetes mellitus, orals can be given
without the need for admission
to hospital (on NBME).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice A is wrong because this would be violating
non-maleficence â i.e., we would be doing harm to the patient
if not at least offering
the management we best
see fit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
C is wrong because this represents mismanagement of where the patient needs to
be treated. It might seem that this
patient could be harmlessly managed in outpatient emergency, but if a true crisis were to arise and maximal
staff resources were needed elsewhere, that would be doing a disservice to this patient.
Patients should be accommodated in every way possible, but this does not mean improper triage or
location of care.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
D is a good, direct statement. But it is not as ideal as B because it is not an
open-ended question. Choice D might
be appropriate if the patient responds to B by saying she does not want to be in hospital. Now the physician
needs to directly communicate his thoughts about admitting her.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice E suggests an involuntary hospitalization is
ensuing. This would be an acceptable answer
after choice B if the patient needed to be admitted for, e.g., suicidality.</div>"
"<div>A

following would be the
most appropriate response by the physician?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âAs
your physician I have to tell you that these supplements are insufficiently regulated.â</div>
<div>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âHerbal supplements are, unfortunately, ineffective against major depression.â</div>
<div>C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
âHow
have you been feeling since
starting the supplement?â</div>
<div>D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âI want you to find out for me as soon as possible what kind of supplement it is.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âLetâs see how we can be work the herbal supplement in with our other treatments.â</div>"	"<div>The correct answer is D.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a âhardâ question.</div>
<div>The combination of St John Wort and SSRIs can lead to
serotonin syndrome. It is urgent to know what kind of supplement the patient has started so that an adverse outcome
can be prevented.</div>
<div>Patients
who commence anti-depressants will certainly be counseled beforehand about the
dangers of taking concurrent herbal
supplements, however this patient just began taking an unknown supplement and this needs to be seriously and firmly addressed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
reason this question is hard is because choice E is often a correct answer when
patients begin alternative or
cultural remedies in non-urgent settings. For instance, if an immigrant patient
is not taking an SSRI and wants to
add âelk bone marrow powderâ to her daily routine, this should not be outright rejected, but instead attempts
should be made to facilitate the incorporation of cultural remedies
into the patientâs care.</div>

the patient could feel perfectly
fine right now but then develop an adverse
reaction later. This does not directly address the underlying issue that the

appropriate way to address the situation with the
patient?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âCan you tell me more about this spirit?
I want to understand your thoughts here.â</div>

doing to help your child.â</div>
<div>E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âSometimes we might attribute illness to things that really are not extant.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is D.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This child
needs oral amoxicillin irrespective of the motherâs
belief about the spirit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It
must be understood that patients of different cultural and religious
backgrounds will sometimes carry
beliefs not shared by the physician. Patients and their families should not
have their views on alternative
remedies outright rejected. If the remedies are otherwise harmless, the
physician should discuss how the
remedy and necessary treatment can be worked in together. (This is similar to Choice
E of question 82)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If
the patient wishes to incorporate a remedy the physician knows little about, he
or she can do research on the remedy
(i.e., literally searching on Google) while the patient is there in order to develop a plan. This is because the aim
is to be sensitive, and not immediately dismissive of, cultural beliefs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choice
C sounds reasonable and is appropriate as an isolated statement. But D is
superior because it implies an
acceptance of the motherâs beliefs (i.e., it doesnât deny or refute them) while
also addressing the important management of the child.</div>

understanding of cultural beliefs. Choice E is patronizing and verbose.</div>"

autism.â</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is A.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The parents
have firmly stated that they do not wish to discuss
this further. They have their beliefs and these must be respected. Forcing
unwanted communication in this setting can damage the doctor-patient relationship. Parents have the right to refuse
vaccines for their kids, even though population
health data is overwhelmingly conclusive as to the benefits. In addition,
vaccines do not cause autism.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
parentsâ refusal should be documented. This documentation in and of itself does
not need to be communicated to the
parents (choice A), but the reason this is correct over choice C is because the parents are made
aware that if they change
their mind, they can still access
appropriate care for their
children without an issue.</div>

<div>In
order to establish healthy sleep hygiene, patients should be told to try to get
up at the same time every day, even if it is difficult to do so and they feel tired.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The
result is they may be more inclined to go to bed earlier in the evening, which
in turn will make getting

do not need to be checked in this girl as she is otherwise developing fine. It
is high- yield to know that once a
girl reaches Tanner stage 3, menarche is imminent (this is a direct answer on a 2CK obgyn NBME). The USMLE
will frequently trap students into choosing answers relating to âcheck hormones,â when in reality observation is

<div>The idea behind screening is to identify early cases of a

screening test it needs to identify almost all individuals affected by a
condition. As such, it is important that screening tests have the lowest possible false negative rate. The false positive rate is of lesser concern as
individuals identified by screening tests can be further assessed by tests with higher specificity to confirm the
diagnosis. Positive and negative predicted
value tell us what proportion of positive and negative tests are true positives/negatives. Accurate tests are
the ones that produce results that are close to the real value, while precise

explanation of the finding:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; selection bias</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; measurement bias</div>

<div>e)&nbsp; confounding</div>"	"<div>
<div><br></div>
<div>The correct
answer is d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Lead-time bias refers to apparent survival increase due
to earlier disease detection without any change in disease course.
ALS is an incurable disease
with very limited treatment options. Early</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>treatment would be unlikely to alter the disease course.
Selection bias refers to nonrandom sampling
of study participants. Measurement bias would be present if there was an issue
with the way a variable
was measured (eg, faulty equipment). Length-time bias refers to the tendency
of screening tests to detect diseases with longer latency periods (eg, the
window in which a slowly-progressive
lymphoma that may have a latency period of a many years can be diagnosed is far larger than the one for
rapidly-progressive lymphomas). Confounders are external variables that may affect the outcome. For example, if
heroin users were more likely to be
alcoholics, it could be determined that alcoholic liver disease is more common
among heroin users and lead to the conclusion that heroin causes
alcoholic liver disease.</div>"

the requirement:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; Streptococcal pharyngitis</div>

<div>c)&nbsp; HIV</div>
<div>d)&nbsp; Schizophrenia</div>
<div>e)&nbsp; Carpal tunnel syndrome</div>"	"<div>The correct

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disease prevalence refers to the number of people
affected by the condition, while disease incidence
refers to the number of newly diagnosed cases. Therefore, in order for those
two values to be close to each other,
it is essential that the disease duration is short. Almost all patients recover from Streptococcal
pharyngitis in the same year they develop the disease, making the prevalence and incidence very closely aligned.
Schizophrenia, carpal tunnel syndrome,
aortic stenosis and HIV are all chronic conditions and once patients are
diagnosed they generally remain
affected for life (unless, for example, carpal tunnel syndrome is treated surgically). While incidence of those
conditions may remain stable, with each passing year, the prevalence of the disease increases as
previously diagnosed patients remain affected and new cases are diagnosed.</div>"

<div>Case fatality rate is the percentage of patients who die

survive the condition, the most
valuable piece of information is the percentage of patients affected who end up dying, which is the case fatality
rate. Relative risk is the risk of developing a disease among patients exposed to a risk factor divided
by the risk in the unexposed (eg, it tells us that smokers are a

exposed and a group unexposed to a risk factor. Biased studies are those where

Which of the following most likely explains the finding:<br></div></div><div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; smoking is not a
risk factor for coronary disease</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; Berkson bias</div>
<div>c)&nbsp; observer bias</div>
</div>
<div>d)&nbsp; recall bias</div>
<div>e)&nbsp; Hawthorne effect</div>"	"<div>&nbsp;The correct
answer is e.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hawthorn effect refers to a behavioral change in
participants who know they are being followed.
In this case it is possible that patients who were followed stopped smoking or decreased the amount they smoked. Smoking
is a known risk factor for coronary disease development.
Observer bias could explain the finding if the researchers strongly believed
that there was no association between
the two and if such belief affected the way they interpreted the results. In this case, the likelihood
that the participants simply changed their behavior in responds to being followed is higher. Recall bias is a term used
to describe the phenomenon where
people who develop a condition tend to overreport exposure to a risk factor
that is being studied compared to
controls. This study does not depend on the participantsâ recall of risk factor exposure. Berkson bias refers to
the tendency of hospitalized patients to be less healthy and have different exposures when compared to the general
population. The participants in this study were not necessarily hospitalized patients.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The idea behind screening is to identify almost all
individuals affected by a condition. The number
of false positive is of lesser concern in this case as the final diagnosis can
be confirmed with more specific
tests later on. Precision refers to how close to each other the results of the same test are. The number needed to treat
describes the impact of an intervention or exposure in cohort studies.</div>"
"<div>A retrospective cohort study was done to

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; it cannot be concluded that long-term ibuprofen

<div>b)&nbsp; long-term ibuprofen

<div>c)&nbsp; long-term ibuprofen use is
likely to be protective

<div>d)&nbsp; in some patients long-term ibuprofen use may
decrease, while in others it may increase the
risk of stomach cancer</div>
<div>e)&nbsp; there is stronger evidence in favor of
long-term ibuprofen use causing stomach cancer than not causing it</div>"	"<div>
<div>&nbsp;The correct
answer is a.</div>
</div>
<br>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The relative risk of 1 implies that there is no
association between long-term ibuprofen use and stomach cancer development. In order for results of a clinical
study to be considered significant, the
value 1 must not fall within the confidence interval as that would mean that
there is &lt;5% chance of there
being no association. The RR values above 1 indicate that the factor that is being studied is
associated with an increased incidence of the condition being studied, while values below 1 indicate that the opposite.
In order for either of those conclusions to be reached, the entirety of the confidence interval must fall on the same side
of the value 1.</div>"
"<div>A clinical study was done to assess
the response to a novel

0.9-2.6 mmHg). Despite the findings, the drug has not replaced amlodipine as
the preferred treatment. Which of
the following explains the likely rationale
behind such decision:<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; the results are not
statistically significant</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; the results are statistically but not clinically significant</div>
<div>c)&nbsp; the study has not addressed enough parameters to be relevant</div>
<div>d)&nbsp; the drug needs to undergo more phases
of a clinical trial</div>
<div>e)&nbsp; the decision not to replace
amlodipine was wrong</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is b.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is important to understand the difference between
clinical and statistical significance. In this
case, the confidence interval does not contain the value 0. Therefore,
the results have reached statistical significance and the new drug does reduce blood pressure
more than amlodipine.</div>
<div>However, the blood pressure decrease of 2.3 mmHg is
unlikely to lead to clinically improved outcomes.

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; the sensitivity of the test is higher for patient A</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; the specificity of the test is higher for patient A</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sensitivity and specificity are integral features of a
diagnostic test and they do not depend on any
external variables. Sensitivity is the likelihood that a person affected by a
condition tests positive, while
specificity is the likelihood that a healthy person tests negative. Positive
and negative predictive values, on
the other hand, do depend on external variables, such as disease prevalence in a certain population. Prevalence of lung
cancer is much higher among 75-year-old smokers with family history of lung
cancer than it is among 25-year-old non-smokers with no such family history.
Therefore, the positive predictive value of
the test is higher in patient A.</div>"

<div>The appropriate order of tests is from more sensitive to
more specific tests. Sensitive tests have very low rates of false negatives, whereas
specific tests have low rates of false positives. That is why sensitive tests are good for
screening, while specific tests are used for confirmation. In this case, test 3 is the most sensitive and

Which of the following is a possible explanation of the discrepancy:<br></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; the relationship between
alcohol use and liver cirrhosis has changed recently</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; the previously accepted theories
could be wrong</div>
<div>c)&nbsp; there may be more than one association between the variables</div>
<div>d)&nbsp; the researcher used low-quality studies for his meta-analysis</div>
<div>e)&nbsp; the power of meta-analysis is often low</div>"	"<div>The correct
answer is d.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The quality of the meta-analysis depends on the quality
of the individual studies being used. If the
studies that are chosen are biased or have other systemic problems, the
findings in the meta- analysis will
also be affected. The relationship between alcohol and liver disease does not change over time. Considering how deeply
the relationship has been studied in the past, it is also extremely unlikely that all the previous findings were
wrong. One of the main advantages of
meta-analyses over any other types of clinical research is that their power
tends to be much higher as they
pool data (and subjects) from a number
of different studies.</div>"

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; the number of false positives would not change</div>
<div>b)&nbsp; the number of false

<div>Larger lesions are more likely to be malignant.
Increasing the cut-off value to 3 cm, would likely result
in a higher number of false negatives as any cancers
that are between 2 and 3 cm in size

answer is a.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Increasing the cut-off value means that for those who test positive, the
likelihood of the lesion being malignant would be higher.
Sensitivity would decrease as a number of affected patients with lesions between 2 and 3 cm in size
would be missed. The way a test result is interpreted has no bearing on the incidence of the disease. A way to
decrease incidence would be to decrease public
exposure to risk factors (eg, smoking cessation
programs).</div>"

<div>Ulcerative colitis has two distinctive peak as far as age
distribution goes. It tends to occur either
in young adults or in the elderly. Relatively few people develop
ulcerative colitis in the middle age. Positively skewed distributions are the

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sensitivity and specificity are inherent properties of a
diagnostic test and they do not depend on the prevalence of the disease in population. Sensitivity of the test is the probability that a person affected by a condition tests positive.
In an ideal scenario, a sensitivity of 100% would indicate that everyone affected by a condition
would get a positive test result. Positive and negative predictive value of the test, on the other hand, do depend on
the prevalence of the disease in question.
They indicate what the likelihood is that someone who tests positive or
negative, respectively, is or is not
affected by the condition, respectively. For diseases with relatively low prevalence, the negative predictive value of a test is
high, meaning that people who test negative
are very likely not to be have the
disease.</div></div>"

develops. Observer bias occurs when the researcherâs strong belief in the existence or non-existence of an
association affects the way the data is analyzed. Lead-time
bias refers to the
appearance of improved survival due to earlier
detection of disease without
actually altering its course. Length-time bias refers to the tendency of screening

<div>Patients with asplenia / sickle cell have increased risk of infections due to encapsulated organisms. This namely refers to <em>S. pneumo</em>,&nbsp;<em>H. influenzae</em> type B, and&nbsp;<em>N. meningitidis</em>, which all have polysaccharide capsules. This is because encapsulated organisms require opsonization (with C3b or IgG) and phagocytosis for clearance, and the spleen is where we have 50% of the immune system's reservoir of macrophages. So if we lose the spleen, we lose substantial phagocytic capacity. Patients must receive additional rounds of vaccination against these three organisms.</div><div><br></div><div>If USMLE asks which organism we are most worried about when we give penicillin prophylaxis to sickle cell patients (or any asplenia patient for that matter), the answer is&nbsp;<em>S. pneumo</em>.

What is an important point about sensitivity of arthrocentesis for organisms, especially gonococcus?	Gonococcus is notoriously difficult to culture in patients who have arthritis but no overt urethritis. That is, the patient may have a negative arthrocentesis and throat/urethral swabs. So the diagnosis of arthritis is often made clinically. If the Q mentions papules/pustules on the skin, this makes it hyper-obvious for <em>Gonorrhea</em>. I mention this because occasionally an NBME Q will say the arthrocentesis is negative, and this somehow confuses students. But arthrocentesis is not very sensitive for organisms in the setting of septic arthritis. This can apply to <em>S. aureus</em> as well (I've seen this on NBME), but false-negative results for gonococcus are notably common, so don't be thrown off by that.

Why can't a vaccine be made against&nbsp;<em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> but one can be made against&nbsp;<em>N. meningitidis</em>?

Causes mononucleosis, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, oral hairy leukoplakia, and both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin (notably Burkitt) lymphomas.	What are five conditions EBV causes?
In mononucleosis, EBV invades which types of cells?	The virus invades B cells, which then stimulates the immune system to produce CD8+ T cells attacking the viral-infected B cells. In mono, these CD8+ T cells are called âatypical lymphocytes.â The USMLE wants you to know these are&nbsp;<strong>reactive CD8+ T cells.&nbsp;</strong>They are âreactiveâ because they are responding to the viral-infected B cells.

What are two ways CMV mono can be differentiated from EBV mono?	CMV mono is differentiated from EBV mono in that the former has a negative heterophile antibody (Monospot) test. Additionally, CMV can cause cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia due to the production of IgM antibodies against RBCs, with a positive Coombs test (means we have antibodies against RBCs). So if patient with mono has low hemoglobin and high LDH, for instance, that could point toward CMV over EBV. High LDH on USMLE almost always means hemolysis, since RBCs are packed with LDH.

How do we prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to fetus?	To prevent vertical transmission, the most important measure to take is HAART therapy while pregnant + keeping the mother's viral load as low as possible. She will then receive intrapartum zidovudine, C-section is performed, and then the neonate will receive 6 weeks of zidovudine commenced within 12 hours of birth. Some students will get pedantic about various alternative/updated regimens for neonates, but one of the NBMEs assesses this point about 6 weeks of zidovudine commenced within 12 hours of birth.

Which type of leukocyte (WBC) is increased in helminth infections?	Eosinophils can classically be elevated in helminth infections. This is because eosinophils play a role in killing helminths via release of major basic protein. Normally eosinophils should be &lt;5%. In helminth infections, they can be &gt;6-8%. Questions where eosinophils are, e.g., 15-20% would be considered flamingly obvious and pass-level.
