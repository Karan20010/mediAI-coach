This patient who has recurrent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea with CT evidence of bowel
wall thickening in the distal colon and rectum likely has ulcerative colitis. Chronic inflammatory
conditions are characterized by the persistent stimulation of neutrophils and macrophages,
leading to long-term elevation of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6,
tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon-gamma. The liver responds to these circulating
cytokines (particularly IL-6) by generating acute phase reactants, proteins that modulate and
influence the inflammatory response and play some role in innate immunity.

Testing for acute phase reactants can help diagnose and track conditions associated with
inflammation, including infections, autoimmune diseases, and malignancies. The test
described in this case is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which begins by placing
whole blood in a narrow vertical tube. Erythrocytes settle at the bottom of the tube over time
due to gravity as their density is greater than plasma. ESR is a measure of the length of
plasma on top of the erythrocyte sediment layer at 1 hour. The presence of acute phase
reactants, particularly fibrinogen and globulins, causes erythrocytes to overcome their zeta
potential (negative charge that separates them) and form a stacked, rouleaux formation,
which settles to the bottom of the tube more quickly and increases ESR.

(Choice A) Bradykinin is a component of the kinin system. It is a short-lived peptide that
