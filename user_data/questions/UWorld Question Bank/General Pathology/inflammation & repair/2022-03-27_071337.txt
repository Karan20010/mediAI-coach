¢ Epithelization: Basal keratinocyte proliferation and migration of new epithelial cells form
a new superficial epithelial layer that acts as a barrier to bacteria.

¢ Fibroplasia: Fibroblasts proliferate and synthesize ground substance and collagen,
forming a matrix into which capillaries can grow. Simultaneous contraction of
myofibroblasts (ie, differentiated fibroblasts that produce contractile proteins) helps
decrease the wound size.

¢ Angiogenesis: Proliferation and migration of endothelial cells from nearby blood vessels
lead to ingrowth of new capillaries into the collagen matrix.

Maturation, the final phase of wound healing, results in collagen remodeling and cross-
linking, which are the primary mechanisms by which the tensile strength of the wound
increases.

Educational objective:

Wounds typically heal according to an organized sequence of 4 phases: hemostasis (fibrin clot
formation), inflammation (cellular infiltration), proliferation (reepithelization, fibroplasia, and
angiogenesis), and maturation (collagen remodeling).
