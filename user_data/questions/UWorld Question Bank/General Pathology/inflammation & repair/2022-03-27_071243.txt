Educational objective:

Chronic inflammation is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg,
IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which stimulates the liver to release acute-phase
reactants (eg, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen). The presence of acute-phase reactants
increases the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, a nonspecific marker for inflammation.
