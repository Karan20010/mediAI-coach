relatives.

With HNPCC, there is an inherited mutation in one of the genes responsible for DNA
mismatch repair (eg, MSH2, MLH7). The products of these genes proofread DNA during
replication. Patients with HNPCC inherit a mutation in an allele, and mutation of the second
allele occurs during adult life. When 2 dysfunctional copies are present, malignancies will
develop readily.

(Choice A) The APC gene is responsible for intercellular attachment. Its mutation leads to
the formation of adenomatous polyps from normal mucosa. APC mutation is detected in most
sporadic colon cancers and in all familial polyposis syndromes but not in HNPCC.

(Choice B) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA are classically associated with

breast and ovarian cancers.

(Choice C) MEN7 mutations are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1
syndrome (parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreatic adenomas).

(Choice E) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene VHL are classically associated with von
Hippel-Lindau syndrome (hemangioblastoma, clear cell renal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma).
