This young patient has evidence of multiple adenomas on histopathologic examination of the
colon, raising strong suspicion for the autosomal dominant disorder familial adenomatous
polyposis (FAP). Patients with FAP usually develop innumerable colonic polyps in the
second or third decade of life. The lifetime risk that 21 of these polyps will transform to
invasive colon cancer is nearly 100%. Therefore, prophylactic colectomy is usually advised.

FAP is caused by a germline mutation in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis
coli (APC). Although it is an autosomal dominant disorder, a spontaneous mutation to the
other (wild-type) APC gene is required for expression (which usually occurs in the patient's
teens or twenties). APC encodes for a protein that degrades beta-catenin. Loss of function
of the APC protein increases cellular concentrations of beta-catenin, which activates
transcriptional proteins that lead to intestinal crypt hyperproliferation; accumulation of

subsequent mutations leads to development of polyps.

APC plays a crucial role in generation of both hereditary and spontaneous forms of colon
cancer. Nearly 80% of spontaneous colon cancer has spontaneous mutations to both sets of
APC genes; the remainder typically has activating mutations to downstream products of the
APC pathway.

(Choice A) RAS oncogene mutations lead to constitutively active growth signal transduction.
