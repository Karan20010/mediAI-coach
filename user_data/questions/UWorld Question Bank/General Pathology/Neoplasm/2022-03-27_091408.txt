(Choice A) Activating mutations of BRAF are responsible for most cases of hairy cell

leukemia, a B-cell neoplasm that typically presents in older patients with pancytopenia,
splenomegaly, and systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, recurrent infections). It is also present in

many cases of malignant melanoma.

(Choice B) HER2, an oncogene encoding for an epidermal growth factor receptor, is amplified
or overexpressed in many forms of invasive breast cancer. Treatment of the HER2 gene
product can improve outcomes in these individuals.

(Choice C) Activating mutations in the KRAS proto-oncogene are common in colorectal
cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. KRAS encodes for a GTPase that relays cellular
growth and proliferation signals from outside the cell.

(Choice E) Germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene cause multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 2, which is associated with pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid cancer,
parathyroid hyperplasia, and/or mucosal neuromas.
