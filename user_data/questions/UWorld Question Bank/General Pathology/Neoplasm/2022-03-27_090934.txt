(Choices B and E) The production of keratin pearls by skin tumor cells is an example of

dysplasia (ie, disordered growth). The fact that they produce keratin means that the tumor

cells are well differentiated. Bronchial epithelial cells can also produce keratin pearls after

undergoing a phenotypic switch from columnar epithelium to squamous epithelium. The

process of switching from one differentiated cell type to another is known as metaplasia and

often occurs in response to irritants (eg, tobacco smoke or gastric acid).

(Choices C and D) Cells in the colon normally form goblet cell-containing glands and cells in
hepatic tissue normally synthesize bile. Therefore, the described tumor cells would be well-

differentiated, not anaplastic.

Educational objective:

Undifferentiated (anaplastic) tumors bear no resemblance to the tissue of origin. They are
composed of pleomorphic cells with large, hyperchromatic nuclei that grow in a disorganized
fashion. Anaplastic tumors may also contain numerous, abnormal mitoses and giant tumor

cells.
