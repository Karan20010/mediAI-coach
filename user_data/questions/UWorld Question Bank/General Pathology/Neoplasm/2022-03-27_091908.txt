Most breast cancer cases occur sporadically in women age >50. Hereditary breast cancer
should be suspected in patients diagnosed at a young age, patients with 22 primary breast
and/or ovarian cancers, and individuals with multiple family members affected by early-onset
breast or ovarian cancer. Most cases of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer are associated
with mutations in the tumor suppressor genes BRCA1 and BRCA2. Tumor suppressor genes

are involved in multiple processes, including:

¢ DNA repair

¢ Cellular differentiation

¢ Checkpoint control of the cell cycle
¢ Transcription factor regulation

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in repair of double-stranded DNA breaks. Mutations in
BRCA1 and BRCA2 result in genetic instability, predisposing cells to an increased risk of
malignant transformation. Both BRCA mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant
manner with variable penetrance. Affected women have a 70%-80% lifetime risk for
developing breast cancer. Moreover, their lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is also
increased by up to 40%, although the BRCA2 gene is less likely to lead to ovarian cancer.

(Choice A) Angiogenesis is an essential factor in the growth of tumors due to their rapid rate
