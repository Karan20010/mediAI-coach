When the humidity and temperature are favorable, STE strains of the fungi Aspergillus
flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus grow on foods such as corn, soybeans, and peanuts,
producing aflatoxins as a byproduct. These aflatoxins are categorized as A1, B2, G1, and G2,
with aflatoxin B1 the most common and most toxic.

High levels of dietary aflatoxin intake have been strongly associated with hepatocellular
carcinoma. In certain areas within Asia and Africa where aflatoxin B1 exposure is high, p53
mutations have been identified in most individuals who developed hepatocellular carcinoma.
More than 90% of these aflatoxin-induced p53 mutations are a classic G:C — T:A transversion
in codon 249. In addition, research suggests that the combination of chronic aflatoxin
exposure and hepatitis B infection significantly increases the risk of developing hepatocellular

carcinoma.

(Choices A, B, C, E, F, G, and H) Lung cancer, infectious diarrhea, dilated cardiomyopathy,
congenital heart defects, hypothyroidism, osteoporosis, and pancreatic cancer are not
associated with aflatoxin-induced mutation of the p53 gene.

Educational Objective:
High levels of dietary aflatoxin exposure is associated with a G:C — T:A transversion in codon
249 of the p53 gene, a mutation thought to greatly increase the risk of developing
