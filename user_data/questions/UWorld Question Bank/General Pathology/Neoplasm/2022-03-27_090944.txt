A 47-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, comes to the office after noticing a pea-sized ump in
her right breast while taking a shower. Her medical history is significant for 3 pack-years of
cigarette use during her 20s. She underwent infertility treatment and in vitro fertilization for
both of her pregnancies. The patient has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer. A
clinical breast examination confirms the presence of a firm, fixed nodule in the right breast with
a small patch of overlying puckered skin. Mammogram findings are highly suspicious for
malignancy, and a needle biopsy reveals infiltrating ductal carcinoma. A right mastectomy and
axillary lymph node dissection are scheduled. Overexpression of which of the following
markers is most likely to be associated with aggressive disease in this patient?

A. BCL-2 (6%)

B. Estrogen receptor (13%)
YC. HER2 (67%)

D. Mutated p53 (11%)

E. Progesterone receptor (1%)
