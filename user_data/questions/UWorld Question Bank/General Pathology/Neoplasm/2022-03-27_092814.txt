mutation allows cells with genomic errors to enter the cell cycle. Such a mutation is
considered the last "hit" in the adenoma to carcinoma sequence (mutations are found in most
colon carcinomas but rarely in adenomas).

(Choice A) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA are classically associated with
breast and ovarian cancers.

(Choice B) Cyclin D is a protein (encoded by CCND7) that regulates cell cycle. Its
overexpression is seen in breast, lung, and esophageal cancers and certain types of
lymphomas.

(Choice C) KRAS protooncogene mutation is responsible for the increase in size of
adenomatous polyps and also leads to uncontrolled cell growth. Such mutations tend to occur
prior to TP53 mutations.

(Choice D) NMYC is an oncogene. An increased number of copies of this gene
(amplification) are seen in neuroblastoma.

(Choice F) Mutation of W77, a tumor suppressor gene, leads to the development of Wilms
tumor.
