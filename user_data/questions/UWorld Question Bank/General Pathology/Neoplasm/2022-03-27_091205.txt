(Choice C) Intercellular binding is mediated by cell surface proteins such as intercellular
adhesion molecules (ICAMs), selectins, and numerous others. Many adhesion proteins,
including ICAMS, also play a role in signal transduction.

(Choice D) Various hormones, cytokines, and other stimuli can induce cytokine release from
a number of cell types. One example of a receptor that induces cytokine release is the Toll-like
receptor, which detects conserved microbial molecular structures.

(Choice E) Clathrin is an intracellular protein that helps form rounded vesicles in the
cytoplasm. Clathrin-coated vesicles help mediate intracellular trafficking and endocytosis.

Educational objective:

The HER2 oncogene encodes for a transmembrane glycoprotein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase
activity and is a member of the family of epidermal growth factor receptors. Overexpression of
this protein is associated with a worse prognosis and increased risk of disease recurrence.
