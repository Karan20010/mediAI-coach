Question 1645 Pratera Next Tutorial Lab Values
This patient's expansile tumor in the distal femur likely indicates osteosarcoma, the most
common primary bone tumor affecting children and young adults. Most cases arise at the
metaphysis of long bones and present with progressive pain and swelling.

Osteosarcomas typically form when a mesenchymal stem cell develops mutations in the
following genes:

¢ RB1 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes for RB, a protein that regulates cell-cycle
progression. Inactivating mutations to RB1 promote unchecked and unregulated cellular
replication and are associated with osteosarcoma, retinoblastoma, melanoma, and soft-
tissue sarcomas.

¢ 7P53 tumor suppressor gene, which encodes for P53, a protein that regulates cell-cycle
progression and maintains genomic integrity by activating DNA repair following damage.
Germ-line mutations to 7P53 are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which
increases the risk for multiple tumors (eg, osteosarcoma, other bone and soft-tissue
sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors, adrenal carcinomas).

(Choice A) Activating mutations of BRAF are responsible for most cases of hairy cell

leukemia, a B-cell neoplasm that typically presents in older patients with pancytopenia,
