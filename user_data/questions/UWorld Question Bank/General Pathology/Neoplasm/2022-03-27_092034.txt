Cachexia is a syndrome that encompasses anorexia, malaise, anemia, weight loss, and
generalized wasting due to underlying systemic disease. Cachexia in this patient is likely a
manifestation of the lung neoplasm revealed on his chest x-ray. Tumor necrosis factor-a
(TNF-a) is a cytokine that causes necrosis of some tumors in vitro and produces symptoms of
cachexia in experimental animals. TNF-a is also called cachectin and is considered a main
mediator of paraneoplastic cachexia (along with interleukin [IL]-18, and IL-6).

TNF-a is produced by macrophages in response to infection as well as by some neoplastic
cells. Its role in cachexia is explained by its influence on the hypothalamus, leading to appetite
suppression. It also increases basal metabolic rate. In bacterial infections, TNF-a produces
fever (along with IL-1), mediates many of the symptoms of septic shock, and causes hepatic
release of acute-phase reactants (eg, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen).

(Choice A) Eaton-Lambert syndrome is a paraneoplastic condition that manifests as
progressive, symmetric proximal muscle weakness (rather than wasting) along with ocular and
autonomic symptoms. It is due to autoantibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels.

(Choice B) Interferon-a is synthesized by leukocytes and has antiviral as well as anti-tumor

activity.
