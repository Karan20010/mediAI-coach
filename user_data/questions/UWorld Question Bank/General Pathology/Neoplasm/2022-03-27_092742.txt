A 65-year-old woman is being evaluated following an episode of syncope that occurred after
prolonged standing. She used to exercise in the local gym but has become easily fatigued
recently. The patient has had occasional dark stools. She has lost 5 kg (11 Ib) in the past few
weeks due to "poor appetite." She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. Family
history is negative for cancers. Vital signs reveal mild orthostatic hypotension. Physical
examination is unremarkable, but stool is positive for occult blood. Colonoscopy reveals 2
polyps. The pathology report shows advanced adenomatous changes in one polyp and
adenocarcinoma in the other. A mutation in which of the following genes is most likely
responsible for the transformation from advanced adenoma to adenocarcinoma in this patient?
