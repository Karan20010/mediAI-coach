the microscope (eg, pleomorphic cells with enlarged nuclei, scant cytoplasm, prominent
nucleoli, and lack of keratinization). In other tumor types, architectural features (eg, gland
formation in adenocarcinoma) or the number of mitotic figures may be part of the grading
criteria.

Tumor stage is a marker of degree of spread. Low stage is seen when the tumor remains
confined to the site of origin (eg, forearm skin); a higher stage is seen when there is regional
(eg, lymph node) or distant (eg, lung) spread. In this case, the absence of regional
lymphadenopathy on examination and distant metastases (eg, bone, lung, liver) on PET/CT
indicates a low stage of disease. Perineural invasion (ie, tumor invasion into the space
surrounding a nerve), which is likely present in this patient, is considered a high-risk feature for
metastasis but is not, by itself, considered metastatic disease.

Educational objective:

Tumor grade describes how much a tumor's cells resemble normal, mature cells of their type
and estimates the cells' likely aggressiveness. Tumor stage is a marker of a tumor's degree of
spread; regional lymph node involvement or distant metastases indicate a higher stage of
disease.
