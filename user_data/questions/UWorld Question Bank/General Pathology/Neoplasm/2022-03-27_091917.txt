of division and high metabolic demands. Although they stimulate angiogenesis by increasing
production of substances such as vascular endothelial growth factor, tumors frequently

outgrow their blood supply and become necrotic in the center.

(Choice B) Apoptosis refers to programmed cell death in response to irreparably damaged
DNA or misfolded proteins. Malignant cells in chronic lymphocytic lymphoma upregulate the
protooncogene BCL2, which stabilizes the mitochondrial membrane, thereby preventing
cytochrome C leakage, caspase activation, and apoptotic death.

(Choice D) Intercellular adhesion is impaired in the majority of malignant tumors, which allows
portions of the tumor to break off and metastasize. Adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin
are also responsible for transduction of growth signals important for normal tissue growth and
regeneration; disruption of intercellular adhesion signaling can promote unchecked cellular
proliferation.

(Choice E) Alarge number of malignancies are associated with aberrant signal transduction.
For example, overexpression of HER2 (a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in growth signal
transduction) causes the development of certain types of aggressive breast cancer. Unlike
BRCA1 and BRCA2, HER2 mutations are acquired, not inherited.
