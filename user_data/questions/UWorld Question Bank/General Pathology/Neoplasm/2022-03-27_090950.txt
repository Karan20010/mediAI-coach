Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also called ERBB2) is a member of the
epidermal growth factor receptor family. It is overexpressed in 20%-30% of breast cancers.
HER2 is a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity that acts to increase cell
proliferation. It is present in diminutive amounts in normal breast and ovarian cells. In breast
cancer, HER2 overexpression (positivity) is associated with poorly differentiated, rapidly
growing tumors. Clinically, HER2 status is used to predict therapeutic response to anti-HER2
monoclonal antibodies (eg, trastuzumab).

(Choice A) Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 protein is classically observed in
follicular lymphomas, but it also occurs in a variety of other malignancies, including breast
cancer. Unlike in lymphomas, increased expression of BCL-2 in breast cancer is associated
with a favorable prognosis.

(Choices B and E) Breast cancers that express high levels of estrogen and/or progesterone
receptors are typically associated with improved outcomes. Activation of these receptors acts
as a stimulus for tumor growth. Therefore, anti-estrogen therapy (eg, aromatase inhibitors,
tamoxifen) is used to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

(Choice D) Overexpression of a mutated form of p53 is found in many human cancers,
