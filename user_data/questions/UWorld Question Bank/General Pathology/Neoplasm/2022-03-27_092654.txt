A 38-year-old man is evaluated for bloody stools, weight loss, and anemia. The patient's past
medical history is unremarkable, and he does not take any medications. He uses tobacco and
drinks alcohol "socially." The patient's father died of colon cancer at age 40. His younger
sister suffers from endometrial cancer. Examination is remarkable for minimal right-sided
abdominal tenderness without guarding to deep palpation. Stool is positive for occult blood.

Colonoscopy shows a right-sided ulcerative colon mass. No polyps are noted. Biopsy of the
mass reveals adenocarcinoma. A mutation in which of the following genes is most likely

responsible for this patient's condition?
