lump a few months ago but thinks it might be getting larger. The patient has a history of right

adrenal tumor, and her younger sister died of leukemia. Examination of the left breast shows a

5-cm, firm immobile mass with irregular borders. Which of the following gene mutations is the

most likely etiology for this patient's condition?
