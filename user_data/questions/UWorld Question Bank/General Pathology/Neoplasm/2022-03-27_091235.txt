Abnormal growth of neoplastic cells can arise due to mutation of either proto-oncogenes or
anti-oncogenes (tumor suppressors). Proto-oncogenes stimulate cell proliferation, and their
overexpression/amplification (eg, activating mutation) leads to increased cellular proliferation
and neoplastic growth. KRAS is a proto-oncogene often activated in tumor cells, thereby

increasing the cellular response to mitogenic stimuli.

In contrast, anti-oncogenes are tumor suppressors as they inhibit cellular proliferation. Their
inactivation (eg, loss-of-function mutation) contributes to tumor development. APC, BRCA1,
RB, and TP53 are anti-oncogenes and are therefore more likely to be inactivated in neoplastic

cells:

¢ APC is inactivated in familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome. Similar mutations are
found in many sporadic colon cancers (Choice A)

¢ BRCAT is responsible for DNA repair. Its inactivation increases the risk of developing
breast and ovarian cancer (Choice B)

e When active, RB suppresses the transition of cells from the G1 to S phase of the cell
cycle, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. An inactivated RB is found in many tumors
(Choice D)

e Mutated 7P53 is the most common abnormality associated with cancer development.
