e Vimentin: Mesenchymal (eg, fibroblast) origin (Choice C)
(Choice A) Tumors of endothelial origin (eg, angiosarcoma) are typically positive for CD31 (ie,
platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 [PECAM1]), which participates in leukocyte
transmigration, and von Willebrand factor, which binds platelets.

(Choice D) Lymphoid neoplasms (eg, lymphoma) frequently express CD45, a glycoprotein
found on most hematopoietic cells. Lymphomas can be further classified based on expression
of B-cell markers (eg, CD20) or T-cell markers (eg, CD3).

(Choice E) Melanocytic neoplasms (eg, melanoma) typically express S100 (protein in cells of
neural crest origin), SOX10 (transcription factor in cells of neural crest origin), and HMB-45
(marker of premelanosomes).

Educational objective:

The proteins that compose intermediate filaments (IFs) vary based on tissue type.
Cytokeratins are a type of IF protein found in epithelial cells. Positive staining for cytokeratin in
tumor cells suggests that a tumor has epithelial origin (eg, carcinoma).
