kinases, allowing the cell to proceed through the G1/S checkpoint. Loss-of-function
mutations affecting the Rb protein result in unrestricted progression through the G1/S
checkpoint, leading to uncontrolled cell division. Inciting RB7 mutations have been linked to

retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.

(Choice A) Many receptor tyrosine kinases have stimulatory effects on cell growth, and
increased receptor activity occurs with a variety of cancers. For example, overexpression of
EGFR and MET are associated with non-small cell lung cancer, and HER2 is associated with

breast cancer.

(Choice B) Abnormal K-Ras GTPase function due to a KRAS mutation prevents the
conversion of GTP to GDP, which results in constant activation of the MAPK pathway and
uncontrolled cellular proliferation. KRAS mutations are associated with lung and colorectal

cancers, not retinoblastoma.

(Choice C) Tumor suppressor protein p53 arrests the cell cycle at the G1/S checkpoint if DNA
damage is detected and initiates cell apoptosis if DNA repair fails. Mutations of p53 are
associated with most cancers, particularly Li-Fraumeni syndrome (sarcoma, breast, leukemia,
and adrenal cancers). Rb and p53 proteins are both critical components of tumor suppression
pathways, and their normal function complements one another to prevent cancer progression.
