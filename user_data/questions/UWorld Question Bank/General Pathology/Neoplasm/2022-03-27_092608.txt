young age. Patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome inherit one mutated allele of 7P53, but
somatic mutation of the second allele is needed for tumor development (2-hit hypothesis).

p53 plays an essential role in maintaining the integrity of the human genome by causing cells
with mutant DNA to arrest in the G1/S stage of the cell cycle until the damage is repaired.
Normally, cells with irreversible DNA damage are not allowed to divide and proceed to
apoptosis. Without a functioning p53 protein, the defective cells divide unchecked and
become cancerous.

(Choice A) The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutation is found in patients with
familial polyposis syndromes, sporadic colon cancer, and melanomas. APC is responsible for
maintaining low levels of B-catenin (oncogenic protein) and for intercellular adhesion.

(Choice B) Mutation of the BRCA7 tumor suppressor gene increases the risk for breast and
ovarian cancers, and it is the most common hereditary breast cancer. This mutation is not
associated with sarcomas, leukemia, or brain tumors.

(Choice C) NF2is a tumor suppressor gene. Mutation of NF2 increases the risk for

developing neurofibromatosis type 2. Patients present with bilateral acoustic neuromas
(schwannomas of the cerebellopontine angle). Symptoms include bilateral hearing loss,

vertigo, and tinnitus.
