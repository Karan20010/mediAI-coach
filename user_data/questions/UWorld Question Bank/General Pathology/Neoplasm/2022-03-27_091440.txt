Tumor formation is driven by the accumulation of mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell

growth. Two types of genes can be altered to increase malignant potential:

¢ Protooncogenes (eg, RET), which require gain-of-function mutations to convert to
oncogenes. They typically encode proteins that promote cell division (eg, growth
factors, receptors, signal transduction factors). Only one allele must be damaged to
increase the risk of cancer formation.

¢ Tumor suppressor genes (eg, 7P53, RB), in which loss of function results in
unregulated growth. They typically encode proteins involved in apoptosis or inhibition of
cell cycle progression; both alleles must be inactivated to increase the risk of malignancy.

Oncoviruses can induce cancer-forming mutations through the expression of proteins that
activate protooncogenes or inactivate tumor suppressor genes. Human papillomavirus (HPV)
is implicated in several types of cancer, including head and neck, cervical, anal, and penile
cancer. HPV produces viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, both of which affect tumor
suppressors:
¢ HPV viral protein E6 binds to p53, a tumor suppressor protein that normally inhibits the
proliferation of cells with genetic abnormalities. Ubiquitination of the E6-p53 complex

induces degradation of p53, leading to unregulated cellular growth.
