An increase in the activity of enzymes responsible for DNA synthesis (eg, dihydrofolate
reductase, DNA polymerase) signifies that the cell is in the S phase of the cell cycle.
Immediately prior to the S phase is the G1/S checkpoint, in which the cell ensures DNA

23] integrity. Cells with damaged DNA are not allowed to enter the S phase to limit propagation of

mutations.

Retinoblastoma (Rb) protein is a regulator of the G1/S phase transition. The Rb protein has
two forms, active (dephosphorylated) or inactive (phosphorylated). When the cell is stimulated
by growth factors, activation of cyclin D, cyclin E, and the corresponding cyclin kinases (CDK 4
and 2) occurs and the Rb protein is phosphorylated (rendering it inactive). Phosphorylated
Rb releases the E2F transcription factor, which allows progression through the G1/S
checkpoint. After the cell divides, Rb protein is dephosphorylated (active) and remains so
until the cell is ready to enter S phase again.

In terminally differentiated cells, the Rb protein stays in the dephosphorylated (active) state
bound to E2F transcription factors, resulting in inhibited transcription of genes necessary for
G1/S transition. Therefore, active Rb protein stops the cell from dividing and allows the cell to
enter a quiescent (GO) phase.
