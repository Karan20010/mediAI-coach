cycle, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. An inactivated RB is found in many tumors
(Choice D)

¢ Mutated 7P53 is the most common abnormality associated with cancer development.
TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that produces p53, a protein that inhibits proliferation of
cells with genetic abnormalities (Choice E)

Some of the important proto-oncogenes, anti-oncogenes, and their associated tumors are
listed in the table.

Educational objective:

Most tumors possess multiple cytogenetic abnormalities. Activation of proto-oncogenes
results in stimulation of cellular proliferation. Inactivation of anti-oncogenes eliminates
oversight of the cell cycle.
