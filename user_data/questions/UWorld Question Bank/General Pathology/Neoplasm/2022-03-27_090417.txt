Squamous dysplasia is marked by a breakdown in the normal organized progression from tall

cells in the basal layer to flattened cells on the surface. Individual cells are often pleomorphic

(differing in shape and size) and also show significant abnormalities such as abundant mitotic

figures and large hyperchromatic nuclei. The risk of progression to invasive carcinoma is

directly linked to the degree of epithelial architecture disruption, as follows:

¢ Low-grade dysplasia — involves only a small portion of the epithelium (typically less than
one-third); it usually spontaneously regresses and requires no treatment.

¢ High-grade dysplasia — involves most or all of the epithelium but does not penetrate the
basement membrane; it is associated with a high risk of progression to invasive cancer
and is typically referred to as carcinoma in situ.

¢ Invasive carcinoma — involves the full thickness of the epithelium and penetrates the
basement membrane. The malignant cells may be similar to those found in the tissue of
origin (well differentiated), or may lack the characteristic features of cells found in the
tissue of origin (poorly differentiated).

Cervical dysplasia is almost always due to underlying infection with oncogenic serotypes of
