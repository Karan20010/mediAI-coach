EE _Cethargic and ill appearing. Bronchial breath sounds and crackles are present in the right lung.

Blood and sputum cultures grow Klebsiella pneumoniae. \|t is determined that the bacteria
express a lipopolysaccharide on their outer membrane surface that stimulates toll-like
receptors in the inflammatory cells. This in turn leads to degradation of the IkB inhibitor
protein, which normally binds to a latent transcription factor found in the cytoplasm. Which of
the following factors is most likely to be directly activated by the removal of this inhibitor
protein?

A. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (3%)
B. Janus kinase 2 (6%)

Y  C. Nuclear factor-kappa B (67%)
