influence on epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts. EGF does not appear to play as

important a role in angiogenesis as VEGF or FGF-2.

(Choice C) Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), or somatomedin C, is synthesized
predominantly by growth hormone-influenced hepatocytes and serves to stimulate cell growth
and multiplication. IGF-1 does not appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis, but it can
indirectly promote it by encouraging cell growth.

(Choices D and E) Although the proinflammatory nature of interleukin-1 (IL-1) can induce the
release of other proinflammatory cytokines that trigger cellular VEGF expression, IL-1 does not
appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis. Similarly, although interferon-y can indirectly
promote neovascularization through activation of macrophages (can release VEGF), it does
not appear to directly stimulate angiogenesis.

Educational objective:

The key growth factors that promote angiogenesis in neoplastic and granulation tissue are
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor. Proinflammatory
cytokines (eg, interleukin-1, interferon-y) can indirectly promote angiogenesis through
increased VEGF expression. The laminin in basement membranes may pose a physical

barrier to the sprouting of new blood vessels.
