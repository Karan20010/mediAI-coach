Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade components of the
extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane, which are composed primarily of laminin
and collagens IV and VII. These enzymes participate in many physiologic processes, such as
tissue remodeling and embryogenesis. They also facilitate basement membrane
penetration, which distinguishes an invasive tumor from carcinoma in situ and includes the
following steps:

1. Tumor cells detach from surrounding cells in a process commonly determined by
decreased (rather than increased) expression of adhesion molecules, including E-
cadherins (Choice D)

2. Tumor cells adhere to the basement membrane; this is facilitated by increased expression
of laminin and other adhesion molecules

3. Tumor cells invade the basement membrane via enhanced secretion of proteolytic
enzymes (eg, metalloproteinases, cathepsin D protease)

(Choice A) Acid hydrolases, which function at acidic pH, are primarily degradative lysosomal
enzymes.

(Choice B) In humans, alkaline phosphatase is concentrated in liver cells; elevated levels
