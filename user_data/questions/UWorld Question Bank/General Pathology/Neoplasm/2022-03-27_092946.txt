(Choice C) The MEN7 gene codes for a tumor suppressor protein. Mutations are associated
with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (pituitary adenomas, primary hyperparathyroidism,
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) but not type 2.

(Choice D) p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell
cycle control. Inactivating mutations or deletions are present in a large percentage of human
tumors, including anaplastic thyroid cancer, but not typically in early-stage MTC.

(Choice E) BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) is an antiapoptotic gene that enhances cell survival. Its
expression is upregulated in many cancer cells. BCL2 mutations are common in many
follicular lymphomas.

(Choice F) Mutations in JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) are seen in a variety of myeloproliferative
disorders such as primary polycythemia and essential thrombocythemia.

Educational objective:

Medullary thyroid cancer is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from calcitonin-secreting C
(parafollicular) cells. It is often seen in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (A
and B), although the majority of cases are sporadic. Both sporadic and familial medullary
thyroid cancers are associated with mutations in the RET proto-oncogene.
