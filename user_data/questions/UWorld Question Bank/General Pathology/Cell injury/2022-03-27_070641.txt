Patterns of tissue necrosis

Type

Etiology

Morphology

Liquefactive
necrosis

¢ Severe bacterial infections
(eg, gangrene)
¢ CNS infarcts

¢ Necrotic tissue is digested by

hydrolytic enzymes into a viscous

fluid:

© Infected abscess fluid is creamy
yellow due to dead leukocytes
(pus)

© Brain infarcts resolve into CSF-
filled spaces

Fibrinoid

necrosis

¢ Hypertension
¢ Vasculitis

¢ Damaged vessels leak fibrin/immune
complexes

¢ Eosinophilic layer of proteinaceous
material in vessel walls

Fat necrosis

¢ Acute pancreatitis
¢ Trauma (subcutaneous
adipose tissue)

¢ Free fatty acids released by active
enzymes (eg, lipases) or mechanical
damage

e Fatty acids combine with calcium,
forming chalky-white deposits
(saponification)

¢ Mycobacterial infections

e Friable, cheeselike material
composed of cell fragments &

Caseous ¢ Fungal infections (eg, amorphous proteinaceous debris
necrosis Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, |* Surrounded by epithelioid
Coccidioides) macrophages & giant cells
(granuloma)
¢ Tissue architecture is preserved due
to denaturation of lytic enzymes:
Coagulative |e Irreversible ischemic injury © Cells are anucleate with
necrosis outside CNS eosinophilic cytoplasm

© Leukocytes eventually infiltrate &
digest necrotic tissue

CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.
