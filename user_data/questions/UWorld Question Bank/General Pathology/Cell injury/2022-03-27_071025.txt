This patient developed signs of acute radiation enteritis (eg, abdominal pain, diarrhea,
inflammation and denudation of intestinal mucosa) 3 weeks after starting radiotherapy for
prostate cancer. Therapeutic ionizing radiation is commonly used to treat or palliate many

types of cancer (eg, prostate, breast) and causes cell damage through 2 primary mechanisms:

¢ DNA double-strand breakage: Breakage of both strands is required; single-strand breaks
can be repaired by polymerases.

¢ Generation of reactive oxygen species: Unstable molecules formed by the ionization of
water; oxygen free radicals can cause cellular and DNA damage.

Radiation-induced DNA damage impairs mitosis and initiates apoptosis of susceptible cells,
including intestinal crypt stem cells and other highly proliferative cells (eg, cancer cells,
hematogenous precursors). Cellular damage also induces an immune response characterized
by increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-
alpha) and migration of leukocytes (eg, neutrophils) to the affected tissue, processes that
produce additional reactive oxygen species and contribute to the radiation-induced tissue
damage.

In the gastrointestinal tract, these changes result in progressive inflammation, edema, and
