A 74-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to 2 days of left leg pain and
numbness. She has a history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Her left lower limb is pale
and cold to palpation below the knee. Arterial Doppler ultrasound shows an occluding
thrombus, and a left femoral embolectomy is performed. Post-procedure dorsalis pedis and
posterior tibial pulses become palpable. Several hours later, the patient begins to experience
severe left calf pain. On repeat examination, the left calf is swollen, tense, and tender, and the
pain worsens with dorsiflexion of the left foot. The distal pulses are also absent. The
physician suspects injury of the reperfused muscles in part due to overproduction of reactive
oxygen species. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to help neutralize these toxic
molecules?

©) A. Cytochrome oxidase
©) B. Cytochrome P450
(©) C. Myeloperoxidase

(©) D. NADPH oxidase

(© E. Superoxide dismutase
