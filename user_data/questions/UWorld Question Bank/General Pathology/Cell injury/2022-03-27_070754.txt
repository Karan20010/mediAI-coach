(Choice B) Focal tuberculous infection can occur in the CNS and cause granulomas with
caseous necrosis (epithelioid macrophages around a necrotic focus) within the affected
parenchyma. However, the onset of neurologic symptoms in patients with tuberculous brain
abscesses tends to be more chronic and progressive than this patient's acute presentation.

(Choice C) Breakdown of adipose tissue (ie, fat necrosis) due to mechanical trauma or
pancreatic enzyme release (eg, acute pancreatitis) is characterized by infiltrating foamy
macrophages containing engulfed lipid debris and release of free fatty acids that combine with
calcium to form basophilic deposits.

(Choice E) Coagulative necrosis occurs following hypoxic cell death in all tissues except the
CNS. It results in the acute denaturation of structural and enzymatic cellular proteins. Cell
nuclei disappear, but the basic architecture of the affected tissue is preserved because
intracellular proteolytic enzymes are inactivated during the injury process.

Educational objective:

Irreversible ischemic injury to brain tissue causes tissue digestion by hydrolytic enzymes
(liquefactive necrosis). The infarcted CNS tissue is eventually replaced with a cystic astroglial
scar. In other organs, lethal ischemic injury results in coagulative necrosis.
