Apoptosis is a means of carefully regulated cell death in which the cell activates enzymes to
degrade its own nuclear DNA and proteins. Although the cell membrane remains intact during
apoptosis, the cell becomes an appealing target for phagocytosis. Because no cell contents
are leaked into the surrounding tissue, there is no associated inflammation.

The process of apoptosis is separated into an initiation phase and an execution phase. During
the initiation phase, protein-hydrolyzing caspases are activated. In the execution phase, these
caspases bring about the cell death by cleaving cellular proteins and activating DNAses.

The initiation of apoptosis occurs via signals from two separate pathways: the intrinsic
(mitochondrial) pathway and the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. In the intrinsic pathway,
the mitochondria become more permeable and pro-apoptotic substances are released into the
cytoplasm in response to stress or the cessation of survival signals. Once the cell is exposed
to stress or the cessation of survival signals, the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-x that
reside in the mitochondrial membranes and cytoplasm are replaced with pro-apoptotic proteins
such as Bak, Bax, and Bim. The pro-apoptotic proteins allow for the increased permeability of
the mitochondria, which results in the release of caspase-activating substances like
cytochrome c.
