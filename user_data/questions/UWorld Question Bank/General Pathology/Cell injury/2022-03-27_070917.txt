the cellular membrane with subsequent leakage of cellular contents.

(Choice C) Both Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies are caused by X-linked
mutations to the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin provides mechanical stability to muscle cells
during contraction. Mutations are associated with membrane tears that allow calcium to enter
the cell and cause myofiber damage.

(Choice D) Telomeres are DNA-protein structures at the end of chromosomes that shorten
with each cell division. When telomeres shorten beyond a certain point, the cell undergoes
apoptosis or senescence.

(Choice E) Reprogramming of undifferentiated mesenchymal cells (eg, connective tissue) is a
form of metaplasia. Metaplasia is characterized by the substitution of one differentiated cell
type for another differentiated cell type not normally found in that tissue (eg, bone formation in
muscle tissue after muscle injury).

Educational objective:

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway mediates targeted protein degradation, which allows for
rapid disposal of unneeded intracellular proteins. In cancer-related cachexia, high levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines lead to increased ubiquitination of sarcomeric muscle proteins,
