Educational objective:

lonizing radiation causes cellular and DNA damage primarily through generation of reactive
oxygen species, which can trigger progressive inflammation and tissue damage. In the
gastrointestinal tract, the acute effects of radiation exposure typically occur several weeks after
radiotherapy is initiated and manifest as abdominal pain and diarrhea due to mucosal
denudation, inflammation, and edema.
