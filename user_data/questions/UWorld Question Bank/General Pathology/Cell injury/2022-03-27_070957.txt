(Choice B) Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize endogenous toxins as well as drugs.
They are capable of producing reactive oxygen species, which can contribute to the

t

hepatotoxicity seen with certain drugs.

(Choice C) Myeloperoxidase is found in neutrophils and converts hydrogen peroxide to
hypochlorous acid, a bactericidal compound that also causes oxidative damage to host cells.

(Choice D) NADPH oxidase catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen to superoxide free
radicals, aiding in bacterial destruction by phagocytic cells. Deficiency leads to chronic
granulomatous disease in which those affected are unable to destroy catalase-positive
organisms.

Educational objective:

As an antioxidant, superoxide dismutase neutralizes reactive oxygen species, preventing cell
injury. In a pathologic state such as post-ischemic reperfusion, oxidative stress is high and
reactive oxygen species production exceeds the neutralizing capability of antioxidants, leading
to increased cell damage and death.
