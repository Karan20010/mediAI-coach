The vignette describes acute compartment syndrome secondary to reperfusion injury.
Restoration of arterial blood flow to an affected limb floods ischemic tissue with oxygen.

t

Molecular oxygen reacts with xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidase, and nitric oxide synthase to
form reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet
oxygen. ROS disrupt cellular functions leading to DNA mutations, protein synthesis disruption,
and membrane lipid peroxidation.

Antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and
catalase, convert ROS to oxygen and water, neutralizing their capacity for cellular damage.
ROS generated during cellular respiration are typically neutralized by antioxidants before they
become problematic. However, in the postischemic state, the production of ROS exceeds
the neutralizing capabilities of antioxidant enzymes (high oxidative stress), leading to
increased cell injury and death.

(Choice A) Cytochrome oxidase is the final component of the electron transport chain and
functions to convert molecular oxygen to water while establishing the proton gradient
necessary for synthesis of ATP.

(Choice B) Cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize endogenous toxins as well as drugs.

They are capable of producing reactive oxygen species, which can contribute to the
