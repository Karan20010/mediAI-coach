This patient with multiple risk factors for hypercoagulability (ie, malignancy, membranous
nephropathy) has flank pain, hematuria, and a wedge-shaped perfusion defect in the right
kidney. This presentation is consistent with a renal infarction, likely from thromboembolic
disease. Prolonged ischemia (as seen in infarcted tissue) results in irreversible cellular injury
and cellular necrosis.

Necrosis is an uncontrolled process of cell death that results in denaturation of cellular proteins
and enzymatic digestion of cellular components. Unlike apoptosis, necrosis leads to a loss of
membrane integrity and leakage of proinflammatory intracellular material that can injure the
surrounding tissue.

Necrosis occurs in several distinct morphologic patterns. In most organs, irreversible
ischemic injury typically results in coagulative necrosis. Because the digestive enzymes
denature before they can significantly disrupt tissue integrity, the cellular architecture is
maintained but nuclei are absent. A major exception is tissue within the CNS, in which
ischemia (eg, stroke) causes liquefactive necrosis with digestion of cellular constituents and
liquefaction of necrotic tissue (Choice E).

(Choice A) Caseous necrosis is a pattern of necrosis seen with mycobacterial or certain

fungal (eg, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus) infections. Collections of epithelioid macrophages and
