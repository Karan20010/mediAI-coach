Bias refers to a systematic error (due to nonrandom factors) that can result in an incorrect
association between the exposure and outcome. In general, when bias is present, the results
are consistently distorted in one direction. In prospective studies, if loss to follow-up
occurs disproportionately between the exposed and unexposed groups, attrition bias can
result if the lost subjects differ in their risk of developing the outcome compared to the
remaining subjects. Attrition bias is a form of selection bias (a term that most often refers to

systematic differences between groups in terms of treatment response or prognosis). Attrition

bias does not occur when the losses happen randomly between the exposed and unexposed

groups, as this simply leads to a smaller study population.

In this example, a substantial number of subjects (800 / 4000 = 20%) were lost to follow-up,
primarily those with higher levels of alcohol consumption. If these lost subjects had a higher
incidence of breast cancer than those remaining in the study, then a selective loss of high-risk
subjects would have occurred in the exposed group. As a result, the measure of the
association between alcohol use and breast cancer would be underestimated, which might
explain why no significant association was seen in this study (as the confidence interval of
0.90 to 1.85 crosses 1, which is the null value for relative risk).
