In laboratory measurements, although 95% is often used as a reference range, a 99% range is
used in certain cases (eg, to determine cutoff for troponin in acute myocardial infarction).
Other laboratory analysis methods involve performing more specific calculations when it is
important to detect a difference in one direction (eg, for a cancer marker, knowing that the
value is significantly higher than normal is more important than knowing that it is significantly
different—either higher or lower—than normal). In some cases, high-sensitivity assays (eg,
high-sensitivity C-reactive protein testing) allow the detection of values in the lower range of
normal, which would not have been possible with standard assays.

Educational objective:
In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation (SD)
from the mean; 95% are within 2 SD from the mean; and 99.7% are within 3 SD from the

mean.
