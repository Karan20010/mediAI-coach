Question Id: 1272

Statistical power, (1 — 8), represents a study's ability to detect a difference when one exists. It
is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is truly false - ie, the probability of
finding a true relationship. Power depends on sample size and the difference in outcome
between the groups being tested. In this study, the researchers want to detect a difference
between drug B and standard of care if one exists; they want to maximize power.

8 is the probability of committing a type II error (Choices B and D). Type II error occurs when
researchers fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is truly false. This causes investigators to
miss true relationships. An example of a type II error would be a study finding that aspirin
does not affect platelet function when, in fact, it does. Therefore, if B is set at 0.2, the power
will be (1 — B) = 80%; there will be an 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is

truly false.

(Choices A and C) Type | error occurs when researchers reject the null hypothesis when the
null hypothesis is really true. That is, a study finds a statistically significant difference between
2 groups when one does not truly exist. An example would be if a study concluded that candy
improves heart failure mortality when, in fact, it does not. ais the maximum probability of
making a type | error that a researcher is willing to accept. Generally, a is compared to the p-
value, the probability of observing a given result (or more extreme) due to chance alone
