(Choices C and E) A prospective cohort study would have taken individuals without
hypertension from the population, analyzed their blood samples to determine the distribution of
the sodium channel mutation, and followed them over time (years) to determine the proportion
of new cases of hypertension in patients with and without the mutation. In this example,
although hypertension was measured over several days, the objective was not to document
incidence of new cases of hypertension (which would be unlikely to develop over 1 week) but
to measure the prevalence of hypertension while ensuring that average blood pressure
measurements were obtained.

A retrospective design would have also assessed incidence (not prevalence) of hypertension
compared to an earlier period of time, based on a chart review of historic data. Prospective
and retrospective cohort studies are organized by selecting a group of individuals (ie, a cohort)
who do not have the disease of interest (eg, hypertension), determining their exposure status,
and then following them (forward in time or from a point in the past to the present) to assess
for the development of the disease.

(Choice D) Arandomized clinical trial directly compares >2 treatments. Usually, the subjects
are randomly assigned to experience a specific exposure (eg, a medication) or no exposure
(eg, placebo) and are then followed to assess for the outcome of interest (eg, disease).
