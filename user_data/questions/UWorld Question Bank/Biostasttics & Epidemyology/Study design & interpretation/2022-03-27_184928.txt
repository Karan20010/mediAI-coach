Educational objective:

Obesity-related health disparities affect vulnerable populations (eg, lower socioeconomic
status) and arise from patient, health care, and community-related factors. Cross-sectional
analysis can identify specific risk factors (eg, insurance status, health behaviors) correlated to
obesity in different settings, helping to generate hypotheses for further research.
