Observer bias (also known as expectancy bias) occurs when investigators misclassify data
due to preconceived expectations or prior knowledge concerning the study or its
participants. This type of bias is particularly important when outcomes are subjective (ie,
involve personal interpretation of clinical, microscopic, or radiographic findings).

In this case, the pathologists who work at the hospital where the study is being conducted may
know that the study is investigating diabetic nephropathy, or they may have access to
additional medical records that indicate diabetes status. Conversely, the pathologists at other
institutions are more likely to be blinded to the study's objectives and the patients’ medical
history.

(Choice A) Aconfounder is an extraneous variable that is related to the exposure under
investigation but that is also an independent risk factor for a disease. Confounding distorts the
relationship between the exposure and the disease. For example, fatty food intake is a
potential confounder in a study evaluating the association between physical activity and
obesity, as people who do not exercise regularly may be more likely to consume a high-fat
diet.

(Choice B) Lead-time bias refers to the apparent prolongation of survival in patients who
undergo a screening test that allows for earlier diagnosis but does not actually improve
