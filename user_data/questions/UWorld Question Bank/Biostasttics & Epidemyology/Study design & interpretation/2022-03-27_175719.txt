Lab Values

It is important to know how to calculate some basic measures of association when given raw
data. The first step is to organize the data into a 2x2 (contingency) table as shown below.
The standard format includes the exposures in the rows (with "exposure present" listed above
"exposure absent") and the outcomes in the columns (with "outcome present" listed before

The relative risk (RR) represents the risk of an outcome (eg, coronary event) in the exposed
(eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor) divided by the risk of that outcome in the
