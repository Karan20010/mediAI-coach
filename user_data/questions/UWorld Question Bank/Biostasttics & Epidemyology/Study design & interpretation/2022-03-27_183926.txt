Correlation analysis is a statistical technique used to assess the strength and direction of a
linear relationship between 2 quantitative variables (often, but not always, a dependent
and an independent variable). In this study:

¢ The quantitative dependent variable was diastolic pressure (DBP).
¢ The quantitative independent variable was waist circumference (WC).

Correlation analysis can determine whether there is a relationship between DBP and WC. A
statistically significant correlation coefficient indicates that DBP and WC have a linear
relationship (ie, the null hypothesis is rejected) that is either positive (as WC increases, DBP.
increases) or negative (as WC increases, DBP decreases).

(Choice A) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compares the mean of a quantitative
variable of 23 independent groups, as in a study comparing serum ferritin concentrations (ie,
quantitative variable) in children (age 0-12), adolescents (age 13-17), adults (age 18-59), and
seniors (age 260).

(Choice B) The chi-square test evaluates the association between 2 categorical variables, as
in a study evaluating the association between sex (ie, "male" and "female") and myocardial
infarction (ie, presence of myocardial infarction, absence of myocardial infarction).
