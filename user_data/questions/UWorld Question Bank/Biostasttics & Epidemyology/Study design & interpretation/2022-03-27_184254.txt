outcome or measured endpoint. Lead-time bias can occur when a test detects or diagnoses
the disease at an earlier stage than another test without impacting the natural history of the
disease. A study comparing disease survival times may then erroneously conclude that using
the earlier-detection test prolongs survival, when in actuality the increased survival time is due
solely to earlier detection of the disease.

(Choice C) Observer bias occurs when an observer misclassifies data due to individual
differences in interpretation or preconceived expectations regarding a study. It can be reduced
by performing a double-blind study (ie, both observers and participants unaware of
randomized parameters) and by having multiple observers encode and verify the recorded
data.

(Choice D) Diseases with a very low incidence rate in the population will also have a very low
prevalence. According to the rare disease assumption, the odds ratio approximates RR when
disease prevalence is low (eg, <10%).

(Choice E) Selection bias can occur with inappropriate (ie, nonrandom) selection methods or
through selective attrition of the study participants. Although selection bias is a possible
limitation of the study (eg, individuals who take vitamins daily may be more likely to be already

healthy), the fact that the study was limited to healthy, physically active men and that it
