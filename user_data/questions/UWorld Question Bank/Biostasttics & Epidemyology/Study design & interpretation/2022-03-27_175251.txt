Research studies are classified as observational studies (eg, cross-sectional, case control,
cohort) or experimental studies (eg, randomized control trials, factorial, crossover), depending
on how much control a researcher has over the independent variables (eg, risk
factors/exposures, interventions) in a study. The main differences between these 2 types of
study designs are as follows:

¢ In observational designs, the researcher observes the effect of naturally occurring risk
factors/exposures on outcomes of interest.

¢ In experimental designs, the researcher randomly assigns interventions to potential
participants to assess the effect of the controlled interventions.

A randomized control trial is one of the simplest subtypes of experimental designs; it is an
experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to 22 groups to assess the effect
of specific interventions (eg, treatments). In this example, 50 patients who underwent
surgical resection of advanced oral cavity cancer were assigned by chance into either a
tetracycline-ointment treatment group or a standard-of-care control group. The effectiveness of
the topical application of tetracycline ointment for prevention of surgical-site infection was then
assessed by recording the incidence and severity of infections in each group.
