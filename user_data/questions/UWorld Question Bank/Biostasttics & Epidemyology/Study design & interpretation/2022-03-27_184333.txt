formally, the p-value is the probability of observing a given (or more extreme) result due to

chance alone assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

In this example, the RR is 1.4 with a 95% Cl of 1.02-1.85. It can be concluded that daily
alcohol consumption is associated with an increased risk of breast carcinoma (RR >1) and that
the findings are statistically significant (95% Cl does not include the null value of 1.0).
Therefore, the expected p-value would be <0.05.

(Choices B, C, D, and E) These options contain p-values >0.05, so the results would not be
statistically significant. Note the relationship between Cl and p-value: a statistically significant
95% Cl corresponds to a p-value <0.05; a statistically significant 99% Cl (would also not
include the null value and likely be wider than a 95% Cl) corresponds to a p-value <0.01.

Educational objective:
A result is considered statistically significant if the 95% confidence interval does not cross the

null value, which corresponds to a p-value <0.05.
