(Choice D) Pygmalion effect describes the fact that a researcher's beliefs in the efficacy of

treatment can potentially affect the outcome. In the classic classroom experiment that first

described the Pygmalion effect, a group of students were randomly assigned high intelligence

quotient (IQ) scores; their teachers were then told of these artificial results and had higher

expectations of this group as a result. The students with the randomly assigned high |Q

scores actually performed better, likely because their teachers unconsciously behaved in a

manner that would facilitate their success.

(Choice E) Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposures by patients. Although

recall bias is possible whenever questionnaires are administered, it is unlikely in this case as

the patients fill out a form immediately upon leaving the doctor's office.

Educational objective:
The Hawthorne effect (observer effect) is the tendency of study subjects to change their
