A case-control study is the most appropriate study design for evaluating the public health
officials' claim. This is because the disease (acute myelogenous leukemia [AML]) is a rare
condition occurring at a higher rate in this population, and a retrospective exposure (chemical
waste exposure) needs to be evaluated. In case-control studies, 2 groups of subjects are
created: cases (subjects with the disease of interest) and controls (subjects without the
disease of interest). After the case and control groups are selected, exposure frequency to a
specific variable (eg, chemical waste) within both groups is ascertained. If there is a
statistically significant difference in exposure frequency between the 2 groups, it is likely that
the variable in question is associated with disease development.

In this example, AML is the disease of interest; therefore, children with AML should be used as
cases and children without AML should be used as controls. Cases and controls should be
selected regardless of exposure status to the chemical waste (Choices A and B). Selecting
subjects based on exposure status is inappropriate because comparing the frequency of
exposure between the case and control groups is what determines whether the exposure is

more prevalent among cases as compared to controls.

Ideally, exposure frequency among controls should be representative of that among the
population of individuals "at risk" of becoming cases. In other words, for a given case-control
