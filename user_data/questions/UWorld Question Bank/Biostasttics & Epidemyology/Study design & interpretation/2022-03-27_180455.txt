Blinding technique is commonly used in clinical trials. The blinding can involve patients
exclusively or both patients and physicians (double blinding). The main purpose of blinding is
to prevent patient or researcher expectancy from interfering with the determination of an
outcome. For example, a researcher's belief in a positive outcome in treated patients can
potentially result in observer bias.

(Choice A) Beta error refers to a conclusion that there is no difference between the groups
studied when a difference truly exists. Beta error is a random error, not a systematic error (i.e.,
bias).

(Choice B) Recall bias results from the inaccurate recall of past exposure by subjects. It
applies mostly to case-control studies.

(Choice D) Effect modification is not a bias and should not be controlled.

(Choice E) Selection bias results from the manner in which people are selected for the study,
or from the selective losses from follow-up.
