A research group is studying the correlation between BMI and blood pressure in a random
sample of children age 12-16. After collecting data, they conduct a correlation analysis at a
1% significance level. The researchers find that BMI correlates with systolic blood pressure
with a coefficient of r= 0.46 (p <0.001) and diastolic blood pressure with a coefficient of r=
0.37 (jp <0.001). Which of the following is the most accurate interpretation of these results?

©) A. An increase in BMI causes a statistically significant increase in blood pressure in

children

© B. Childhood obesity significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular disease later in
life

() C. There is a statistically significant negative linear relationship between BMI and
blood pressure in children

©) D. There is a statistically significant positive linear relationship between BMI and blood
pressure in children

() E. There is no statistically significant linear relationship between BMI and blood

pressure in children
