In this case, the 95% Cl of [-2.7, -1.3] does not include the null value of 0 and therefore the
result is statistically significant. In summary, cocoa intake was associated with a statistically
significant decrease in SBP.
(Choices A and E) The overall mean change in SBP was negative at -2.2 mm Hg, reflecting

a lower SBP in the cocoa group compared to the control group. The change was statistically
significant.

(Choice B) Although there was a statistically significant decrease in SBP in the cocoa intake
group, the clinical significance may be limited as the absolute SBP decrease is only about 2
mm Hg. Furthermore, the trials measured SBP at 2 weeks, so it is possible that the effect of
cocoa intake on SBP was short-lived. Finally, no information is provided regarding adverse
effects of cocoa intake.

(Choice D) Given that the Cl crossed the null value in studies 2 and 7, there was no
statistically significant difference between the groups in these studies.

Educational objective:
A meta-analysis groups results of several trials to increase statistical power and provide an
overall pooled effect estimate.
