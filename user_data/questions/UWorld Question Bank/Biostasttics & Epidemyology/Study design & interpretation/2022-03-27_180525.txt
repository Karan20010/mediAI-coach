to evaluate the association between 2 categorical variables. In this example, patients are
divided into 2 groups based on serum fibrinogen levels (dependent categorical variable:
normal [200-400 mg/dL], high [>400 mg/dL]) and then divided again based on simvastatin
exposure status (independent categorical variable: treated, not treated), with the data
recorded in a 2 x 2 table. A chi-square test may be conducted to determine whether a
statistically significant association exists between simvastatin use and the high levels of serum
fibrinogen. A large difference in the frequency of simvastatin use between cases and controls
is indicative of an association between simvastatin use and high levels of fibrinogen (ie, the
null hypothesis is rejected).

(Choices A and E) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-sample t-test are used to
compare the means between groups. This would require the dependent variable (ie, outcome)
to be a quantitative variable. The difference between these 2 tests resides in the number of
groups compared. The t-test is used to compare 2 group means, whereas the ANOVA is used
to compare 22 group means. Either of these tests would be appropriate in this example if
fibrinogen levels were recorded as a quantitative variable (ie, the actual measured level in
mg/dL) instead of a categorical variable (ie, normal or high).

(Choice C) The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear
