This scenario describes a typical case-control study design. People with the disease of
interest (ie, cases [women who have just delivered babies with neural tube defects]) and
people without this disease (ie, controls [women who delivered apparently healthy babies])
are asked about previous exposure to the risk factor being studied (eg, acetaminophen use
during the first 3 months of pregnancy). The main measure of association is the odds ratio
(OR). The OR can be calculated as follows:

OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls)

(Choice A) Median survival is calculated in cohort studies or clinical trials, and is usually used
to compare the median survival times in >2 groups of patients (eg, those receiving a new
treatment and those receiving a placebo).

(Choice C) Prevalence ratio is a ratio of 2 probabilities (ie, prevalence) commonly used in
cross-sectional studies to compare the prevalence of disease among exposed and unexposed
groups of people. In case-control studies, cases and controls are selected from a pool of
potential cases and controls that do not represent the real frequency (ie, prevalence) of
disease in the population. Therefore, estimating the prevalence of disease in case-control
studies would be biased.
