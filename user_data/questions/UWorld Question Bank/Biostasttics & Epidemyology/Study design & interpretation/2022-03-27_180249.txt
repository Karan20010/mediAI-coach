Shoe size

A confounder (eg, age) is associated with both exposure (eg, shoe size) and outcome
(eg, 1Q) and affects the measure of association between exposure and outcome, such
that there initially appears to be a statistically significant association between the 2 on
crude analysis (eg, as shoe size 7, IQ 1). However, once the results are stratified by
the confounding variable (age), the association disappears.

For simplicity, this example assumes that older children actually have a higher 1Q (and bigger feet) than younger
‘children do and thatthe same IQ test (not adjusted for age) is administered to all children

10 = inteligence quotient.
