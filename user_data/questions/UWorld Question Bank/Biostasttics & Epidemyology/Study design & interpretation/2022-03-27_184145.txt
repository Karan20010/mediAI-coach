would have appeared by natural history alone, so that the time from diagnosis until death
appears prolonged even though there might actually be no improvement in survival.

(Choice B) Observer bias can occur in clinical trials when study participants or investigators
are aware of individual treatment assignments. It can be prevented by performing a double-
blind study in which neither participants nor investigators are aware of treatment assignments.

(Choice C) Misclassification bias occurs when either the exposure or the outcome is not
identified correctly. Random (or nondifferential) misclassification affects all groups to the same
extent. For example, if a pediatric size sphygmomanometer cuff is used on all participants
(treatment and control groups) as part of a study in adult patients, the blood pressure readings
will be incorrect (due to the incorrect cuff size). However, the resulting misclassification will
likely affect both groups to the same extent (because the same cuff was used).

(Choice D) Recall bias results from the inaccurate recall of past exposure status. Itis a
potential problem for retrospective studies such as case-control studies, particularly when
questionnaires are used to inquire about distant past exposure. However, in this prospective
study, exposure status is determined through periodic questionnaires assessing daily alcohol
consumption (without inquiring about distant past exposure). In such a scenario, recall bias is

less likely to affect results.
