Statistical power represents a study's strength to detect a difference (ie, effect size)
between treatment groups when one truly exists. It depends on sample size (among other
factors): studies with greater sample sizes have greater power than studies with smaller
sample sizes. An excessively large sample size may determine that a clinically irrelevant
difference between groups is statistically significant (ie, p < 0.05), while an inappropriately
small sample may fail to determine that a clinically relevant difference between groups is
statistically significant (ie, p > 0.05).

In this case, the rate of relapse in the group receiving the new cream is 25% and the rate in
the group receiving the emollient alone is 50%. This represents a relative risk reduction
(RRR) of 50% (ie, [50% - 25%] / 50%); therefore, the new cream reduced the risk of relapse
by 50% (ie, effect size) compared to emollient alone. A 50% risk reduction may be considered
clinically relevant; however, it was not statistically significant (ie, p = 0.14 > 0.05) in the
study.

The most likely explanation is that the sample size (ie, 15 per group) provided insufficient
power to detect the observed difference between groups (ie, effect size, RRR = 50%). A
larger sample size would increase the power of the study (ie, its ability to detect the
