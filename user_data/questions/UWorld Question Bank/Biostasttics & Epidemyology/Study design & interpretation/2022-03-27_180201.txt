The new drug, KM28, will be approved if its associated recurrence rate is decreased by at
least 40% compared to the recurrence rate on standard therapy alone, which is given as 8%.
As 40% of 8% is 0.40 x 8% = 3.2%, the maximum acceptable recurrence rate is 8% - 3.2% =
4.8%. Another quick solution would be to state that the maximum acceptable recurrence rate
is 60% of 8%, which is 0.60 x 8% = 4.8%.

An alternate solution involves using relative and absolute risk calculations. The 40% (ie, 0.4)
mentioned in the prompt refers to relative risk reduction (RRR), defined as the percent
reduction in absolute risk (AR) between the treatment group (eg, KM28 + standard therapy)
and the control group (eg, standard therapy). The formula for RRR is:

RRR & (ARs: — ARrestment) / AR con

In this example, AReono, Which represents the risk of recurrence with standard therapy, is given

as 8% or 0.08. The formula can be rearranged to calculate AR sesiment:

AReeainen = AReontir — (RRR * AR consi)

Plugging in the values for RRR and ARomnio gives:
AReesiment = 0.08 — (0.4 x 0.08) = 0.08 — 0.032 = 0.048 (ie, 4.8%)
