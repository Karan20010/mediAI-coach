(Choices D and E) Incidence measures (eg, relative risk or relative rate) cannot be directly
measured in case-control studies because cases, by definition, already have the disease (ie,
the study does not follow a cohort for development of a disease). Relative risk and relative
rate are calculated in prospective and retrospective cohort studies, where risk factor
assessment occurs first and then exposed and unexposed groups are followed over time and
assessed for development of disease.

Educational objective:

A case-control study is used to compare the exposure status of people with the disease (ie,
cases) to the exposure status of people without the disease (ie, controls). The main measure
of association is the odds ratio.
