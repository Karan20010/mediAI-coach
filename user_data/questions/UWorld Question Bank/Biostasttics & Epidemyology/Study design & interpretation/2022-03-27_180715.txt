: Researchers studying the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the risk of
6 myocardial infarction (MI) among postmenopausal women calculate the relative risk (RR) of MI
z to be 1.30 (p = 0.07) among women who are taking HRT compared to those who are not. The
9 researchers conclude that there is no statistically significant increased risk of MI with HRT
s (based on a cutoff of a = 0.05). Subsequently, the results of a meta-analysis determine that
12 there actually is an increased risk of MI, with an overall RR = 1.32 (p = 0.03) among
= postmenopausal women who are taking HRT compared to those who are not. Which of the
45 following was the most likely problem in the first study?
