>0); therefore, there is a positive linear relationship between BMI and blood pressure
(Choice C). Because the p-value for both coefficients (p <0.001) is less than 0.01 (the given
significance level of 1%), the linear relationship is statistically significant (Choice E).

Educational objective:

The correlation coefficient (r) indicates whether there is a negative (r <0) or positive (r >0)
linear relationship between 2 variables. The closer ris to -1 or +1, the stronger the linear
relationship. A statistically significant (ie, p-value < significance level) linear relationship
between 2 variables does not imply that the relationship is causal.
