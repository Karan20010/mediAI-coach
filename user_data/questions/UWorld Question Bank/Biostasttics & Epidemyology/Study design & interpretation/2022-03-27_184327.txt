Relative risk (RR) is used in cohort studies to determine how strongly a risk factor (ie,
exposure) is associated with an outcome. RR is the risk of an outcome (eg, breast cancer) in
the exposed group (eg, individuals who consume alcohol daily) divided by the risk of that
outcome in the unexposed group (eg, individuals who do not consume alcohol daily). If the RR
= 1.0 (null value), then there is no association between the exposure and the disease. An RR
>1.0 indicates that the exposure is associated with increased risk of disease. An RR <1.0
means that the exposure is associated with decreased risk of disease.

The RR by itself does not account for the possibility that chance alone is responsible for the
results. The 95% confidence interval (Cl) and p-value are 2 measures of statistical
significance that can help strengthen the findings of a study using RR. For a result to be
considered statistically significant, its corresponding Cl must NOT contain the null value.
When the 95% Cl does not include the null value, this gives a corresponding p-value <0.05
and the association between exposure and outcome is considered statistically significant. A p-
value <0.05 reflects that there is a very low probability that the result was due to chance alone;
formally, the p-value is the probability of observing a given (or more extreme) result due to

chance alone assuming that the null hypothesis is true.

In this example, the RR is 1.4 with a 95% Cl of 1.02-1.85. It can be concluded that daily
