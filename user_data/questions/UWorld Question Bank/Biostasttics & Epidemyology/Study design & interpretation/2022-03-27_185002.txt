smoking cessation.

(Choice B) Prostate-specific antigen is increased in some patients with prostate cancer.
However, annual prostate-specific antigen testing has not been shown to improve mortality
from prostate cancer.

(Choice C) Aspirin use significantly reduces the risk of death from coronary heart disease in
diabetic patients, at levels similar to smoking cessation. However, when all-cause mortality is
compared, smoking cessation has a greater effect on reducing mortality than daily aspirin
therapy.

(Choices D, E, and G) Dietary modification and exercise reduce the risk of cardiovascular
disease (to a lesser extent than smoking cessation) and help improve glycemic control in
diabetic individuals. Although tight glycemic control has been shown to reduce the risk of
microvascular complications from diabetes, it does not significantly improve cardiovascular or
all-cause mortality.

Educational objective:
Smoking cessation is by far the most effective preventive intervention in almost all patients,
and this is especially true in those with diabetes.
