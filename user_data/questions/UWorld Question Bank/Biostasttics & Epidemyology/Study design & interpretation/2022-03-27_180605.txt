(Choice B) Lead-time bias refers to the apparent prolongation of survival in patients who
undergo a screening test that allows for earlier diagnosis but does not actually improve
prognosis. For example, a patient with pancreatic cancer presents with metastases at age 58
for which he receives treatment, but he dies at age 60. Had the same patient been screened
and diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at age 55, he would have received earlier treatment, but
the disease could have progressed such that he would have still died at age 60 (ie, age at
death would not have been affected by screening).

(Choice D) Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposure by people in a study; it
applies most often to retrospective designs such as case-control studies. People who have
experienced an adverse outcome are more likely to recall previous risk factors than people
who have not experienced an adverse outcome.

(Choice E) Selection bias can occur with inappropriate (ie, nonrandom) selection methods or
through selective attrition of the study participants. For example, many patients drop from a
clinical trial due to the severity of side effects associated with the treatment. This type of
attrition is selective (ie, different attrition rates between groups) and reduces the
generalizability of the study.
