A hospital wants to estimate the prevalence of diabetic nephropathy in the surrounding

population of adults with type 2 diabetes. Kidney biopsy samples are obtained from 500 adult

patients with diabetes who receive care at the hospital. The samples are then interpreted by

10 different pathologists, 5 of whom work at the hospital and 5 of whom work at nearby

institutions. A preliminary analysis shows that the pathologists who work for the hospital are 3

times more likely to interpret the biopsy samples as diabetic nephropathy compared to those
who do not work for the hospital. Which of the following most likely explains this difference in

interpretation?

SY C. Observer bias (78%)

A. Confounding (6%)
B. Lead-time bias (0%)

D. Recall bias (3%)
E. Selection bias (11%)
