—~ Question Id: 1207 W 4 Mark: Previous Next Full Screen 2 Lab a
(eg, angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor) divided by the risk of that outcome in the
unexposed (eg, no ACE inhibitor). For cohort studies, it is calculated using the following
formula:
RR = [a/(a+b)] / [c/(c+d)] = (120/400)/(100/300) = 0.90
Understanding the values calculated (rather than memorizing several formulas) would prevent

errors that could occur if the standard format for the 2x2 table is not followed. By definition,
RR = risk among the exposed/risk among the unexposed. In this example, 400 diabetic
patients were taking ACE inhibitors (exposed) and 120 of those had a coronary event.
Therefore, the risk among the exposed is 120/400. Similarly, 300 diabetic patients were not
taking ACE inhibitors (unexposed) and 100 of those had a coronary event. Therefore, the risk
among the unexposed is 100/300. The RR is the ratio of those 2 values: RR =
(120/400)/(100/300).

(Choice B) The odds ratio (OR) is calculated using the following formula: OR = ad/bc. The
OR is often calculated in case-control studies where RR cannot be obtained because such
studies do not follow patients over time to determine the incidence of a new outcome.
