strata will have different measures of association, as seen in this example of the association
between taking the estrogen receptor and the risk of DVT among smokers compared to
nonsmokers. In contrast, with confounding, stratification usually reveals no significant
difference between the strata. For instance, in an analysis of primary school students (of all
grade levels), age can be a confounder that muddies the association between shoe size and
intelligence. Children with bigger shoe sizes may appear to be more intelligent on initial
analysis. However, this association is likely not due to shoe size but rather to age because
older children tend to have both bigger feet and more intelligence. When older and younger
children are analyzed separately (stratification based on the confounder), the association
between shoe size and intelligence disappears.

(Choice C) The latent period is the time required for an exposure to begin having an effect.
However, there is no information on how latency was handled in this study.

Educational objective:
Effect modification is present when the effect of the main exposure on the outcome is modified
by the presence of another variable. Effect modification is not a bias.
