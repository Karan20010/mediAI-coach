consume foods promoting optimal weight).

Other study designs are more appropriate for testing or refining hypotheses following broader
cross-sectional analysis.

(Choices B and D) Like cross-sectional analysis, cohort studies and qualitative surveys offer
observational data for generating hypotheses. However, each of these approaches focuses on
a single, patient-related hypothesis (eg, leptin, patient knowledge and attitudes) for obesity
differences. Cross-sectional analysis involving this community's demographic factors is a
better first step, as it can analyze multiple potential influences and tailor hypotheses to this
setting.

(Choice C) Quality improvement studies analyze and test clinical processes (eg, providing
obesity screening) affecting health care quality. They are less useful for generating broad
hypotheses for community epidemiological patterns (eg, obesity trends).

(Choice E) Randomized controlled trials are more appropriate for testing (rather than
generating) hypotheses; such trials would be premature at this stage. Moreover, this approach
tests only health care factors whereas cross-sectional analysis can assess how other risk

factors correlate to obesity risk in this community.
