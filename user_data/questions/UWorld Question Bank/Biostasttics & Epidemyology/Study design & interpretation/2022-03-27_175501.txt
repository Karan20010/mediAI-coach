Variables are broadly classified as qualitative (ie, categorical) or quantitative (eg, continuous)
based on their scale of measurement. Qualitative variables (eg, type of treatment, blood
type) represent categories or groups whereas quantitative variables (eg, temperature,
glucose levels) represent numerical values. The scale of measurement of the dependent
(eg, outcome) and independent (eg, exposures, risk factors) variables in a study determines
the correct statistical test.
