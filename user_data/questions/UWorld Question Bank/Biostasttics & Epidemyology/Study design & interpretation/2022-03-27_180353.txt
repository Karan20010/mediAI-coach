The scenario described above is a good example of prospective cohort study. Initially a group
of subjects is selected (i.e., cohort) and their exposure status is determined (smoker/non-
smoker). The cohort is then followed for a certain period of time and observed for
development of the outcome (breast cancer). Sometimes, the exposure status is determined
retrospectively and then patients are tracked from that point of time, typically using medical
records (Choice B).

(Choice C) A case-control study is designed by selecting patients with a particular disease
(cases) and without that disease (controls) and then determining their previous exposure
status.

(Choice D) A cross-sectional study is also known as a prevalence study. It is characterized by
the simultaneous measurement of exposure and outcome. It is a snapshot study design that
frequently uses surveys. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to perform.

(Choice E) A randomized clinical trial directly compares two or more treatments. Usually, the
subjects are randomly assigned to an exposure (e.g., a medication) or placebo and then

followed for the development of the outcome of interest.
