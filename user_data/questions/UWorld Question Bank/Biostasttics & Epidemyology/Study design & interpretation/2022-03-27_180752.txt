Researchers want to explore the association between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) use and pulmonary tuberculosis. Arandom sample of subjects age 20-84 with newly
diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis and an independent random sample of subjects without
pulmonary tuberculosis are enrolled in the study. Subsequently, subjects who never had a
prescription for an SSRI are defined as "never users," and those who have had a prescription
for an SSRI are defined as "users." The study compares the frequency of SSRI use in
subjects with and without a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis and determines that SSRI use
is not associated with pulmonary tuberculosis. Which of the following best describes the
design of this study?

YA. Case-control study (62%)
B. Cross-sectional study (13%)
