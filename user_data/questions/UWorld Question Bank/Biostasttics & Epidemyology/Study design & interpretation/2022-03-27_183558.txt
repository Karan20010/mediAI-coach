Research studies are broadly classified as having an observational design or an experimental
design depending on the control the researchers have over the independent variables.

¢ In observational studies (eg, case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-
sectional studies), the researchers have no control over the independent variables (eg,
exposure to risk factors, treatments).

¢ In experimental studies (eg, crossover design, randomized controlled trials), the
researchers control and randomly assign the independent variables (eg, exposure to risk
factors, treatments).

Case series is a descriptive observational study design in which a (generally small) group of

patients with a similar diagnosis or treatment is described at a point in time or followed over a
certain time period. Contrary to other observational designs (eg, cohort, case-control), a case
series has no comparison group (Choices A and D). For this reason, a case series cannot
establish associations between risk factors (eg, treatments) and outcomes (eg, diseases).

In this example, the CT scan findings of 11 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
are being studied. The study has no control group; therefore, it can only describe COVID-19
manifestations on imaging studies.
