the correct statistical test.
Regression analysis is used to describe the association between 1 or more independent
variables (eg, exposures, risk factors), which may be quantitative or qualitative, and 1
quantitative dependent variable (ie, a quantitative outcome [eg, laboratory values]) while

adjusting for other variables of interest. In this study:

¢ The quantitative dependent variable was serum ferritin concentration.

¢ The independent variables were consumption of red meat and eggs reported in
ounces/week (2 quantitative variables).

¢ The effect of the main independent variables (eg, consumption of red meat and eggs) on
the dependent variable (eg, serum ferritin concentration) is adjusted to account for the
effects of other independent variables, which are called adjustment variables (eg, age,
gender). Controlling for these variables reduces the potential confounding.

Calculation of a regression line (eg, line of best fit) can then determine whether dietary
consumption of red meat and eggs has a statistically significant effect on serum ferritin
concentrations (after adjusting for age and gender).

(Choice A) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compares the mean of a quantitative
