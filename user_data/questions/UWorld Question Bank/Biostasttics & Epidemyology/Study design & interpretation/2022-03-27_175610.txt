Lead-time bias should always be considered when evaluating any screening test. Lead-time
bias is an apparent increase in survival time among patients undergoing screening when
they actually have an unchanged prognosis. Patients screened with more sensitive tests
may appear to live longer only because the disease was detected earlier than had it been
diagnosed clinically. The overall length of time from disease onset to death actually remains
the same with or without the earlier screening. To determine the actual effectiveness of the
screening program, it is necessary to follow up patients for periods that are longer than the
apparent increase in survival time, and then to estimate and compare mortality rates among
patients who have undergone the additional screening and those who have not.

In this case, patients screened by the new test appeared to have increased their survival time
by 3 months when compared to those diagnosed by conventional methods. However, there
was no difference in 6-month mortality rate between the 2 groups, which indicates that
there is no actual benefit to the screening program.

(Choice A) Confounding distorts the relationship between risk factors and the disease of

interest, and can wholly or partially account for the observed effect. Although the results of this
study could be potentially confounded, there is no information on how potential confounders

were treated during the design or analysis stage of the study.
