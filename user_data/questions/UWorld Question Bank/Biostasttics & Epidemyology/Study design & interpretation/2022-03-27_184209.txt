Randomization refers to the process of randomly (ie, by chance) assigning subjects to
experimental groups (eg, treatment vs control group). Randomization prevents selection
bias and potentially produces comparable groups by balancing the frequency of confounding
variables (eg, sex, age, severity of disease) between experimental groups. Making
experimental groups as similar as possible (except for the treatment assigned) cancels the
effect that these characteristics may have on the outcome of interest.

For example, having groups that are dissimilar (ie, unbalanced) with respect to severity of
disease may underestimate or overestimate the effect of a treatment, depending on which
group has a greater proportion of severe cases. The best way to account for the effects of
these variables is to randomly assign subjects to experimental groups. Afterward, the groups
are analyzed to ensure that they are statistically similar in underlying variables, with the results
often reported in a baseline characteristics table (eg, weight, sex, age).

Therefore, randomization increases the likelihood that any difference observed between
groups is due exclusively to the treatment and not to other characteristics.

(Choices A and B) A blind study is a type of clinical trial in which either the participants or the
researchers (ie, single blind) or both the participants and the researchers (ie, double blind) are

unaware of treatment assignments. Although this study used randomization to assign patients
