frequency of exposure to the risk factor is compared between cases and controls to estimate
the association between the risk factor and the outcomes. Conducted as designed, this study
can determine if SSRI use is associated with pulmonary tuberculosis.

(Choice B) In contrast to participants in a case-control study, who are selected based on
outcome status (eg, presence or absence of tuberculosis), participants in a cross-sectional
study are randomly selected from a population of interest (eg, random sample from a region
with high tuberculosis prevalence) and then simultaneously categorized according to risk factor
(eg, SSRI use) and outcome (eg, tuberculosis) status. The goal is to determine prevalence by
providing a snapshot of the population.

(Choices C and E) In acohort study, 2 groups of individuals (ie, cohorts) are initially identified
based on their exposure status to a specific risk factor (eg, SSRI use) rather than based on
their outcome status (eg, pulmonary tuberculosis), as seen in this example. These 2 cohorts
are then followed over time (ie, prospectively) to assess development of the outcome.
Sometimes the exposure status is determined retrospectively, typically using medical records,
and patients are tracked from the point of exposure onward.

(Choice D) Arandomized controlled trial follows individuals who have been randomized to

either a treatment arm or a control arm and compares the effect of the intervention.
