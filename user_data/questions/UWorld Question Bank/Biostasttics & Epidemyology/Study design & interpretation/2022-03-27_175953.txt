Efficacy and safety of new drugs are established during the clinical trials process. New
drugs are approved by a regulatory body (ie, Food and Drug Administration) following review
of phase I-III trials. Phases differ in size, objective, and participant selection.

¢ Phase I: Assesses safety and pharmacokinetics. Phase | is usually conducted with a

small number (eg, 20-80) of healthy participants. It often is performed in a strictly
controlled environment with extensive biochemical and physiologic monitoring.

Phase Il: Assesses preliminary efficacy and optimal dosing. Phase II is conducted with a
small number of participants who have the condition of interest, and patient outcomes are
often compared to historical controls. It sometimes is called a pilot study.

Phase Ill: Compares treatment to standard of care. Phase Ill is conducted as a large,
randomized, controlled trial (in contrast to this study, which is a surveillance study with no
control group) to better assess treatment response and safety. It may include analysis of
treatment effects in selected subsets of the target patient population.

The description of this study of a currently available drug is most consistent with a phase IV
(postmarketing) study, which is conducted after regulatory approval of the drug. Phase IV
assesses long-term safety and effectiveness and characterizes uncommon or delayed

adverse effects. It typically involves surveillance of a large number of treated participants to
