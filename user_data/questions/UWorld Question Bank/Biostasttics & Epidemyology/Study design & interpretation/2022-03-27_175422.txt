¢ The outcome of interest is diabetic nephropathy. Exposed and nonexposed subjects
must be selected with no history of the outcome because the occurrence of the outcome
is what is measured during the study period (Choice B).

Therefore, the exposed group is adults with T2DM who have morbid obesity and no diabetic
nephropathy; the nonexposed group is adults with T2DM who have normal weight (BMI
18.5 to <25 kg/m) and no diabetic nephropathy. Comparing the frequency of the outcome
(eg, diabetic nephropathy) between exposed and nonexposed groups is what determines
whether exposure to the risk factor (eg, morbid obesity) is associated with the risk of
developing the outcome (eg, diabetic nephropathy).

Educational objective:

In a cohort study, subjects should be initially selected from the population of interest (eg,
T2DM) based on their exposure status to a risk factor (eg, presence or absence of morbid
obesity). Subjects are then monitored during the study period for development of the outcome
of interest (eg, diabetic nephropathy).
