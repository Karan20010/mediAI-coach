Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are typically case-control studies that involve
scanning thousands of genetic markers in subjects with and without a disease to identify
associations between genetic variants (eg, loci) and that disease. GWAS often use single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with several million SNPs analyzed on 1 microscope slide.

In this case, GWAS are used to analyze hundreds of thousands of loci in Portuguese
patients with and without rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The results are compared to those from a
larger European cohort; both studies are then combined in a meta-analysis. A few loci have
SNPs with an allele that is significantly more common among patients with RA than those
without RA; these loci are therefore associated with RA.

Whenever multiple tests are performed simultaneously (eg, analyzing thousands of loci), the
possibility of false-positive results increases. Using a much smaller threshold for the p-
value is a method to minimize this. Traditionally, a p-value <5% is considered statistically
significant. However, if 100,000 loci are studied at that 5% (ie, 0.05, 5 x 102) level, then
100,000 x 0.05 = 5,000 false positives would be expected. With a much smaller p-value, this
number decreases substantially. For this reason, a p-value of 5 x 10-: ("genome-wide p-

value"), as seen here, is often chosen in GWAS.
