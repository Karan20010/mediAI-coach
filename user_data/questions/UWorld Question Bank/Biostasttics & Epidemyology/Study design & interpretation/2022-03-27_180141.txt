(Choice E) Nested case-control studies start with cohort studies in which participants are
followed over time; those participants who develop an outcome of interest become cases for a
case-control study.

(Choice F) Qualitative studies use focus groups, interviews (structured and semi-structured),
and other anthropologic techniques to obtain narrative information for explaining quantitative
results.

(Choice G) Randomized controlled trials randomly assign subjects into a treatment group or a

control group. The groups differ only in the intervention (treatment) of interest.

(Choice H) Systematic reviews and meta-analyses combine the results of several published
studies (with an emphasis on high-quality, randomized controlled studies) to estimate the

pooled effect.

Educational objective:
