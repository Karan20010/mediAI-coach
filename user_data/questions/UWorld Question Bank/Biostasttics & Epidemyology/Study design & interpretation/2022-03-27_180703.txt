The power of a study is the ability of a study to detect a difference between groups when such
a difference truly exists. Power is related to type Il error (8), which is the probability of
concluding there is no difference between groups when one truly exists. Mathematically,
power is given by:

Power =1-8

In this example, the power of the study is the probability of detecting a difference in blood
cholesterol level between diabetics and non-diabetics if there is a real difference. The
probability of concluding that there is no difference in blood cholesterol level when in reality
there is one is given as 20%; this corresponds to the definition of B (ie, B = 0.20 in this

example). Therefore:

Power = 1—B = 1—0.20 = 0.80

(Choice A) Type | error (a) describes the probability of seeing a difference when there is no
difference in reality. The value of a is generally compared to the probability that the observed
difference is due to chance alone (a simplified explanation of the p-value). In this example, the
probability that the observed difference between diabetic and nondiabetic patients is due to

chance alone is given as 5% (0.05).
