A researcher is interested in assessing the blood folate level of women who live in a population
with a high incidence of neural tube defects. She takes a large random sample (n) of women
age 18-45 and measures their blood folate levels. The researcher finds that the data are
normally distributed, and she reports the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the sample. To
account for sampling variation, she decides to calculate a 95% confidence interval to estimate

the mean of the entire population. The researcher concludes that 2.4 to 4.6 ng/mL might be a
likely range for the true, unknown population mean. Which of the following calculations was
most likely used to compute this interval estimate of the population mean?

(©) A. Mean + 1.96 x SD

© B. Mean + 1.96 x (SD/Vn)
(©) C. Mean + 2.58 x SD

© D. Mean + 2.58 x (SD/Vn)
©) E. Mean + (SD/n)
