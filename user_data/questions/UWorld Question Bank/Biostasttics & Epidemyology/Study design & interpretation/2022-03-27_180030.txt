The correlation coefficient (r) measures the direction and strength of a linear relationship
(ie, association) between 2 variables (that are usually quantitative).

¢ Direction: When r <0, the linear relationship is negative and one variable increases as
the other decreases; when r >0, the linear relationship is positive and both variables

increase and decrease together.

¢ Strength: When r values are close to —-1 or 1, the linear relationship is strong; when r
values are close to 0, the linear relationship is weak.

A correlation analysis evaluates whether a linear relationship exists between 2 variables.
A p-value less than a given significance level indicates that there is a statistically significant
linear relationship between the variables. However, a statistically significant linear relationship
result does not imply that the relationship is causal (correlation # causation) because when 2
variables are correlated, it does not necessarily mean that one is directly causing the other to
change (Choices A and B).

In this study, researchers studied the correlation between BMI and blood pressure in a random
sample of children. Study results showed that the correlation coefficients for BMI and
systolic/diastolic blood pressure are both positive (r = 0.46 and r= 0.37, respectively, are both
