Confounding occurs when the exposure-disease relationship is muddled by the effect of a
confounding variable, an extraneous factor associated with both exposure and disease. An
example is shown in the exhibit. In a primary school, it may appear on crude analysis that
students with bigger shoe sizes have a higher level of intelligence. However, this association
is actually a result of age, not shoe size: Older students tend to have bigger shoe sizes and
also to be more intelligent. Age is a confounder because it is associated with both shoe size
and intelligence and muddles the association between them. When study subjects are
grouped by age (stratification), the association between shoe size and intelligence is no

longer significant.

Similarly, initial crude analysis suggested that alcohol use was associated with bladder
carcinoma (similar to shoe size being associated with intelligence), with a relative risk (RR) of
1.81 and a p-value <0.05. However, smoking is associated with both bladder carcinoma and
alcohol use. Therefore, smoking is a potential confounder that may explain the association
observed between alcohol use and bladder cancer (similar to age in the school example).
Stratified analysis by smoking status shows that both smokers and non-smokers have an RR
~1 with large p-values (>0.05). The RR of 1.81 found on crude analysis disappears and there
is no true association between alcohol consumption and bladder cancer.
