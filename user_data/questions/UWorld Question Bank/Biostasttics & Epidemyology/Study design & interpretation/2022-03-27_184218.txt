unaware of treatment assignments. Although this study used randomization to assign patients
to treatment groups, no information is provided regarding the awareness of participants or
researchers to treatment assignments. By itself, randomization does not make a study blind.

(Choice C) A study that analyzes all participants as initially allocated after randomization,
regardless of what happens during the study period, is using an intention-to-treat (ITT)
analysis. ITT is not a result of randomization; instead, it is used to preserve the effect of

randomization.

(Choice D) Depending on the randomization method (eg, simple, complete) used to allocate
participants into experimental groups, a study may or may not result in groups that are similar
in sample size. Regardless, the goal of randomization is not to create groups of similar size
(which can be done trivially by alternating group assignment as patients enroll) but rather to
make the underlying characteristics of experimental groups as similar as possible.

Educational objective:

Randomization refers to the process of using random methods to assign subjects to
experimental groups. Its purpose is to make experimental groups as similar as possible
(except for the treatment assignment) to ensure that any difference observed between the
groups is due exclusively to the treatment and not to other underlying factors.
