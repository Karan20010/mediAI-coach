Researchers are interested in the association between colorectal carcinoma and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug use. They first interview a group of patients with biopsy-proven
colorectal carcinoma and then interview a group consisting of the patientsâ€™ neighbors who are
of similar age and race. The analysis is based on comparing the results of pairs of individuals

(one from each of the 2 groups) who have similar characteristics. This design technique best
helps address which of the following potential problems with this study?

A. Ascertainment bias (3%)
YB. Confounding (45%)

C. Observer bias (2%)

D. Recall bias (5%)

E. Selection bias (43%)
