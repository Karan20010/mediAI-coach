(Choice C) Meta-analysis involves the pooling of data from several studies to perform an
analysis with greater statistical power than the individual studies alone. For example,
individual studies assessing the effects of aspirin on certain cardiovascular events may be
inconclusive. However, analysis of data compiled from multiple clinical trials may reveal a
significant benefit.

(Choice D) Multiple logistic regression is a method used to predict the probability of a binary
outcome (eg, presence or absence of gastric cancer) based on 1 or more independent
variables that can be either continuous or categorical. For example, this test could be used to
predict the probability of gastric cancer based on alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and
charred food consumption.

(Choice E) The Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a
linear relationship between 2 quantitative (ie, continuous) variables. For example, a study may
report a correlation coefficient describing the association between hemoglobin A1c levels and
average blood glucose levels.

(Choice F) Atwo-sample t-test can be used when 2 group means are compared. This test
could have been used for the example in the question if the study participants were divided
into smoking and nonsmoking groups only (ie, 2 groups instead of 4).
