A case-control study is an observational design in which potential participants are initially
identified as cases or controls according to the dependent variable or outcome (eg,
disease of interest). Once cases and controls are identified, the presence of past exposure to
21 risk factors of interest is determined in each group. Finally, the frequency of exposure to
the risk factors is compared between cases and controls to estimate the association between
the risk factors and the outcomes. If there is a statistically significant difference in the
frequency of exposure to the risk factor between the 2 groups, it is likely that the risk factor in

question is associated with the disease.
In this example:

¢ The population of interest is young athletes. Therefore, both the cases and control groups
must consist of young athletes (Choices F and G).

¢ The disease of interest (ie, what defines a case) is adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS).

Therefore, the cases must have AIS and controls must not have AIS (Choices A, B, and
C).

¢ The risk factor of interest is sacroiliac joint (SlJ) dysfunction. Cases and controls must be
selected irrespective of SIJ status because the presence of SlIJ is what is compared

between cases and controls (Choice E).
