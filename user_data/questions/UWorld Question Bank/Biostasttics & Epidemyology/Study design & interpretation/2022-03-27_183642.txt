(Choices A, C, and D) In accordance with ITT analysis, the investigator in this case should
keep the 12 nonadherent patients in their respective groups for analysis.

(Choice B) An analysis that includes only those patients who strictly adhered to a research
protocol (ie, excluding all nonadherent patients from analysis) follows a per-protocol (PP)
principle. In PP analysis, the benefit of randomization can be lost with significant subject
attrition (eg, sicker subjects selectively dropping out, introducing bias). PP analysis can also
overestimate the effect of the intervention in a practical clinical setting, particularly when the
treatment is somehow aversive to patients.

Educational objective:

Intention-to-treat analysis includes each subject in their initial randomization group even if
subjects stop the intervention or shift to a different intervention. This approach tends to
provide a conservative but more valid estimate of the intervention effect in real-world scenarios
(ie, clinical settings).
