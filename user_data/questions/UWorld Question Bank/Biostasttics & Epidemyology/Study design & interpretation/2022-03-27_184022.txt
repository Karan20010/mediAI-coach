In a reference sample of hundreds of healthy subjects, the laboratory reference range for a
novel marker of cardiac injury is 0.04-0.08 U/mL at the standard 95% level of probability. The
marker has very high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial tissue. The clinical cardiology
team would like to use a 99.7% reference range to assess patients who come to the
emergency department with chest pain and have a high pretest probability of cardiac

reference sample. Assuming a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean of 0.06 U/mL,
which of the following most closely approximates the corresponding reference range?
