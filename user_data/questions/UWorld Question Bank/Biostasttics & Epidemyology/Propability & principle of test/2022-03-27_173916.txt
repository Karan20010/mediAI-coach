Question Id: 19314
(Choices A, B, and C) The 68-95-99.7 rule states that 99.7% of observations lie within 3 SDs;
therefore, 0.997 is the probability that a random competitive gymnast will have an onset of
menarche between age 9.5 and 17.3 years. Similarly, 0.95 is the probability that a random
competitive gymnast will have an onset of menarche between age 10.8 and 16.0 years (ie,
within + 2 SDs from the mean), and 0.68 is the probability that a random competitive gymnast
will have an onset of menarche between age 12.1 and 14.7 years (ie, within + 1 SD from the
mean).

(Choices D and F) Based on the 68-95-99.7 rule, 32% (ie, 100% - 68%) of observations lie
outside 1 SD from the mean, with half (ie, 32/2 = 16%) above and half (16%) below 1 SD from
the mean. Therefore, 0.160 is the probability that a random competitive gymnast will have an
onset of menarche at either age <12.1 years (ie, 21 SD below the mean) or at age 214.7 years
(ie, 21 SD above the mean). Similarly, 0.0015 is the probability that a random competitive
gymnast will have an onset of menarche at either age <9.5 years (ie, 23 SDs below the mean)
or at age 217.3 years (ie, 23 SDs above the mean).

Educational objective:
In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation (SD) of
the mean; 95% are within 2 SDs of the mean; and 99.7% are within 3 SDs of the mean.
