Sensitivity = Specificity =

TN/(TN + FP)

FN = false negative; FP = false positive; NPV = negative predictive value; PPV =

positive predictive value; TN = true negative; TP = true positive.

PPV = TP/ (TP + FP), where TP is true positives and FP is false positives.

NPV = TN/(TN + FN), where TN is true negatives and FN is false negatives.

In this case, PPV = 130 / (130 + 60) = 130/190.

(Choices A and E) Sensitivity is a test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the
disease. Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 130 / (130 + 50) = 130/180. Specificity is a test's
