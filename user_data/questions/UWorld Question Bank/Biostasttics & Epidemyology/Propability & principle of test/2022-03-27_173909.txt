A normal (Gaussian) distribution is a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution with a fixed
percentage of observations lying within a certain distance of the mean. This distance is called
the standard deviation (SD) and represents the degree of dispersion from the mean. The 68-
95-99.7 rule for normal distributions states that 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the
mean, 95% of all observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% of all observations lie
within 3 SDs of the mean.

For competitive gymnasts in this sample, the mean age at menarche is 13.4 years, with a SD
of 1.3 years. Based on the 68-95-99.7 rule:

¢ 68% of observations lie within 1 SD: 13.4 + 1.3 = 12.1-14.7.
¢ 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs: 13.4 + 2.6 = 10.8-16.0.
¢ 99.7% of observations lie within 3 SDs: 13.4 + 3.9 = 9.5-17.3.

An onset of menarche at age 216 years is 2 SDs from the mean; therefore, 2.5% of the
observations must lie above 16 years (with 2.5% of observations below 10.8 years). The
probability that a random competitive gymnast will have an onset of menarche at age 216
years is 0.025.

(Choices A, B, and C) The 68-95-99.7 rule states that 99.7% of observations lie within 3 SDs;
