Lab Values

A novel serum biomarker, UWRLD939, is being evaluated for early detection of pancreatic

cancer. The concentration of UWRLD99 (measured in international units [IU] per dL) has been

found to be elevated in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Test results in 200

volunteers ("healthy") and 190 patients with biopsy-proven pancreatic cancer ("diseased") are

given in the figure below. The investigators determined the sensitivity and specificity of

UWRLD899 for pancreatic cancer using a cutoff of 200 IU/dL (indicated by the solid vertical

line).
