Results of a recent study on the association between levels of glycosylated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (ns-CRP) in patients with type II
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) read as follows:

"The results of our study show that levels of HbA1c positively correlated with the levels
of hs-CRP (r= 0.80). The probability that these results were due to chance alone is
3%, with a 10% chance of concluding no relationship between HbA1c and hs-CRP.
when one truly exists."

Based on this information, which of the following most likely represents the p-value and the
power of the correlation test in the study?
