False negatives describe people who actually have a disease but test negative.

Disease positive | Disease negative
Test positive a > atb
Po True positive False positive
Test negative iv a ctd
False negative True negative
atc btd

Sensitivity = a/(a + c)
Specificity = d/(b + d)

The number of false negatives can be calculated using the test's sensitivity
and total number of patients with acute myocardial infarction. The sensitivity
of a test refers to the number of true positives divided by the total number of
patients with the disease (a / [a + c]). In this case, the sensitivity is 75% and
the total number of patients with AMI (a + c) equals 200. Using this
information, the number of true positives (a) can be calculated as follows:

Sensitivity = a/(a + c)
0.75 = a/200
a=150

Because the total number of patients with the disease (a + c) equals 200
and the number of true positives (a) equals 150, the number of false
negatives (c) is 50.
