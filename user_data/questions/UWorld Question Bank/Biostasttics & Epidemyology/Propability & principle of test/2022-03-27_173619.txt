the probability of at least 1 sample testing positive is 1 - 0.95:. Conversely, the probability that
all 8 samples will return positive is 0.05: while the probability of at least 1 sample testing
negative is 1 - 0.05:.

Educational objective:

If events are independent, the probability that all events will turn out the same is the product of
the separate probabilities for each event. The probability of at least 1 event turning out
differently is given as 1 - P(all events being the same).
