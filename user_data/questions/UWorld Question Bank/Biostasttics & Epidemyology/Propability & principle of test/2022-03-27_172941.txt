Educational objective:

The cutoff value of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is
interpreted as positive or negative. Lowering the cutoff point typically causes more patients
with the disease to test positive, decreasing the number of false negatives and increasing test
sensitivity. Consequently, more patients without the disease will also test positive, resulting in

an increased number of false positives and decreased specificity.
