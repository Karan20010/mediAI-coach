MI = myocardial infarction.

Unlike specificity and sensitivity, PPV varies with disease prevalence. If disease prevalence
increases, PPV increases; similarly, PPV decreases with decreasing prevalence. In this
question, the patient's pre-test probability (which takes into account clinical judgment regarding
how likely it is that he has an Ml) is assumed to be equivalent to the prevalence of MI in the
study, making the results directly translatable. Therefore, PPV = 200 / (200+50) = 200/250 =
0.8 or 80%. In other instances, clinicians may assume that pre-test prevalence equals disease
prevalence in the population.

Educational objective:

Positive predictive value represents the probability of truly having a disease given a positive
test result. It increases with increasing disease prevalence and decreases with decreasing
disease prevalence.
