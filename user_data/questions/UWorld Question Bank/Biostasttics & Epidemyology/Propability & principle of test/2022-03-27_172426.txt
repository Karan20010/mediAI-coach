= case, the specificity is 90% (ie, 0.9) and the total number of patients without UTIs (b + d)

5 equals 300 — 100 = 200. Using this information, the number of true negatives (d) can be

: calculated:

8 Specificity = d/(b + d)

© 0.9 = d/200

d= 180

The total number of patients without the disease (b + d) equals 200, and the number of true
as negatives (d) equals 180. Using this information, the number of false positives (b) can be

7 calculated:

False positives = (b + d) - d = 200 — 180 = 20

21 For the sake of thoroughness, the 2 x 2 table can be completed as follows. Sensitivity refers
to the number of true positives (a) divided by all people with the disease (a + c). Repeating
the same exercise as above gives the completed table:

Sensitivity = a/(a + c)

0.7 = a/100
a=70 Activate Windows
