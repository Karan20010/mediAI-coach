increased confidence level (1 - a); therefore, any statistically significant findings can be
reported with a greater level of confidence.

(Choices D and E) A type Il error occurs when a false H, is not rejected (ie, a false negative:
not finding a statistically significant difference when one truly exist). The probability of a type II
error (known as beta [f]) is the complement of power (1 — 8). Statistical power is the
probability of rejecting a false H,. That is, the power to find a statistically significant difference
when one truly exists (ie, true positive). Reducing the significance level from 0.05 to 0.01
makes the threshold to attain statistical significance more stringent. Consequently, the study
will have less statistical power to detect a statistically significant difference when one truly
exists and will have a higher probability of a type II error (the complement of power).

Educational objective:

Reducing the significance level alpha (a) in a study allows researchers to report any significant
findings with greater confidence.
