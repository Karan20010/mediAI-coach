Sensitivity = a/(a + c); Specificity = d/(b + d)

False positives describe people who test positive for a disease but do not actually have it.
The number of false positives can be calculated using the test's specificity and total number of
patients without urinary tract infections (UTIs). The specificity of a test refers to the number
of true negatives (d) divided by the total number of patients without the disease (b + d). In this
case, the specificity is 90% (ie, 0.9) and the total number of patients without UTIs (b + d)
