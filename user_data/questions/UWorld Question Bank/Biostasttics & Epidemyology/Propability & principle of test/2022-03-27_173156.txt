Researchers want to study the effects of labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation on

hearing, vertigo, and tinnitus. A random sample of medical charts is selected from a cohort of

patients who had undergone labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation in the same ear for

intractable vertigo and hearing loss and who had documentation of both preoperative and

postoperative audiometric evaluations. Tinnitus is quantified using the Tinnitus Handicap

Inventory (THI) before and after the interventions. The THI score ranges from 0 to 100, with

higher values indicating greater tinnitus severity. Which of the following statistical tests is most

appropriate for comparing preoperative and postoperative THI scores?

JY E. Paired t-test (69%)
