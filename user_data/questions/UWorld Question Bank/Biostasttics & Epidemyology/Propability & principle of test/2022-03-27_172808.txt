indicate that the test result is associated with the presence of the disease; likelihood ratios <1

mean that the test result is associated with the absence of the disease. Because positive and

negative likelihood ratios are based on sensitivity and specificity, they are not affected by

disease prevalence.

(Choices D and E) Sensitivity and specificity are not affected by disease prevalence. This is
because sensitivity is calculated using true positives and false negatives (only people with the
disease), and specificity is calculated using true negatives and false positives (only people
without the disease). In this case, the same test (with the same sensitivity and specificity
characteristics) has been used on 2 different populations with a differing prevalence.

Educational objective:

Various parameters are used to evaluate the accuracy and usefulness of diagnostic tests.
Positive and negative predictive values are influenced by disease prevalence in the target
population; sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios are not prevalence-dependent.
