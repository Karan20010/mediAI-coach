Negative predictive value (NPV) is defined as the probability of not having a disease when
the test result is negative. NPV is calculated as the proportion of true negatives divided by
the total number of negative tests (true and false negatives); therefore, it varies with the
prevalence of disease in the target population.

The prevalence of a disease in a population may be used as an estimate for the pretest
probability of having the disease in patients who closely resemble the population. A patient
with a high pretest probability will have a low NPV with a negative test, whereas a patient with
a low pretest probability will have a high NPV with a negative test.

This patient has a high pretest probability for having thyroid cancer since she most likely
received significant radiation exposure to the thyroid during childhood. As such, her negative
cytology results would have a lower NPV when compared to another patient with no risk
factors for thyroid malignancy who also tests negative.

(Choice B) Positive predictive value also varies according to the pretest probability but

applies to positive test results.

(Choices C and D) Sensitivity and specificity of a test are intrinsic characteristics of a test;
