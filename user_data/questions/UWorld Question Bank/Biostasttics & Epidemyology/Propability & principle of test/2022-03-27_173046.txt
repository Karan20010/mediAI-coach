Statistical tests contrast a null hypothesis (H,) and an alternative hypothesis (H.), in this case:

¢ H, is aclaim of no difference between populations (eg, no difference in mean body weight
between the low-carbohydrate population and the low-fat population).
¢ H, is a claim of a difference between populations (eg, difference in mean body weight
between the 2 populations).
Statistical inference uses data from samples (eg, 75 adults in the low-carbohydrate sample,
75 adults in the low-fat sample) to draw conclusions about underlying populations. Sample
estimates or differences (eg, sample mean, difference in mean between 2 samples) generally
vary with distinct samples (eg, if a different sample of 75 adults was chosen for each group)
and may be close but not equal to the underlying population value.

One way to account for sampling variation is to calculate the p-value, which is the
probability of obtaining a sample value at least as large as the one observed when the
population value claimed in H, is assumed to be true. The magnitude of the p-value
compared to a predetermined significance level (eg, 0.05 [or 5%] commonly used as the
threshold) determines whether there is convincing evidence against H,.

¢ Alow p-value (eg, <0.05) occurs when the sample value significantly disagrees with the
