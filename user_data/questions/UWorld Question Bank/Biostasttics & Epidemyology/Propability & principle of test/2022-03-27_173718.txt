(Choices C and D) Sensitivity is defined as a test's ability to identify the true presence of
disease, whereas specificity is defined as a test's ability to identify the true absence of
disease. Poor reliability can limit the sensitivity or specificity of a test if the results from healthy
and diseased populations are close in value.

Educational objective:

A precise/reliable test is reproducible in that it gives similar results on repeat measurements.
Reliability is maximal when random error is minimal.
