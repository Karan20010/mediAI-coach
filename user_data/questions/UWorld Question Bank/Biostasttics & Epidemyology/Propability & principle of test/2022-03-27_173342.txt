The cutoff value of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is
interpreted as positive or negative. When there is overlap between the serum values of the
healthy and diseased populations, a cutoff value that correctly categorizes all individuals in
both populations cannot be chosen. This limits the sensitivity and specificity of the test due
to the presence of false positive (FP) and/or false negative (FN) individuals.

Sensitivity represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those with a given disease. It is
calculated as the number of patients correctly testing positive (TP) divided by the total number
of patients with the disease (TP / [TP + FN]). Specificity represents the ability of a test to
correctly identify those without a given disease. It is calculated as the number of patients
correctly testing negative (TN) divided by the total number of patients without the disease (TN /
[TN + FP}).

In this case, values of the serum marker in women with BRCA mutations show decreased
overlap between the healthy and diseased curves of women with BRCA mutations (curves on
the top) compared with women without BRCA mutations (curves on the bottom). The
corresponding decrease in the number of FPs and FNs means the new serum marker has
higher sensitivity and specificity (ie, better performance) in women with BRCA mutations.
