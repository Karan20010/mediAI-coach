Question Id: 1278
A measurement tool should be precise and accurate to be useful in the clinical setting.
Precision and accuracy are defined as follows:

¢ Precision (reliability) is the ability of a test to reproduce identical or similar results with
repeated measurements (bottom half of figure).

¢ Accuracy (validity) is the ability of a test to measure what it is supposed to measure. For
a new test to be accurate, its results should be equivalent to the results obtained with a
"gold standard" (eg, best conventional test available) on the same individual (right half of
figure).
A precise test gives similar or very close results on repeat measurements. In this example,
repeat measurements of the same sample yielded different results; therefore, the new test has

low precision.

(Choices A and E) To evaluate the accuracy of a new test, its results should be compared to
those obtained with the gold standard test on the same individual. A test can be highly precise
(ie, gives very similar results on repeat measurements) but inaccurate (ie, the measurements
are all incorrect compared to the gold standard). A test that is highly imprecise is also highly
inaccurate. In this case, as there were no test results obtained using the "gold standard", the

accuracy/validity of the test cannot be determined.
