(Choices B and E) Specificity represents the ability of a test to correctly identify those without
the disease. A very specific test has a low rate of false positives, so most healthy patients will
have a negative test result (true negative). Given a test with high specificity, a positive result
would help to rule in a diagnosis (SpPin). Confirmatory tests with high specificity are often
used on patients who test positive on a screening test to ensure that a patient actually has the

disease.

(Choice C) Positive predictive value refers to the probability that a disease is present given a
positive test result. Positive predictive value depends on disease prevalence. When
screening patients for a rare disorder, positive predictive value will often be low due to a high

number of false positives.

Educational objective:

The sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify those with the disease. A highly
sensitive test should always be considered over a highly specific test when screening for life-
threatening diseases, where identification of every person with the disease is important.
