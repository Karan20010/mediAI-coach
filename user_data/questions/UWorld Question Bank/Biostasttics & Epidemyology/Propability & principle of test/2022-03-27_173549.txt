Question

Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase | deficiency is a rare disorder (incidence 1 in 800,000
newborns) with serious and possible irreversible consequences if not detected and treated
early. Therefore, it is important to identify all individuals who potentially have the disease
using a screening test that can be performed on a large number of newborns.

Although an ideal screening test would be highly sensitive and specific, developing a test that
has both of these properties is often not possible, and so a compromise must be made. The
sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify those with the disease: it is the
probability of the test returning a positive result in a person with the disease. A highly
sensitive test will ensure that most patients with the disease will have a positive test result
(leading to few false negative results); therefore, fewer cases of disease are missed. Given
a test with high sensitivity, a negative result would help to rule out a diagnosis (SnNout). This
is important during screening for life-threatening diseases, even if obtaining a high sensitivity
causes an increased numbers of false positives (ie, reduced specificity).

(Choice A) Setting a high cutoff value typically (but not always) produces higher specificity

and lower sensitivity.
