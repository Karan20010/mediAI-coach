¢ Alow p-value (eg, <0.05) occurs when the sample value significantly disagrees with the
population value claimed in H, and provides convincing evidence against H, (ie, H, is
probably wrong). Results are considered statistically significant.
¢ Ahigh p-value (eg, 20.05) occurs when the sample value is close to the population value
claimed in H, and provides convincing evidence in favor of H, (ie, H. might be correct).
Results are considered not statistically significant.
In this case, the given p-value = 0.01; therefore, there is a 1% chance (ie, 0.01) of observing
a mean difference in body weight change (ie, sample estimate) of at least -3.5 kg between
the low-fat and the low-carbohydrate samples when no difference between the populations

is assumed (ie, H, is assumed to be true) (Choice B).

(Choices A, D, and E) The p-value of 0.01 is less than 0.05; therefore, the observed mean
difference is statistically significant at the 5% level. The p-value is not associated with
individual observations in a sample. It accounts for sampling variation (ie, random variation)
not bias (ie, systematic variation).

Educational objective:

The p-value is the probability of obtaining a result (ie, sample estimate) at least as large as the
