Power and p-value are related to the process of hypothesis testing. Research studies
generally compare a null hypothesis (H,) (typically of no difference or no association [eg, no
correlation between glycosylated hemoglobin and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels])
against an alternative hypothesis (H.) (typically of a difference or an association). Hypothesis
testing may result in 1 of 4 possible outcomes:
¢ 2 correct decisions:
© Fail to reject a true H, (ie, determine there is no correlation when one truly doesn't
exists)
© Reject a false H, (ie, determine there is a correlation when one truly exists)
¢ 2 incorrect decisions:
© Type | error: reject a true H, (ie, determine there is a correlation when one truly doesn't
exist)
© Type Il error: fail to reject a false H, (ie, determine there is no correlation when one
truly exists)

The power of a test is the probability of making the correct decision of rejecting a false H,. It

is the conigternsin of the probability of a ate Il error r (B), which is the probability of failing to
