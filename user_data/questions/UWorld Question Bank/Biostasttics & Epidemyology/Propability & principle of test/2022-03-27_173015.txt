¢ OR # 1.0 indicates that the odds of exposure are lower (ie, OR <1) or higher (ie, OR >1)
among cases than among controls; therefore, exposure is associated with the disease.

Because H, is a statement of no association, the most appropriate H, for the study is that the
OR = 1 (Choice D).

(Choices A, B, E, and F) Measures of association based on risk/incidence (eg, relative risk,
hazard ratio) are calculated in cohort studies and experimental designs, in which participants
are initially selected based on exposure status (ie, exposed or nonexposed to a risk factor or
treatment) and then are followed over time to assess development of disease. However, in
case-control studies, cases (by definition) already have the disease. Therefore, case-control
studies cannot calculate and compare the risk/incidence of disease between the case and
control groups. Instead, case-control studies must compare the odds of exposure (to a risk
modifier) between cases and controls.

Educational objective:

The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association used in case-control studies. It quantifies the
relationship between an exposure and a disease; its null value (ie, null hypothesis value) is
always 1 (ie, OR = 1).
