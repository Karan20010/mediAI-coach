(Choices A and E) The probability that all 3 patients have depression can be calculated by
multiplying the probability of each event, (0.091) x (0.104) x (0.135) = 0.001. The
complementary event (ie, the probability that at least 1 patient does not have depression) can
be calculated by subtracting the probability that all 3 patients have depression from 1, or 1 -
[(0.091) x (0.104) x (0.135)] = 0.999.

(Choice B) The probability that only the women have depression can be calculated by
multiplying together the probability of each woman having the disorder along with the
probability of the man not having the disorder, (0.091) x (0.135) x (1 - 0.104) = 0.011.

(Choice C) The probability that at least 1 patient has depression is complementary to the
probability of none of the 3 patients having depression. It can be calculated by subtracting the
probability that none of the 3 patients has depression from 1, or 1 — [(1 — 0.091) x (1 - 0.104)

Educational objective:

The multiplication law of probability states that the probability of 2 or more independent events
occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event.
The multiplication law of probability can be extended to complementary events (1 — probability

of event) in the same manner.
