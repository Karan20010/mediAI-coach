Alpha (a) is the significance level used to establish the statistical significance of study
results. It is usually predetermined by investigators as the threshold to reject a null hypothesis
(H,). The results of a study are considered statistically significant when the p-value (ie,
probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results when H, is true) is less than
the significance level (ie, p-value < a). Alpha is also the probability of making a type | error,
which is rejecting a true H, (ie, a false positive: finding a statistically significant difference when
one does not truly exist). The complement of alpha/significance level is the confidence level
(1 - a), which represents the probability of not rejecting a true H, (ie, a true negative, or not

finding a statistically significant difference when one does not truly exist).

The lower the significance level, the lower the probability of a type | error. However, this
means that the threshold to attain statistical significance is more stringent. Therefore,
reducing the significance level (eg, from a = 5% to a = 1%) decreases the probability of a
type | error along with the probability of finding statistical significance (eg, p-value < 0.05
to p-value < 0.01) (Choices B and C). Adecreased significance level also means an
increased confidence level (1 - a); therefore, any statistically significant findings can be

reported with a greater level of confidence.
