disease in the population, the more likely it is that a patient with a positive test result actually
has the disease.

If the disease is relatively common (eg, gastric cancer in China), there is a higher probability
that a patient who tests positive actually has the disease (ie, more likely to be a true positive).
However, if the disease is relatively uncommon (eg, gastric cancer in the United States), a
patient who tests positive will have a lower probability of actually having the disease (ie, more
likely to be a false positive).

(Choice A) Like PPV, the negative predictive value (NPV) depends on disease prevalence.
However, NPV is inversely associated with the prevalence: NPV increases as the disease
prevalence decreases. This is because the probability of a true negative result is higher in a
population with low disease prevalence (eg, gastric cancer in the United States).

(Choices C and D) Sensitivity and specificity are intrinsic test parameters that do not depend

on the prevalence of disease in the tested population.

(Choice E) Reliability is a measure of the consistency (reproducibility) of a diagnostic test
result (ie, if the test is taken multiple times, will the results be the same?). No information is
provided to suggest that the gastric cancer biomarker is unreliable.
