A normal (Gaussian) distribution refers to a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution with a
fixed proportion of observations lying within a certain distance of the mean. This distance is
called the standard deviation (SD) and reflects the degree of dispersion from the mean.
According to the properties of this distribution, 68% of observations lie within 1 SD on either
side of the mean, with half (ie, 68/2 = 34%) above and half (34%) below the mean. The
remaining 32% (= 100% - 68%) lie outside 1 SD from the mean, with half (ie, 32/2 = 16%)
above and the other half (16%) below 1 SD from the mean. In addition, 95% of all
observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SDs of the
mean. This is the 68-95-99.7 rule.

For men age 35-44 in this sample, the mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 120 mm Hg with
an SD of 20mm Hg. Therefore, subjects with SBP >140 mm Hg (to fit the proposed definition
of hypertension) represent observations >1 SD above the mean. Based on the 68-95-99.7
rule, 32% of observations (= 100% — 68%) lie outside 1 SD from the mean, with half (16%)
above and half (16%) below 1 SD from the mean. Therefore, 16% of men age 35-44 have
SBP >140 mm Hg.

(Choices B, C, D, and E) Based on the 68-95-99.7 rule, 34% of subjects lie either 1 SD
above the mean or 1 SD below the mean. In men age 35-44:
