An intern in the endocrinology department is asked to complete a chart review of cholesterol
levels of all patients hospitalized with diabetes mellitus-related cardiovascular complications in
the past 6 months. The intern's preliminary data analysis reveals that there were 400 such
patients, and that serum cholesterol levels were normally distributed among the patients with a
mean of 220 mg/dL and a standard deviation of 10 mg/dL. Based on these results, how many
patients in this study would be expected to have serum cholesterol >240 mg/dL?
