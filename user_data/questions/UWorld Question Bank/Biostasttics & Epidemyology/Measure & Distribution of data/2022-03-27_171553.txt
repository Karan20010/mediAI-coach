A normal (Gaussian) distribution is defined as a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution curve.
One of the most important attributes of the normal distribution is the "68/95/99 rule," which
states that 68% of all observations lie within 1 standard deviation (SD) of the mean, 95% within
2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% within 3 SDs of the mean. The SD is a measure of dispersion
or variance (how far the measurements are from one another). In this example, the mean
folate level is 5.0 ng/mL with a SD of 0.5 ng/mL. Therefore:

¢ 4.5-5.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 1 SD of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 — 1*0.5 = 4.5 ng/mL
and 5 + 1*0.5 = 5.5 ng/mL);

¢ 4.0-6.0 ng/mL is the range within +/- 2 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 — 2*0.5 = 4.0
ng/mL and 5.0 + 2*0.5 = 6.0 ng/mL)

¢ 3.5-6.5 ng/mL is the range within +/- 3 SDs of 5.0 ng/mL (given that 5.0 — 3*0.5 = 3.5
ng/mL and 5.0 + 3*0.5 = 6.5 ng/mL)

Based on the 68/95/99 rule, approximately 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean,
so between 4.0 and 6.0 ng/mL in this case. These are helpful approximations; to be more
precise, 95% of the observations lie within 1.96 SDs of the mean and 95.45% of the
observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean.
