Question Id: 1765
¢ Precision (reliability) is the ability of a test to reproduce identical or similar results with

repeated measurements (bottom half of figure).

¢ Accuracy (validity) is the ability of a test to measure what it is supposed to measure. For

a new test to be accurate, its results should be equivalent to the results obtained with a
gold standard (eg, best conventional test available) on the same individual (right half of
figure).

In this case, repeated measurements of the same blood sample yielded nearly identical

values; therefore, the new device has high precision. However, none of the measurements

with the new device were equivalent to the results obtained with the gold standard (ie, the

measurements are incorrect), meaning the new device has low accuracy.

(Choices C and F) Sensitivity is defined as the percentage of diseased individuals who are
correctly identified (ie, proportion of subjects who have a positive test among all those with
disease), whereas specificity is defined as the percentage of healthy individuals who are
correctly identified (ie, proportion of subjects who have a negative test among all those without
disease). Poor accuracy or precision can lead to low test sensitivity and specificity. However,
no information is provided to determine the sensitivity or specificity of the new device

compared to the gold standard test.
