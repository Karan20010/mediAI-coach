(Choice A) The mean (or average) can be quite sensitive to outliers, especially in the case of
small datasets and extreme outliers. For instance, the mean of the 20 initial measurements is
10.8 mm Hg (obtained by calculating [9 x 10 mm Hg + 6 x 11 mm Hg + 5 x 12 mm Hg] / 20).
With an additional measurement of 26 mm Hg, the mean would become 11.5 mm Hg (obtained
by calculating [1 x 26 mm Hg + 9 x 10 mm Hg + 6 x 11 mm Hg + 5 x 12 mm Hg] / 21).

(Choice C) The range is equal to the maximal value minus the minimal value and would
clearly be affected by outliers. With the 20 initial measurements, the range is 12 mm Hg — 10
mm Hg =2 mm Hg. If the next measurement is 26 mm Hg, then the range will be 26 mm Hg —
10 mm Hg = 16 mm Hg.

(Choices D and E) The standard deviation and variance are measures of dispersion, which
reflect how spread out the values in a dataset are from one another. The standard deviation
and variance tend to be sensitive to outliers because outliers increase the dispersion of
datasets.

Educational objective:

An outlier is defined as an extreme and unusual observed value in a dataset. It can affect
measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as measures of dispersion
(standard deviation, variance). Modes tend to be resistant to outliers.
