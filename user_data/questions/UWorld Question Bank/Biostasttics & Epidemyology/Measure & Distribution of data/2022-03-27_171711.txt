RR = (RiSKeamen / RiSKeowa) = (0.08/0.12) = 0.67

Therefore, RRR is:
RRR = 1 - 0.67 = 0.33

(Choice A) 0.08 represents the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the new drug group
(6/75 = 0.08, or 8%), not RRR.

(Choice B) 0.10 represents the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the entire study (ie, both
groups: [6 + 9]/ [75 + 75] = 0.10, or 10%).

(Choice C) 0.12 represents the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the placebo group (9/75
= 0.12, or 12%).

(Choice E) 0.67 represents the RR, the ratio of the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the
new drug group to the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the placebo group (0.08/0.12 =
0.67, or 67%).

Educational objective:
Relative risk reduction (RRR) measures how much a treatment reduces the risk of an
unfavorable outcome. Two methods to calculate it are:
