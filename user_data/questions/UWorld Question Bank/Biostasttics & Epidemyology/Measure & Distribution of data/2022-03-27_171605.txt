Note that SD is used to describe individual observations in a dataset. A closely related
measure called standard error (SE) is used to show how closely sample means are related to
population means; SE = SD / Vn, where n is the sample size. In this example, if SE had been
given instead of SD, investigators would be 95% confident that the true mean folate level in the
underlying population lies within the mean +/- 2 SE (which is also the range that would include
95% of sample means calculated from repeated samples of the same size taken from that
population).

(Choices A and D) These limits are asymmetric and are therefore inconsistent with a normal
distribution curve around the mean.

(Choice B) Approximately 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SDs of the mean (3.5-6.5
ng/mL).

(Choice E) Approximately 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the mean (4.5-5.5
ng/mL).

Educational objective:
In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution curve, 68% of observations lie within 1 standard
deviation (SD) of the mean, 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% of

observations lie within 3 SDs of the mean.
