exposure and disease.
(Choice B) Median survival time is calculated in cohort studies or clinical trials and is used to
compare the median time to an event of interest (eg, TD) in 22 groups of individuals (eg, those
not vaccinated and those vaccinated). The purpose of this study is to assess the association
between exposure to a risk modifier (eg, vaccination) and disease occurrence (eg, TD), not to
compare the median time to develop the disease (eg, TD) between exposed and nonexposed
groups.

(Choice C) Odds ratio is calculated in case-control studies, where 2 groups of individuals are
initially identified as "cases" or "controls" according to an outcome (eg, disease of interest),
and then the frequency of exposure to the risk factors is compared between cases and
controls to estimate the association between the risk factors and the outcomes.

Educational objective:
A ccohort study is used to compare incidence of disease between exposed and nonexposed
individuals. Acommon measure of association in cohort studies is the relative risk.
