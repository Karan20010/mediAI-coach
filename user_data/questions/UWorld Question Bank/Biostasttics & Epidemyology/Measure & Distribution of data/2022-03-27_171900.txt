Blood pressure measurements are obtained from a sample of individuals with no known
medical conditions. For systolic blood pressure (SBP), the mean measurements and
associated standard deviations (SDs) are shown by age group for men and women:
Men Women
Age group Mean SBP (mm Hg)+SD Mean SBP (mm Hg) + SD
35-44 120 + 20 124 +18
45-54 131+ 21 137 + 24
55-64 141419 140 + 20

If hypertension is defined as SBP >140 mm Hg, approximately what percentage of men age
35-44 in this sample will be classified as having hypertension, assuming a normal (Gaussian)
distribution?
