The symmetrical bell-shaped curve is usually cited as the prototypical curve describing the
distribution of a continuous variable. However, in actual research scenarios, continuous
variables often have asymmetrical distributions. When a distribution curve is asymmetric, it
is either positively or negatively skewed:

¢ Ina positively skewed distribution, there is an increased number of observations with
larger-than-expected magnitudes (ie, extreme values) that shift the mean toward the
right, producing a longer slope of the curve ("tail") on the positive side of the distribution.

¢ Ina negatively skewed distribution, there is an increased number of observations with
smaller-than-expected magnitudes that shift the mean toward the left, producing a
longer slope of the curve ("tail") on the negative side of the distribution.

In general, in a positively skewed distribution, the mean is the most shifted in the positive
direction, followed by the median and then the mode (mode < median < mean). In sucha
situation, the median often reflects a central tendency better than the mean does.

(Choices A and B) In perfectly normal distribution curves where there is no skew, all 3
measures of central tendency are precisely equal: mean = median = mode. If a minor skew is
present, the 3 measures are approximately equal.
