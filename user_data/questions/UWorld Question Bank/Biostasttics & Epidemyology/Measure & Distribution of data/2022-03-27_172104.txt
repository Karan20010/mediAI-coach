‘ the right).
5
6 (Choices A and D) The values 80 and 100 mm Hg are not measures of the center of the
7
8 dataset.
(Choice C) To find the mean of a dataset, add all of the observations and divide that sum by
the number of observations. In this case, the mean is (75 + 75 + 80 + 90 + 110 + 110) /6 =90
mm Hg.

(Choice E) Another measure of the center of a dataset is the mode. Finding the mode is
easy because it is the most frequent value of a dataset. In our scenario, the dataset is
"bimodal" because 75 and 110 mm Hg are each listed twice.

Educational objective:
The median is the value that is located in the precise center of an ordered dataset. It
separates the right half of the data from the left half.
