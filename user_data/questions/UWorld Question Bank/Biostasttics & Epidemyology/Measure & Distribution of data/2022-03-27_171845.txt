An outlier is defined as an extreme and unusual value observed in a dataset. It may be the

a result of a recording error, a measurement error, or a natural phenomenon. In this case, the

value of 26 mm Hg is an outlier as all the other values lie between 10 and 12 mm Hg. An
outlier can affect measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) as well as measures of
dispersion (standard deviation, variance).

This patient had 20 initial measurements that were all between 10 and 12 mm Hg. Although it
is not required to answer this question correctly, a numerical example can help to explain the
effect of an outlier such as 26 mm Hg. Assume that the patient's 20 initial measurements
were: 9 measurements of 10 mm Hg, 6 measurements of 11 mm Hg, and 5 measurements of
12 mm Hg. The mode is the most frequently observed data point, so the mode for this initial
dataset is 10 mm Hg (because this value is observed 9 times whereas the other 2 values are
observed 6 times and 5 times). If the next measurement is 26 mm Hg, the mode would remain
10 mm Hg because this would still be the most commonly observed value. Therefore, the
mode would remain unchanged. The mode tends to be resistant to outliers because outliers
are not likely to affect the most frequently observed value in a dataset.

(Choice A) The mean (or average) can be quite sensitive to outliers, especially in the case of

small datasets and extreme outliers. For instance, the mean of the 20 initial measurements is
