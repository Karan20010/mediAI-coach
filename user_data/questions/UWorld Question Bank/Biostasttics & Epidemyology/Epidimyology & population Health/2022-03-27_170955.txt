Incident cases represent new cases diagnosed in a given period of time. Prevalent cases
are the total number of cases (both old and new) at a particular point in time. For a non-
transmissible condition such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the number of incident
cases will not be changed by any kind of treatment because the disease has already
developed when the treatment is started (and treatment of existing patients will not prevent
new patients from developing CLL). Any treatment that prolongs survival but does not cure the
disease will increase the number of prevalent cases due to an increase in the number of
afflicted (but still living) individuals over time.

Differences in terminology may lead to confusion. Incident cases and prevalent cases are
often referred to as simply "incidence" and "prevalence." Incidence can also represent the
number of new cases divided by the population at risk over a period of time and can be
converted into a rate (eg, annual incidence per 10,000 population). Prevalence typically refers
to point prevalence (total number of cases at a particular point in time) as opposed to period
prevalence (over a period of time). The specific meaning is often clear from the context.
