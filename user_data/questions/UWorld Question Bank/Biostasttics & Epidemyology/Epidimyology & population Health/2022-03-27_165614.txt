disease) among diabetic individuals. However, a decrease in hospitalization rate would not
necessarily be associated with reduced mortality and increasing disease prevalence.

(Choice D) Increased accuracy of diagnostic testing would affect both the prevalence and
incidence of a disease as it changes the rate at which new cases are detected.

(Choice E) Increased exposure to diabetes risk factors would likely increase both disease
incidence and prevalence.

(Choice G) Selective survival bias occurs in case-control studies when cases are selected
from the entire disease population instead of from just those that are newly diagnosed. For
instance, a study on cancer survival that is not limited to newly diagnosed patients could
contain a higher proportion of relatively benign malignancies, as these patients generally live

longer.
