There appears to be an outbreak as almost a third of the attendees (28/100) developed
diarrhea and vomiting; this is clearly a larger number than expected. The attack rate is the
ratio of the number of individuals who become ill divided by the number of individuals who are
at risk of contracting that illness; it is often used in outbreak investigations. The attack rate for
potato salad corresponds to the proportion of attendees who became ill out of the total number
of attendees who had potato salad (alone or in combination with other food items).

Total number of attendees who had potato salad

= Number of attendees who had potato salad only + number of attendees who had
hamburgers and potato salad + number of attendees who had hotdogs and potato salad +
number of attendees who had hamburgers, hotdogs, and potato salad

=10+25+8+30

=73

Among those, the number who became ill was 25 (3 out of the 10 who had potato salad only +
5 out of the 25 who had hamburgers and potato salad + 3 out of the 8 who had hotdogs and

potato salad + 14 out of the 30 who had hamburgers, hot dogs, and potato salad = 25).
Therefore, the attack rate for potato salad was: (25/73) x 100 = 34%.

(Choice B) There were 27 attendees who did not eat potato salad: the 15 who had
hamburgers only and the 12 who had hotdogs only. Of those, a total of 3 (2 out of the 15 who
ate hamburgers only + 1 out of the 12 who ate hotdogs only = 3) became ill. Therefore, the
attack rate among those who did not eat potato salad was: (3/27) x 100 = 11%. Despite the
fact that these individuals only ate hotdogs and hamburgers, a percentage of them still
became ill, probably as a result of some contamination of these food items with the potato
salad.

For the sake of completion, the attack rates for the other individual food items or combinations
of food items are shown in the following table (they do not need to be calculated to arrive at
the correct answer):

Overall

The food item responsible for an outbreak often (though not always) has the largest attack rate
and the largest difference in attack rates between those who consumed the item and those
who did not. In this example, as calculated above, the difference in attack rate between those
who had potato salad and those who did not was: 34% — 11% = 23%. As seen in the exhibit,
the differences in attack rates were smaller for hamburgers (7%) and hotdogs (16%). It is
possible that potato salad is the source of the outbreak.

Educational objective:

The attack rate is the ratio of the number of people who contract an illness divided by the
number of people who are at risk of contracting that illness.
