: Drugs A and B are 2 new experimental drugs being tested for the treatment of a novel
6 respiratory viral infection that causes acute respiratory failure and death in children. Part of
z the testing process is to analyze the 2-week survival after treatment to determine the clinical
9 efficacy of the experimental drugs. A total of 60 children recently diagnosed with the disease

: s are randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive Drug A, Drug B, or placebo. The absolute

risk reduction of Drug A compared to placebo was found to be 0.05, whereas the absolute risk

reduction of Drug B compared to placebo was found to be 0.20. Based on these results, which
of the following statements comparing the effectiveness of Drugs A and B in treating children
infected with the novel virus is most appropriate?

©) A. Drugs A and B require treating the same number of children to prevent 1 additional
death, so they are equally effective

©) B. Drug A requires treating fewer children to prevent 1 additional death compared to
Drug B, so Drug Ais less effective than Drug B

(©) C. Drug A requires treating fewer children to prevent 1 additional death compared to
Drug B, so Drug Ais more effective than Drug B

©) D. Drug A requires treating more children to prevent 1 additional death compared to
