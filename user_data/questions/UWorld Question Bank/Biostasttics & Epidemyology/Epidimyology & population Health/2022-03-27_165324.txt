Educational objective:

¢ The relative risk (RR) is a measure of association: RR < 1.0 indicates a lower risk of
disease in the exposed group relative to the nonexposed group; RR = 1.0 indicates no
association between exposure and disease; and RR > 1.0 indicates a greater risk of
disease in the exposed group relative to the nonexposed group.

¢ Aconfidence interval (Cl) that includes the null value for an RR (ie, RR = 1) is not
statistically significant, and a Cl that excludes the null value (ie, RR = 1) is statistically
significant.
