Educational objective:

The accuracy of screening or diagnostic tests is quantified by the area under the ROC curve
(AUC). The more accurate the test is (ie, higher sensitivity and specificity), the closer the AUC
value is to 1.0. Tests with higher AUCs are more accurate than tests with lower AUCs.
