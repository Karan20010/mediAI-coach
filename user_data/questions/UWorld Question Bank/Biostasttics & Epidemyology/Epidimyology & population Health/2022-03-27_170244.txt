The given table is incorrectly formatted (ie, high intake should be in the first row rather than in
the second row of exposure status), so it is necessary to reformat the table.

Probiotic yogurt intake
; GDM + | GDM -
during pregnancy
High A 66
(a) (b)
Low 82 60
(c) (d)
Total 123 126

The odds of high intake of yogurt in women with GDM and women without GDM are:

¢ Odds of high intake of yogurt in cases: a/c = 41/82 = 0.50

¢ Odds of high intake of yogurt in controls: b/d = 66/60 = 1.10

Therefore, the OR is:

OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls) = (a/c) / (b/d) = 0.50 / Activate Windows
