Therefore, RRnoavsnon = 0.40 / 0.10 = 4. This means that the risk of COPD is four times greater

for moderate smokers compared to nonsmokers.

(Choice A) 0.10 is the given RR for nonsmokers compared to heavy smokers: RRponvsneaw-

(Choice B) 0.25 is the RR for nonsmokers compared to moderate smokers: RRoonvsmos = 0.10 /

0.40 = 0.25, meaning that the risk of COPD is 75% (ie, 100% — 25%) lower in nonsmokers

compared to moderate smokers.

(Choice C) 0.40 is the given RR for moderate smokers compared to heavy smokers: RRooavs

(Choice D) 2.5 is the RR for heavy smokers compared to moderate smokers (RRoeavy vemos); it is

the inverse of the given RRoavsneay (i€, FRRneaw vemos = 1 / 0.40 = 2.5).

(Choice F) 10 is the RR for heavy smokers compared to nonsmokers (RRoeawvsnon); it is the

inverse of the giVEN RRoonveneay (I€, RRRaeavvsnon = 1 / 0.10 = 10).
