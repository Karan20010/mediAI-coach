In this question, the population pyramid has a rectangular shape that tapers off significantly
only in the advanced age cohorts. This indicates that the population has gone through a
decline in both birth and mortality rates, resulting in a longer life expectancy (Choices A
and E). When a population reaches a balance between its birth and mortality rates (ie,
rectangular shape), it is neither growing nor shrinking; therefore, it is a stable population
(Choice B).

(Choice C) Asmall proportion of older cohorts (eg, age 275) is expected in any population;
this tapering off at the top of the pyramid occurs due to a natural increase in age-related
mortality rather than migration of older people.

Educational objective:

There are three types of population pyramids: expansive (ie, young and growing population;
high birth and mortality rates), stationary (ie, stable population; declining birth rates and low
mortality rates), and constrictive (ie, shrinking population; significantly low birth and mortality

rates).
