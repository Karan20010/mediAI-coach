The relative risk (RR) is commonly used in cohort and experimental studies as a measure of
association between a risk factor or treatment and a disease or outcome. RR is equal to the
risk of an outcome or disease (eg, infection) in a group exposed to a treatment (eg, Treatment
A) divided by the risk of the same outcome or disease in a group exposed to a different
treatment (eg, Treatment B).

RR = (risk of disease in Treatment A) / (risk of disease in Treatment B)

The RR may be interpreted as follows:

e RR < 1.0 indicates that exposure to Treatment A is associated with a decrease in risk of
disease with respect to Treatment B.

¢ RR = 1.0 (null value) indicates that there is no association between the treatments and
risk of disease.

¢ RR > 1.0 indicates that exposure to Treatment A is associated with an increase in risk of
disease with respect to Treatment B.

The confidence interval (Cl) of a RR indicates, with a certain confidence level, whether a
given RR is statistically different from the null value (ie, RR = 1). ACI that includes the null

value (ie, RR = 1) is not statistically significant, and a Cl that excludes the null value (ie,
