Specificity = TN / (TN + FP)

5 In this question, 255 out of 300 (ie, 45 + 255) patients without disease X had a negative test

: (ie, TN = 255) and 45 had a positive test (ie, FP = 45). Therefore, the specificity of the new

8 testis:

10 Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 255 / (255 + 45) = 255 / 300 = 0.85 (or 85%)

12 The specificity of the standard test is 73% and of the new test is 85%. Therefore, the

= researchers achieved an increase in specificity of about 85% - 73% = 12% (Choices B, C,

15 and E).

17 (Choice A) Contrary to positive and negative predictive values, which are influenced by the

: prevalence of disease in the population, sensitivity and specificity are intrinsic test
+ 20 performance characteristic that do not depend on disease prevalence.

+ 2 Educational objective:
The specificity of a test is its ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease.

25 Specificity can be calculated as follows: specificity = true negatives / (true negatives + false

26 ne

- positives).
