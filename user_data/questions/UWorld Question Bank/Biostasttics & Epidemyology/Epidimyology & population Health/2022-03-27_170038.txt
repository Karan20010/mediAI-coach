(Choice D) 0.80 is the test's specificity. Specificity is equal to TN / (TN + FP) and describes
the proportion of individuals who do not have the disease for which the test result is negative.
It is an intrinsic measure of the test's ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease,
but by itself, it does not provide enough information to interpret a negative test result ina
particular individual.

Educational objective:

Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability that an individual does not have a disease
given a negative test result. It is equal to the number of individuals who do not have the
disease and who have a negative test result (ie, true negatives [TN]) divided by the total
number of individuals with a negative test result (TN + false negatives [FN]): NPV = TN/(TN +
FN).
