FN = (TP + FN)- TP
Given that 200 patients truly have ovarian cancer ("positive condition"), this means that (TP +

FN) = 200. To calculate TP (and subsequently determine FN), it is possible to use the
sensitivity of the test (ie, a test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease), given

by:
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
In this case, the sensitivity of the test is TP / (TP + FN) = 80% (or 0.80). Using this
information, the number of TPs can be calculated:
Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN)
0.80 = TP / 200
TP = 160
Now the number of FN can be determined:
FN = (TP + FN) - TP = 200 - 160 = 40

The number of TP and FN can be more quickly calculated using the following equations:

TP = (Sensitivity) x (Number of patients who truly have the disease)

FN = (1 — Sensitivity) x (Number of patients who truly have the disease)
