3 (Choice B) There were 27 attendees who did not ea potato salad: the 15 who had
: hamburgers only and the 12 who had hotdogs only. Of those, a total of 3 (2 out of the 15 who
6 ate hamburgers only + 1 out of the 12 who ate hotdogs only = 3) became ill. Therefore, the
z attack rate among those who did not eat potato salad was: (3/27) x 100 = 11%. Despite the
9 fact that these individuals only ate hotdogs and hamburgers, a percentage of them still
10
mT became ill, probably as a result of some contamination of these food items with the potato
v2 salad.
