= compared to women receiving placebo (ie, nonexposed) is 0.80. Because this RR is <1.0, the
5 exposure decreases the risk of disease. The RR of 0.80 indicates that adding TXA decreases
: the risk of PPH by 20% (ie, 1 - 0.80 = 0.20) (Choices A and B).
: (Choice D) In this study, 0.80 represents the relative risk (not absolute risk) of PPH among
to women receiving TXA compared to those receiving placebo. For instance, the actual risk of
= PPH could be 1.6% with TXA compared to 2.0% with placebo, producing the RR of 0.80 (ie,
13 RR = 1.6 / 2.0 = 0.80).

15 (Choice E) The reported Cl for RR in this study is 0.66-0.96. It excludes the null value (ie, RR
: = 1.0); therefore, adding TXA has a statistically significant effect on the risk of PPH.
. Educational objective:
20 Relative risk is the ratio of the probability of an event (eg, disease outcome) occurring in the

exposed group (eg, treatment group) versus the probability of the event occurring in the

+ 23 unexposed group (eg, control group).
