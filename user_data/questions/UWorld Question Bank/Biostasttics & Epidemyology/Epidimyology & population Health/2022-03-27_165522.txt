Cumulative incidence (Cl) is calculated as the total number of new cases of a disease (eg,
neurodegenerative condition) over a specific period (eg, during 2016) divided by the number
of people at risk at the beginning of the period. It does not account for deaths in the period
under study because the patients who died were, at some point in the intervening period, still
considered part of the baseline population at risk for the disease. In this case, there were
3,980,000 people at risk (ie, 4,000,000 - 20,000 already with the disease) at the beginning of
2016, and 7,000 new cases of the disease occurred over the 1-year period being analyzed.
Therefore, the Cl is:

Cl = 7,000 / (4,000,000 - 20,000) = 7,000 / 3,980,000
Unlike incidence rate (which is typically reported as the number of cases per person-year), Cl

does not incorporate time into the denominator; it is simply the proportion of at-risk individuals
who contract the disease over the specified period.

(Choice A) The disease-specific mortality (in this example: 1,000 / 4,000,000) is the number
of deaths attributable to a disease per year divided by the total population.

(Choice B) The Cl does not account for deaths in the period under study. In this case, the
numerator is 7,000, not 6,000.
