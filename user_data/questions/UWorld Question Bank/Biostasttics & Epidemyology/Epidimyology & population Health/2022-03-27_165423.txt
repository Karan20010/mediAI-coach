A population pyramid displays the percentage of individuals in each age cohort to describe
the current population profile, and to project how the population will increase/decrease in the

future. Every population pyramid is unique, but most fit into one of three general categories.

¢ Expansive populations have high birth and mortality rates and short life
expectancies. Therefore, they show a larger percentage of people in younger cohorts (ie,
graph has a broad bottom and narrow top). These populations are young and growing,
and their pyramids characterize many developing countries.

Stationary populations have declining birth rates, low mortality rates, and long life
expectancies. Therefore, they show a somewhat equal percentage of people in each age
cohort (ie, graph has a somewhat rectangular shape). These populations are stable (ie,
neither growing nor shrinking), and their pyramids are characteristic of many developed
countries.

Constrictive populations have significantly low birth and mortality rates, and long life
expectancies. Therefore, they show a smaller percentage of people in younger cohorts
(ie, graph has a narrower bottom). These populations are shrinking, and their pyramids
are characteristic of very advanced countries with a high level of literacy, easy access to
birth control measures, and exceptional health and medical resources.
