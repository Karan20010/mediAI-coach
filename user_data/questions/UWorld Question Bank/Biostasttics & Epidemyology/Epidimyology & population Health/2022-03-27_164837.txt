There appears to be an outbreak as almost a third of the attendees (28/100) developed
diarrhea and vomiting; this is clearly a larger number than expected. The attack rate is the
ratio of the number of individuals who become ill divided by the number of individuals who are
at risk of contracting that illness; it is often used in outbreak investigations. The attack rate for
potato salad corresponds to the proportion of attendees who became ill out of the total number
of attendees who had potato salad (alone or in combination with other food items).

Total number of attendees who had potato salad

= Number of attendees who had potato salad only + number of attendees who had
hamburgers and potato salad + number of attendees who had hotdogs and potato salad +
number of attendees who had hamburgers, hotdogs, and potato salad

=10+25+8+30

=73

Among those, the number who became ill was 25 (3 out of the 10 who had potato salad only +
5 out of the 25 who had hamburgers and potato salad + 3 out of the 8 who had hotdogs and
potato salad + 14 out of the 30 who had hamburgers, hot dogs, and potato salad = 25).
Therefore, the attack rate for potato salad was: (25/73) x 100 = 34%.
