Predictive values depend on the prevalence of the disease in the study population; as the
disease prevalence increases, PPV increases and NPV decreases, and vice versa.

(Choice A) 5/ (5 + 95) is the false negative rate (FNR). FNR is equal to FN / (FN + TP) and
describes the proportion of individuals with a known positive condition for which the test result
is negative. It is also known as the miss rate.

(Choice C) 95/ (95 + 5) is the test's sensitivity. Sensitivity is equal to TP / (TP + FN) and
describes the proportion of individuals with a known positive condition for which the test result
is positive. It is an intrinsic measure of the test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the
disease, but by itself, it does not provide enough information to interpret a positive test result in
a particular individual.

(Choice D) 720 / (720 + 180) is the test's specificity. Specificity is equal to TN / (TN + FP)
and describes the proportion of individuals with a known negative condition for which the test
result is negative.

(Choice E) 720/ (720 + 5) is the test's negative predictive value (NPV). NPV is equal to TN /
(TN + FN) and describes the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who really do
not have the disease.
