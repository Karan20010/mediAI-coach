The odds of an event are related to the probability P of that event, with odds = P/(1-P). For
example, the probability of rolling a single die and getting a 1 is 1/6, but the odds of rolling a 1
is 1/5. The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association used in case-control studies to
compare the odds of exposure in cases (ie, individuals with disease) relative to controls (ie,
individuals without disease):

OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls)
In this study, the disease of interest is gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), so cases are
women with GDM, and controls are women without GDM. The exposure of interest is
probiotic yogurt intake before or during pregnancy. More specifically, the OR of interest is
the odds of high intake of yogurt in cases (ie, women with GDM) relative to the odds of high
intake of yogurt in controls (ie, women without GDM).
A shortcut to calculate the OR when a contingency table has a standard format (ie, exposure
of interest in the first row of exposure status and cases in the first column of disease status) is
the following:

OR = (a/c) / (b/d)

The given table is incorrectly formatted (ie, high intake should be in the first row rather than in ctivate V
