Relative risk (RR) is a measure of association between exposure to a risk modifier (eg,
treatment) and an outcome (eg, disease course) that is commonly used in cohort and
experimental studies. RR is the risk of an outcome (eg, postpartum hemorrhage [PPH]) in the
exposed group (eg, tranexamic acid [TXA]) divided by the risk of the same outcome or disease

in the nonexposed group (eg, placebo):
RR = (risk of disease in exposed group) / (risk of disease in nonexposed group)
The RR may be interpreted as follows:

¢ RR <1.0 indicates that the exposure decreases the risk of disease.
¢ RR = 1.0 (null value) indicates that the exposure has no effect on the risk of disease.
¢ RR >1.0 indicates that the exposure increases the risk of disease.

The confidence interval (Cl) of RR indicates, with a certain confidence level (eg, 95%),
whether a given RR is statistically different from the null value (ie, RR = 1.0). ACI that
includes the null value (ie, RR = 1.0) is not statistically significant, and a Cl that excludes the

null value is statistically significant.

In this study, the RR of PPH (ie, disease) among women receiving TXA (ie, exposed)
compared to women receiving placebo (ie, nonexposed) is 0.80. Because this RR is <1.0, the
