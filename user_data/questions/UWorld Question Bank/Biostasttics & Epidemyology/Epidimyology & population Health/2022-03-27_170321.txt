The number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients who need to be treated with a
specific drug (eg, medication X) to prevent an additional negative event (eg, 1 fewer
patients with essential hypertension who develop proteinuria within 5 years of diagnosis) when
compared with a control group (eg, standard antihypertensive therapy). NNT is the inverse of
the absolute risk reduction (ARR):
NNT =1/ARR

The ARR describes the difference in risk of an unfavorable event (eg, development of
proteinuria within 5 years of hypertension diagnosis) between the treatment group (eg,
medication X + standard antihypertensive therapy) and the control group (eg, standard
antihypertensive therapy):

ARR & (RiSKesiro: — RiSKresinen)
In this question, 100 — 90 = 10 out of 100 patients in the control group developed proteinuria
within 5 years of hypertension diagnosis, SO RiSKeon is 10/100 = 0.10. Similarly, 100 - 97 =3
out of 100 patients in the treatment group developed proteinuria within 5 years of hypertension
diagnosis, SO RiSKreamen iS 3/100 = 0.03. Therefore, the ARR for development of proteinuria

within 5 years of hypertension diagnosis in the treatment group is:
