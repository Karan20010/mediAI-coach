The accuracy of screening or diagnostic tests (defined as the number of true positives plus
true negatives divided by the number of all observations) is generally quantified by the area
under the ROC curve (AUC). ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves are created by
plotting sensitivity (true-positive rate) against 1 — specificity (false-positive rate) for various
cutoff thresholds (ie, the value that determines if a given test result is positive or negative). A
highly accurate test is highly sensitive (high true-positive rate) and highly specific (low false-
positive rate). The more accurate the test is (ie, the higher sensitivity and specificity), the
closer the AUC value is to 1.0. Therefore, tests with higher AUCs are more accurate than

tests with lower AUCs.

In this study, the ROCs for the tests (ie, biomarkers) are not provided; however, it is possible to
draw conclusions about the accuracy of each biomarker based on the values given for their
AUCs. Biomarker 3 has the largest AUC (0.879) compared to biomarker 1 (0.603),
biomarker 2 (0.758), biomarker 4 (0.763), and biomarker 5 (0.756). Therefore, biomarker 3 is
the most accurate test of the 5 tests for Barrett esophagus screening.

(Choices A, B, D, and E) Biomarker 3 (0.879) is more accurate than biomarker 4 (0.763);
biomarker 4 is more accurate than biomarker 2 (0.758); biomarker 2 is more accurate than
biomarker 5 (0.756); and biomarker 5 is more accurate than biomarker 1 (0.603).
