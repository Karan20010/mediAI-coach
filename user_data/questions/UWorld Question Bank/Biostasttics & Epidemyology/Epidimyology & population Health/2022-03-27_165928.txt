Question Id: 19665

The relative risk (RR) is the measure of association between the exposure to a risk factor
and an outcome or disease commonly used in cohort and experimental studies. RR is equal
to the risk of an outcome (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD)]) in an exposed
group (eg, moderate smokers) divided by the risk of the same outcome in a nonexposed group
(eg, nonsmokers).

RRooavsnon = (risk of disease in moderate smokers) / (risk of disease in nonsmokers) = RiSKno /
RisKron

In this case, RRooavenon Must be calculated from the RRs for COPD and smoking reported in the
given cohort study:
e RR for nonsmokers compared to heavy smokers: RRoonveneay = RiSKron / RiSKneay = 0.10

e RR for moderate smokers compared to heavy smokers: RRoosvsneay = RiSKmos / RiSKneay = 0.40

RRooavsneaw ANA RRronvsneay have the same comparison group (ie, denominator: Risk,... for heavy

smokers). Therefore, dividing RRmoavsneay DY RRronvsneay FESUIES IN RRovvsnon (IG, RISKmos / RiSKnon)-
