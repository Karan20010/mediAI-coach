Incidence corresponds to the number of new cases of a disease diagnosed in a population at
risk over a given time period. In 1997, incidence was >10 new cases/100,000 population for
hepatitis A virus (HAV), <5/100,000 for hepatitis B virus (HBV), and <3/100,000 for hepatitis C
virus (HCV). Assuming, as instructed, that the entire United States (US) population is at risk
(reasonable theory given low number of hepatitis cases among the total population), then, in
1997 (US population ~275 million):

New HAV cases in 1997 = >10 new cases/100,000 population x 275,000,000 population =

>27,500

New HBV cases in 1997 = <5/100,000 x 275,000,000 = <13,750

New HCV cases in 1997 = <3/100,000 x 275,000,000 = <8,250

There were thousands more new HAV (>27,500) than HBV and HCV cases combined
(<13,750 + <8,250 = <22,000). The calculations incorporating total population (included for
completion) are not needed to answer the question.

After 2006, HBV incidence surpassed HAV and HCV incidence. However, no information can
be deduced regarding prevalence, which is the total number of cases in the population

(Choice A). Compared to new HBV cases, there were approximately just as many new HAV
