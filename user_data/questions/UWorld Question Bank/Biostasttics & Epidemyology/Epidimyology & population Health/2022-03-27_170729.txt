Absolute risk reduction (ARR) describes the difference in risk of an unfavorable outcome
between the treatment group (eg, new treatment) and the control group (eg, standard
treatment):

ARR = (RisKcsiai — RiSKseamen)

In this example, RiSKeono is the risk of death from any cause in the group treated with surgical
aortic valve replacement and is determined by dividing the number of deaths in that group (68)
by the total number of patients in that group (357). RiSKreatmen is the risk of death from any
cause in the group treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and is
determined by dividing 57 by 390. Therefore, the ARR for death from any cause in patients
treated with TAVR compared to those treated with surgical replacement is calculated as
follows:

ARR = (68/357) — (57/390) = 0.044
ARR can be used to determine the number needed to treat (NNT), calculated as:

NNT =1/ARR

NNT is the number of patients who need to be treated with a treatment (eg, TAVR) to prevent 1
