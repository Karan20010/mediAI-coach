(Choices C and D) The oral nitrate preparations do not have high serum protein binding or
volume of distribution.

(Choice E) Isosorbide dinitrate has rapid and nearly complete intestinal absorption. Its low
bioavailability is due to considerable first-pass hepatic metabolism.

Educational objective:

Isosorbide dinitrate has a low bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism
prior to release in systemic circulation. Sublingual nitroglycerin is absorbed directly from oral
mucosa into the venous circulation and has a higher bioavailability.
