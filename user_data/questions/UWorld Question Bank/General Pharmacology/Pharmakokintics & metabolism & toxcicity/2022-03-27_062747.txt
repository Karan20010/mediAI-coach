serum drug levels.

(Choice C) Increased biliary excretion of the blue formulation would be expected to decrease
peak serum levels, but would not explain the delay in peak levels relative to the red curve.

(Choice D) Drugs that are excreted into the bile can undergo enterohepatic cycling, which can
prolong the drug's effect longer than expected given the drug's half-life. However, increased
enterohepatic cycling would not explain the initial delay in peak serum levels seen in the blue
curve.

(Choice E) Reduced first-pass metabolism by the blue formulation would result in higher peak
serum levels compared to the red curve due to increased quantities of drug entering the
circulation.

Educational objective:

Sustained-release drug preparations have reduced and delayed peak levels compared to
immediate-release preparations due to slower absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.
Dampening of peak levels and prolonged absorption of the drug help maintain effective drug
levels while minimizing toxicity.
