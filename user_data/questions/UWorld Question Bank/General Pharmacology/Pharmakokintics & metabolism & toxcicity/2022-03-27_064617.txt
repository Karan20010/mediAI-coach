more divided doses. In this example, 4 grams are administered every 24 hours, either in 2

doses (12-hr regimen) or 4 doses (6-hr regimen). Therefore, the more frequent 6-hour
regimen would result in lower average plasma drug levels.

(Choice C) Patient compliance is increased when the frequency of dosing is minimized. Only
2 doses per day are needed with the 12-hour regimen; however, the 6-hour regimen needs 4
doses and is likely to be more disruptive to the patient's schedule.

(Choice E) The therapeutic window refers to the range of drug dosages that have an
appropriate clinical effect. It begins at the lowest dose at which the drug is effective and ends
at the highest dose without significant toxic effects. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window
are often dosed more frequently to prevent large swings in plasma concentration.

Educational objective:
Drug dosing regimens with more frequent dosing have lower peak and average drug levels,
which can help reduce drug toxicity.
