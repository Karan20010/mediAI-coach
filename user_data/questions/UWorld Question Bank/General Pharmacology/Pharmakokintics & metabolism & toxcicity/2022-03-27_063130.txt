Researchers develop a novel glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin that is bactericidal
against many gram-positive bacteria. From animal studies, they determine that the effective
drug dosage is 5 mg/kg/day administered intravenously in divided doses. In a clinical trial, the
antibiotic is administered to adult and neonatal patients with gram-positive infections. The
drug is found to be effective in adults but not in neonates. During further analysis, plasma
concentrations of the drug are measured in both groups, with the results shown in the image
