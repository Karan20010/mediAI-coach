This patient has muscle tenderness and weakness. The dark urine suggests myoglobinuria
due to myocyte necrosis. In the context of ongoing statin therapy for hyperlipidemia, this
presentation likely represents statin myopathy. Statin myopathy is due, likely at least in part, to
decreased myocyte production of coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone). Serum muscle breakdown
markers (eg, creatine kinase) are often elevated, and severe cases may lead to
rhabdomyolysis with subsequent acute kidney injury (eg, elevated BUN and creatinine).

Statin myopathy is most common in the initial weeks or months of therapy. However, it can
occasionally occur later, and can be acutely triggered by medications that increase circulating
statin levels. This patient's myopathy is most likely related to the initiation of clarithromycin as
part of a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori.

Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by CYP3A4. This
enzyme can be inhibited by macrolide antibiotics (eg, erythromycin, clarithromycin), leading
to increased statin drug levels and subsequent statin myopathy. (Azithromycin does not
significantly inhibit CYP3A4.) Other significant CYP3A4 inhibitors that can induce statin
myopathy include ketoconazole, non—dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg, diltiazem),
amiodarone, and protease inhibitors (eg, ritonavir). Because pravastatin is not primarily
metabolized by CYP3A4, patients who must take a CYP3A4 inhibitor may benefit from
