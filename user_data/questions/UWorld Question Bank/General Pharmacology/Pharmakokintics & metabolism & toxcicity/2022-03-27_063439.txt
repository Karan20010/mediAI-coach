Perception of motion and orientation is determined by input from the vestibular, visual, and
somatosensory systems. These 3 systems are usually congruent, but conflicting input can

lead to motion sickness, characterized by nausea, dizziness, and autonomic symptoms (eg,
diaphoresis). Integration of these sensory pathways occurs in the vestibular nuclei via

muscarinic and histaminic neurotransmission. As such, antimuscarinic agents (eg,

scopolamine) and first-generation antihistamines (eg, meclizine, dimenhydrinate) are most
effective for management of motion sickness. Anticholinergic side effects are common with

these medications and may include blurry vision, dry mouth, urinary retention, and

constipation.

(Choices A, D, and E) Cough, frequent urination, and nasal congestion are characteristic of
stimulation rather than blockade of muscarinic pathways.

(Choice B) Diarrhea may be seen with dopamine receptor antagonists (eg, metoclopramide),
but these drugs are primarily used for visceral (eg, diabetic gastroparesis), rather than
vestibular, nausea.

Educational objective:
Antimuscarinic agents and antihistamines with antimuscarinic action are most effective for
motion sickness prevention.
