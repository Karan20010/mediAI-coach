unchanged by the kidney.

(Choice C) Decreased tissue perfusion in heart failure typically leads to a reduced volume of
distribution of most drugs. Although the extracellular fluid accumulation that occurs in
decompensated heart failure can potentially increase the volume of distribution of water-
soluble drugs, this increased distribution volume would result in a decrease in serum drug
levels.

(Choice E) Increased central venous pressure in heart failure can lead to intestinal wall
edema with increased intestinal wall thickness. This can result in delayed or decreased
intestinal drug absorption. However, this effect would be expected to cause reduced serum
drug concentrations and delayed peak levels.

Educational objective:

Heart failure leads to reduced liver and kidney perfusion, resulting in reduced drug clearance.
Metformin is excreted unchanged by the kidney; therefore, patients with significant renal
insufficiency due to heart failure or other causes (eg, chronic kidney disease) are at increased
risk of toxicity (eg, lactic acidosis).
