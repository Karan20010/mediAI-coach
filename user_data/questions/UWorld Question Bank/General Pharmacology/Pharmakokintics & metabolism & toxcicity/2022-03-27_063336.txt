Morphine stimulates mu opioid receptors to provide the desired effect of analgesia, but in
doing so can also precipitate many undesired effects. This patient has multiple signs of opioid
toxicity, including miosis (ie, pinpoint pupils), respiratory depression (evidenced by slow
respiratory rate and respiratory acidosis), and CNS depression (eg, somnolence, coma).
Morphine is primarily metabolized by the liver via glucuronidation to form 2 major
metabolites. These metabolites, morphine-3-glucoronide and morphine-6-glucoronide, then
undergo renal elimination via excretion in the urine. Because the metabolites are
metabolically active, renal dysfunction can lead to metabolite accumulation and opioid
toxicity. Morphine-6-glucoronide is particularly responsible for toxicity, acting as a more potent
mu opioid receptor agonist than morphine itself.

Due to its metabolically active and renally cleared metabolites, morphine requires careful
monitoring when used in patients with renal dysfunction. When opioid pain control is needed
in such patients, fentanyl or hydromorphone is often preferred as these drugs are
predominantly hepatically cleared.

(Choice A) Decreased first-pass metabolism occurs with drugs that are given by a route other
than orally, allowing the drug to reach the systemic circulation without passing through the
portal circulation and the liver. Examples include drugs that are administered sublingually,
