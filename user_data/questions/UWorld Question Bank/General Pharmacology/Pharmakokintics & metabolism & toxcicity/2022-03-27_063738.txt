The kidney is the primary site of excretion of most drugs, with or without prior chemical
modification in the liver. The liver is the major site of drug biotransformation and metabolism,

ed by the liver into the bile and feces. Drugs

with high intrinsic hepatic clearance tend to have high lipophilicity and a high volume of
distribution. Highly lipophilic drugs tend to be poorly eliminated in the kidney as these agents

ion to reenter the tissues.

High lipophilicity (lipid solubility) allows the drug to cross cellular barriers more easily and enter
hepatocytes. It can then be excreted in the bile or through other methods of elimination. In

(Choice A) Drugs with a low distribution volume tend to be confined to the bloodstream and
tend not to diffuse readily through hepatocytes into the bile. Thus, a drug with a low V, will be
highly plasma protein-bound and hydrophilic, making it less available for hepatic metabolism
and more readily available for excretion unchanged in the urine.

(Choice B) A drug that is not well absorbed orally may have a high pre-systemic (first-pass)
elimination or be poorly lipid-soluble. In both cases, it will be unavailable to the liver for
