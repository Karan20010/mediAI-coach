This young patient with acne had a good initial response to tetracycline (eg, doxycycline)
therapy. However, after the initiation of new medications, she experienced a significant loss of
effectiveness, suggesting a possible drug-drug interaction. In this case, it is likely that the
new iron supplement is interacting with tetracycline to cause decreased absorption of the
antibiotic.

Tetracyclines interact with polyvalent cations to form nonabsorbable chelate complexes
in the gastrointestinal tract. This effect is prominently seen with iron and is also common with
other polyvalent metals (eg, aluminum, calcium, magnesium) found in widely used over-the-
counter preparations (eg, antacids). Other drugs susceptible to chelation include
fluoroquinolones and thyroxine.

The extent of chelation is influenced by gastric pH; the introduction of medications that raise
gastric pH (eg, H2-blockers [eg, famotidine], proton pump inhibitors [eg, omeprazole]) can
sometimes lead to increased chelation and loss of drug effect. Chelation can often be avoided
by taking the medications at different times of the day.

(Choice A) Combination oral contraceptives suppress androgenic activity and reduce
production of sebum. This typically leads to improvement, rather than worsening, of acne.
