This patient who recently received systemic chemotherapy for breast cancer and now has
progressive hematuria and suprapubic tenderness most likely has hemorrhagic cystitis
caused by a nitrogen mustard-based chemotherapeutic agent, such as cyclophosphamide or
one of its analogs (eg, ifosfamide). These agents are metabolized by the kidneys into
acrolein, which is then excreted in the urine. Acrolein is toxic to uroepithelial cells and can
cause cell death and necrosis if allowed to be in contact with these cells for a prolonged
period.

Hemorrhagic cystitis associated with nitrogen mustard-based chemotherapy can be prevented
by aggressive hydration and the coadministration of mesna (2-mercaptoethanesulfonate), a
sulfhydryl compound that binds and inactivates the toxic metabolites of the chemotherapeutic
agents in the urine.

(Choice A) Dexrazoxane is an iron-chelating agent that can help prevent anthracycline-
induced (eg, doxorubicin) cardiotoxicity.

(Choice B) Filgrastim is a granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) analog used to
stimulate the proliferation and differentiation of granulocytes | in patients with mete} as
