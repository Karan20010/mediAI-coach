Explanation

During continuous infusion of a drug metabolized by first-order kinetics (i.e. a constant fraction
of the drug is eliminated per unit time), the steady state concentration is reached in 4 to 5 half-
lives. Thus, it would take approximately 40 hours, or four times the half-life of 10 hours, for the
drug in question to reach approximately 95% steady-state concentration.

Educational objective:
During continuous infusion of a drug metabolized by first-order kinetics, the steady state
concentration is reached in 4 to 5 half-lives.
