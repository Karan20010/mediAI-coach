Educational objective:

Following intravenous administration, a highly lipophilic drug will be rapidly distributed to
organs with high blood flow (eg, brain, liver, kidneys, lungs). The drug is then redistributed to
tissues with relatively lower blood flow (eg, skeletal muscle, fat, bone). This accounts for the
short duration of action of many commonly used anesthetics, such as propofol.
