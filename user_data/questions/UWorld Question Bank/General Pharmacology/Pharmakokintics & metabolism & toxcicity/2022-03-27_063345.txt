(Choice B) Decreased hepatic metabolism is common in the elderly or in patients with
advanced liver disease (eg, cirrhosis). Although this patient has metastatic disease to the liver,
accumulation of morphine metabolites is a more likely cause of toxicity in the setting of known
renal failure.

(Choice C) Enterohepatic circulation occurs when a drug undergoes biliary excretion into the
small intestine, where it is then reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. Such drugs typically
demonstrate a prolonged half-life. Although the phenomenon may account for a prolonged
duration of therapeutic effect, it rarely accounts for toxicity.

(Choice E) Drugs with a high volume of distribution (eg, amiodarone) are well distributed in
the tissues and have a long half-life. These drugs may demonstrate prolonged therapeutic
and/or adverse effects after discontinuation.

Educational objective:

Morphine generates 2 major metabolites that are metabolically active and renally cleared.
These metabolites can accumulate in the bloodstream of patients with renal dysfunction and
lead to opioid toxicity, evidenced by miosis, respiratory depression, and CNS depression.
