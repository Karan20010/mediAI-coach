hepatic clearance.

(Choice D) A low rate of redistribution from one compartment to another implies low lipid
solubility or significant hydrophilicity. These drugs tend to remain in the intravascular
compartment and be eliminated by the kidneys.

(Choice E) Poor central nervous system penetration indicates that a drug is likely not
lipophilic, and therefore has a low volume of distribution. It is therefore also unlikely that the
same drug will be eliminated in large amounts by the liver.

Educational Objective:

While the kidney is the primary site of elimination of most drugs, the liver is the main site of
biotransformation of these agents in preparation for elimination. Drugs that are more lipophilic
(high V,, good penetration into CNS) are preferentially processed by the liver into more polar
compounds for easier elimination in the bile and urine. Liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis) or the
concomitant use of other drugs may limit or enhance the clearance of drugs metabolized in the

liver.
