volume) can increase the risk of CNS toxicity.

(Choice A) The liver is not fully developed in neonates and has decreased expression of
drug-metabolizing enzymes (eg, cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, glucuronidation enzymes).
This can lead to decreased clearance of drugs that are hepatically metabolized (eg,
acetaminophen, morphine). However, this would result in increased (not decreased) plasma
drug levels.

(Choice B) Renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate are decreased in neonates
compared to adults. For drugs that are renally excreted, reduced renal clearance would cause
increased serum drug concentrations, potentially leading to toxicity. However, in this study the
serum concentration is lower in neonates than in adults.

(Choice C) Neonates have decreased (not increased) plasma protein concentrations
compared to adults, which can increase free levels of highly protein-bound drugs (eg,
phenytoin, penicillin). Elevated bilirubin levels in neonates can further increase the
concentration of unbound drug by displacing them from albumin binding sites.

Educational objective:
Neonates have a higher proportion of body water compared to adults. This can result in lower

plasma concentrations of water-soluble drugs if they are administered at the same weight-
