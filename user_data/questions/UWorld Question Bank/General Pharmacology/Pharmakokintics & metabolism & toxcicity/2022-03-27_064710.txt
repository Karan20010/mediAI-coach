This patient, with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and sudden-onset neurologic deficits
(eg, right arm weakness, difficulty speaking) that fully resolved within minutes, most likely had
a transient ischemic attack (TIA). In addition to optimal blood pressure control and statin
therapy, low-dose aspirin is commonly used to prevent ischemic stroke in patients with
TIA. It works by irreversibly acetylating/inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. At low
doses, aspirin predominantly inhibits COX-1, preventing platelet synthesis of thromboxane
A2, which impairs platelet aggregation and reduces vasoconstriction.

At least 2 distinct COX-1-dependent mechanisms contribute to the increased risk of upper
gastrointestinal (Gl) bleeding associated with aspirin therapy: Inhibition of platelet
aggregation and impairment of prostaglandin-dependent GI mucosal protection. The risk of
upper GI bleeding increases with higher doses but is increased 2- to 3-fold even with low-dose
aspirin. Proton pump inhibitors can help reduce the risk of upper GI bleeding in patients taking
aspirin.

(Choice A) Central nervous system depression is commonly seen with benzodiazepine use
as these agents potentiate the effect of GABA (a major inhibitory neurotransmitter) on GABA-A
receptors.

(Choice C) Very high doses of aspirin can cause salicylism (eg, vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss)
