(Choice A) Amoxicillin does not inhibit CYP3A4 or increase circulating simvastatin levels.
Penicillin antibiotics generally have only minor effects on the cytochrome P-450 system.

(Choice B) Bismuth subsalicylate can cause black stools due to the formation of bismuth
sulfate in the gastrointestinal tract. However, this medication does not cause myopathy or
myoglobinuria. Excessive intake of bismuth can cause motor weakness, but this is due
primarily to neural rather than muscle toxicity.

(Choice C) Polyvalent cations (eg, calcium, iron) can form insoluble chelate complexes with
certain antibiotics (eg, tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones) and other drugs (eg, levothyroxine,
levodopa), leading to decreased drug absorption. Simvastatin does not form chelate
complexes, and decreased absorption would lower, not increase, the risk for myopathy.

(Choice E) Both metronidazole and simvastatin carry a small risk for peripheral neuropathy.
In some patients, the effect can be additive and lead to numbness, pain, and paresthesia in
the hands and feet. However, this neuropathy would not cause muscle tenderness or
myoglobinuria.

Educational objective:

Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by CYP3A4. Drugs
