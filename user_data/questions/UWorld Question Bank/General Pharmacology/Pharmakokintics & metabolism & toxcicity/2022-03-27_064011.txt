Educational objective:

Statins, primarily simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin, are metabolized by CYP3A4. Drugs
that inhibit this enzyme (eg, macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, nonâ€”dihydropyridine calcium
channel blockers, amiodarone) can cause increased statin drug levels and lead to statin

myopathy.
