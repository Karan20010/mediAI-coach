This patient who took large quantities of a pain medication initially had nausea and vomiting
and has now developed scleral icterus, right upper quadrant pain, and markedly elevated
aminotransferases. These findings are consistent with an overdose of acetaminophen, a
commonly used analgesic.

When taken at appropriate doses, acetaminophen produces small amounts of the toxic
metabolite N-acety|-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI]), which is conjugated with glutathione in
the liver and excreted. At supratherapeutic doses, glutathione becomes saturated, allowing
excessive amounts of NAPQI to form adducts with hepatic proteins that disrupt hepatocyte
mitochondrial function and cause oxidative injury.

Because acetaminophen-induced liver injury primarily affects hepatocytes (ie, hepatocellular
liver injury), laboratory findings show markedly elevated aminotransferases with levels
sometimes >1,000 U/L. Mild elevations of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase can be seen but
may be normal. Liver biopsy shows centrilobular hepatic necrosis, a common finding in

ischemic or toxic liver injury.

(Choice A) Certain drugs (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin) can trigger a robust CD4- and CD8-

T-cell response against hepatic proteins, leading to drug reaction with eosinophilia and
systemic symptoms (DRESS). Although hepatocellular liver injury can occur, fever,
