dose dependent and is not an indicator of drug bioavailability.

(Choice D) PO administration of a drug usually results in lower peak serum drug levels
compared to IV administration, even when PO bioavailability is near 100%, due to delayed
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (versus near-instantaneous delivery of IV drugs). As
a result, comparing peak PO to peak IV concentration levels is not an appropriate way to
determine bioavailability.

Educational objective:

Bioavailability refers to the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation.
For a drug administered by any route other than intravenous (IV), bioavailability is usually less
than 100%. Bioavailability can be determined by graphing plasma drug concentrations over
time for a given dose administered by both the IV route and the other route being studied.
Oral (PO) bioavailability is calculated by dividing the area under the PO curve by the area
under the IV curve.
