Optimal antibiotic therapy often requires monitoring of serum drug concentrations to ensure

5 adequate dosing, which is necessary to achieve therapeutic levels while avoiding toxicity (eg,

: nephrotoxicity due to aminoglycosides). The highest level (peak) of drug concentration is

8 usually % hour after intravenous or 1 hour after intramuscular dosing, whereas the lowest drug

= concentration (trough) occurs during the last 2 hour before the next dose.

= The drug concentration (mg/L) can be calculated by dividing the drug dose (mg) by the

b volume of distribution (V,). V, refers to the theoretically required volume (in liters) if the drug

- were contained completely in the plasma. It can vary depending on how well the drug

distributes into tissues; the higher the V., the greater the drug binds to the tissues. When drug
18 metabolism occurs via first-order kinetics, the half-life (t,.) represents the amount of time

required to lower the drug concentration by 50%.

In this example, the first dose of the drug is 240 mg, V, is 30 L, and t,, is 4 hours. The initial
23 drug concentration is the dose (240 mg) divided by the V, (30 L), which equals 8 mg/L. After
25 the first half-life (4 hours), the drug concentration will decrease by half to 4 mg/L. After the
next half-life (4 hours later, or 8 hours after the initial dose), the drug concentration will

: 28 decrease by half again to 2 mg/L (Choices A, B, C, and E).
