The small intestine has greater blood flow than the colon due to the high rate of active
transport required for nutrient digestion and absorption.

(Choices C and D) For drugs administered orally, the majority of absorption occurs in the
small intestine due to its large surface area. In contrast, the surface area of the rectum is far
smaller than that of the small intestine. Therefore, absorption of rectally administered drugs is
typically slower and more unpredictable (due to variable amounts of stool) than that of orally
administered drugs. This often necessitates more frequent or greater volume dosing to
achieve similar blood concentrations in the absence of significant first-pass metabolism.

(Choice E) Changes in renal blood flow affect the glomerular filtration rate, which in turn

affects the elimination of renally cleared drugs. Patients with impaired renal function have
increased bioavailability of substances that are predominantly metabolized by the kidney;
these patients may require lower doses to prevent adverse effects.
