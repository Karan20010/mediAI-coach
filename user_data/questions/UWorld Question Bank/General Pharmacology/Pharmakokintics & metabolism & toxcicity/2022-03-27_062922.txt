Heart failure can cause changes in pharmacokinetic parameters that can alter drug
effectiveness and lead to increased toxicity. Decreased cardiac output leads to tissue
hypoperfusion, lowering the volume of distribution of many drugs and reducing perfusion of
organs responsible for drug clearance (eg, liver, kidneys). This can result in higher serum
drug levels and a prolonged elimination phase, which can be particularly important for drugs
with a narrow therapeutic index (eg, digoxin, antiarrhythmics).

In this example, serum metformin levels are seen to increase in animals with experimentally
induced heart failure. Because metformin is renally cleared, this effect is most likely due to
decreased renal blood flow as a result of reduced cardiac output. Because of the risk of
lactic acidosis, metformin should be used with caution in patients with heart failure or impaired
renal function from other causes.

(Choices A and D) Heart failure frequently causes high central venous pressure and hepatic
congestion. The resulting impairment in nutrient and oxygen delivery leads to hepatocellular
damage and downregulation of CYP enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Reduced hepatic
blood flow also results in decreased drug delivery to the liver, further impairing hepatic drug
metabolism and clearance. However, metformin is not metabolized by the liver; it is excreted
unchanged by the kidney.
