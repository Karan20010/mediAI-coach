=~ Question Id: 14919
This patient has esophagitis, with burning pain in the chest and dysphagia. Medication-
induced esophagitis is a common adverse effect of bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate,
risedronate) thought to be caused by disruption of the protective phospholipid barrier in the
lower esophagus. This allows refluxing gastric acid to cause mucosal erosion and ulceration.
Bisphosphonates are contraindicated in conditions that impair esophageal motility (eg,
stricture, achalasia). When bisphosphonates are used, the risk of esophagitis can be lessened
by taking the medication with a full glass of water (to ensure the pill is delivered fully into the
stomach) and remaining upright for 30 minutes following administration (to avoid reflux of
gastric contents).

Bisphosphonates are also associated with osteonecrosis of the jaw (mandible or maxilla)
and atypical bone fractures (eg, stress fractures of the subtrochanteric zone and femoral
shaft). The precise pathophysiology is debated and may vary, but proposed mechanisms
include suppression of bone remodeling, impaired healing of microfractures, and decreased
angiogenesis.

(Choice A) Medication-induced nephropathy can be due to interstitial nephritis (eg,
cyclosporine), crystal nephropathy (eg, acyclovir), renal vasoconstriction (eg, amphotericin B,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), or tubular injury (eg, aminoglycosides).
