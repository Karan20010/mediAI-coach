stimulate the chemoreceptor trigger zone, leading to emesis.

(Choice D) Respiratory depression is the most serious, yet rare, side effect of opioid therapy.
Opioids depress respiration by reducing responsiveness of brainstem respiratory centers to
increased levels of carbon dioxide. Patients who take opioids regularly are unlikely to develop
respiratory depression as tolerance to this side effect develops rapidly.

(Choice E) Sedation typically occurs during initiation of therapy and usually disappears after
several days. It is not unusual for patients to be drowsy and sleep more during the first days of
therapy.

(Choice F) Opioids block urinary voiding reflexes and also increase sphincter tone and
