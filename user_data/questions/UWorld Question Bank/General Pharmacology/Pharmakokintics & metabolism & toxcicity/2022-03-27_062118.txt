Atropine is an anticholinergic medication that can be administered prior to bronchoscopy to

decrease respiratory mucus secretions and promote bronchodilation. Anticholinergic drugs
competitively inhibit the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor both centrally (leading to delirium,
coma, and respiratory failure) and peripherally (see toxidrome in table). The elderly are at
particularly high risk of developing anticholinergic toxicity, likely due to decreased renal and
hepatic clearance.

Cholinesterase inhibitors overcome this toxicity by inhibiting the degradation of
acetylcholine, thereby increasing the concentration of acetylcholine at the synaptic cleft.
Central nervous system (CNS) penetration and reversal of central symptoms are dependent
on chemical structure:

¢ Tertiary amines (eg, physostigmine, galantamine, donepezil, rivastigmine) are lipophilic
(nonpolar) and can easily cross the blood-brain barrier to reverse both central and
peripheral symptoms.

¢ Quaternary amines (eg, neostigmine, edrophonium, pyridostigmine) are hydrophilic
(polarized) and do not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. These drugs reverse
peripheral symptoms only (Choices B and D).

(Choices A and C) Both diazepam and haloperidol can be used for sedation or cases of pelea
