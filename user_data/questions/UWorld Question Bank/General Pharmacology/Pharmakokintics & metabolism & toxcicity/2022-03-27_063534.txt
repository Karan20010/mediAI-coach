proportion that is converted to the metabolite becomes smaller (ie, the proportion metabolized
is non-constant after point 3).

(Choice B) Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic
circulation unchanged. It usually decreases with oral administration due to incomplete
absorption and first-pass metabolism compared to parenteral administration. In this case,
higher doses of the drug are likely to have greater bioavailability due to the saturation of
hepatic metabolism.

(Choice C) At point 2, biotransformation (ie, metabolism) of the drug begins to switch from
first-order to zero-order kinetics due to enzyme saturation. However, drug metabolism does
not stop.

(Choice E) Before point 1, drug metabolism proceeds via first-order kinetics. Therefore, the
drug metabolization rate increases as higher doses are administered.

Educational objective:

In first-order kinetics, a constant fraction (or proportion) of drug is metabolized per unit of time,
so the amount metabolized changes based on the serum concentration. In zero-order kinetics,
a constant amount of drug is metabolized per unit of time, independent of serum levels.
