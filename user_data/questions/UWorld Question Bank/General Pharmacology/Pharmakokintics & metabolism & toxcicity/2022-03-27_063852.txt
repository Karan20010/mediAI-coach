systemic symptoms (DRESS). Although hepatocellular liver injury can occur, fever,
lymphadenopathy, and skin manifestations (eg, facial edema, coalescing erythema) would be

expected.

(Choice B) Drug-mediated (eg, ceftriaxone) cholestatic liver injury typically causes biliary duct
damage or interrupts the flow of bile. These patients have markedly elevated levels of alkaline
phosphatase (and sometimes bilirubin), and aminotransferase levels are typically normal.

(Choice D) Microvesicular steatohepatitis, or small droplets of intracytoplasmic lipids within
hepatocytes, is caused by drugs that disrupt fatty acid beta-oxidation. Ibuprofen and aspirin
are commonly used analgesics that can rarely lead to this condition; however, marked
aminotransferase elevations are not seen in ibuprofen toxicity, and aspirin toxicity is usually
seen in young children with a recent viral infection (ie, Reye syndrome).

(Choice E) Chronic alcohol consumption can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which
activate stellate cells and cause cirrhosis. Although NAPQI does create ROS, stellate cell
activation does not occur, and this patient's acute liver injury after analgesic ingestion makes
this diagnosis unlikely.
