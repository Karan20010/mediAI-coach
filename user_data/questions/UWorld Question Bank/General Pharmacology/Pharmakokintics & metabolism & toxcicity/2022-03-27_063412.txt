gastrointestinal absorption of statins.

(Choice D) Fibrates can increase drug levels of ezetimibe but this does not have a significant
impact on its side effects, which are generally mild and not dose-related. Ezetimibe does not
alter the pharmacokinetics of fibrates and does not substantially influence their adverse
effects.

(Choices E and F) The primary adverse effects of niacin include flushing, hyperglycemia, and
hepatotoxicity. There are no significant interactions with the concurrent use of niacin and
ezetimibe or gemfibrozil.

Educational objective:
The primary side effects of statins include myopathy and hepatitis. Fibrates such as
gemfibrozil can impair hepatic clearance of statins, increasing the risk of severe myopathy.
