This patient has suffered a thromboembolic stroke, likely the result of a dislodged left atrial
thrombus that formed due to an adverse drug interaction leading to inadequate
anticoagulation. Many substances cause induction or inhibition of cytochrome P450
(CYP450) hepatic microsomal enzymes, which are responsible for the majority of drug
metabolism. CYP450 interactions should be considered when selecting and dosing
medications, as changes in enzyme activity affect the rate of drug metabolism.

Alterations in plasma drug levels are especially important when considering medications that
are vital to a patient's health or have a high propensity for toxicity, such as warfarin. For
example, warfarin can interact with St John's wort, an over-the-counter medicinal herb
known for both its anti-inflammatory and antidepressant properties. St John's wort induces
hepatic CYP450 enzymes, resulting in increased warfarin metabolism, decreased drug levels,
and inadequate anticoagulation.

(Choices A, B, C, D, and E) These drugs are known to inhibit CYP450 enzymes and increase
warfarin levels, leading to an increased risk of bleeding complications.
(Choice F) Oral penicillin V and warfarin do not have any significant interactions. Antibiotics

in general reduce the intestinal bacterial load, which reduces vitamin K synthesis and could
potentiate warfarin's anticoagulant effects.
