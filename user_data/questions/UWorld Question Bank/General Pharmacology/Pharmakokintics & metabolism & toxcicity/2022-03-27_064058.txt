Educational objective:

Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation
unchanged. Drugs administered orally enter the portal circulation and are subject to first-pass
metabolism. Rectal administration is capable of partially bypassing first-pass metabolism as a
proportion of rectal blood flow enters the systemic circulation directly. Drugs that undergo
extensive first-pass metabolism have increased bioavailability when administered rectally.
