same effect at each point along the curve. If enough of the original substrate is added, the
reaction can still reach the same maximum effect. Thus, the log dose-response curve for a full
agonist combined with a reversible competitive antagonist will exhibit a parallel shift to the right
in the log-dose response curve, with an increase in the ED. and no change in the maximum

effect (Emax).

(Choice A) Curve A is the dose-response curve for the original agonist drug in the absence of
modifiers such as antagonists.

(Choices B and C) Both Curves B and C represent the effect of adding a noncompetitive
antagonist to the agonist. Note that the EDso is unchanged (i.e. the EDso for Curves A, B and C
occur at the exact same log drug concentration). This is a distinguishing characteristic of
noncompetitive antagonism. The maximum effect (E,.ax.) of Curves B and C are reduced
because the noncompetitive antagonist has effectively reduced the number of receptors
available for binding. The decrease in E,,., will depend on the dose of noncompetitive
antagonist present and is illustrated by the difference between Curves B and C, where a
higher concentration of antagonist is present in Curve C than in Curve B.

(Choice D) Curve D illustrates a rightward shift in the dose-response relationship, but the shift
