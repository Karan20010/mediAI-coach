This patient has Gaucher disease, an autosomal recessive condition caused by a deficiency
of lysosomal beta-glucocerebrosidase. This deficiency leads to the accumulation of
glucocerebroside, a glycolipid component of cell membranes, within the lysosomes of
macrophages, giving them the classic appearance of wrinkled tissue paper. Characteristic
symptoms (eg, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, bone pain) develop as lipid-laden
macrophages accumulate in the body's tissues (eg, spleen, liver, and bone).

Lysosomal storage diseases can be treated through the delivery of a replacement enzyme
into the lysosomes of affected cells; in the case of Gaucher disease, recombinant
glucocerebrosidases (eg, imiglucerase) are available to replace the deficient enzyme.
Almost all human enzymes, including lysosomal enzymes, are large polypeptides (eg,
proteins) (Choice B). Although the oral route is often preferred for drug administration, most
peptide-based drugs (eg, insulin, immunoglobulins) cannot be efficiently absorbed by the
gastrointestinal tract due to the intestinal epithelial barrier and extensive proteolysis that takes
place in the stomach and duodenum. As a result, large polypeptides such as a
glucocerebrosidase must be administered intravenously to achieve adequate circulating
levels.

Once in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to mannose
