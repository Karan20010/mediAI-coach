Question Id: 1707
Efficacy and potency are terms that are commonly used and often confused. In pharmacology,
efficacy refers to the intrinsic ability of a drug to elicit an effect, such as receptor activation or
dilation of a vessel as described in the question stem. It is a measure of the maximum ceiling
of activity [E,..] of a drug with respect to a particular pharmacodynamic end point. For
example, loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide will cause greater diuresis or
natriuresis than any thiazide diuretic, irrespective of dose.

Potency, on the other hand, refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given
effect. The potency of a drug is primarily affected by the affinity of the drug for its receptor and
the amount of drug that is able to reach the target tissues Therefore, drugs that bind their
receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will have
greater potency. The potency of different agents can be compared by determining the dose of
drug that is required to produce one-half (50%) of the maximum biological response. This
dose is known as the EDs. The lower the ED, of a drug, the more potent it is. For example,
among the thiazide diuretics, 25mg of hydrochlorothiazide and 5mg chlorthalidone produce
similar drops in blood pressure (similar efficacy), but chlorthalidone requires a lower dose, or
lower EDzo, than HCTZ to cause a similar effect (higher potency).

With respect to the question, drug 2 and drug 3 have similar maximum effects (efficacy). A
