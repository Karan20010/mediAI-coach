major cause of chemotherapy resistance. Efflux pump inhibitors can decrease drug excretion
from tumor cells and potentiate the effects of chemotherapeutic agents.

(Choice B) Many cancers create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that prevents the
immune system from effectively killing tumor cells. An enhanced cytotoxic T-cell response
against tumor cells occurs with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, PD-1 or CTLA-4
receptor inhibitors) that help prevent T-cell exhaustion.

(Choice C) Desmoplasia (ie, reactive growth of fibrous connective tissue) occurs in response
to certain tumors (eg, breast, pancreatic carcinoma). The dense fibrotic tissue acts as a
molecular sieve, decreasing the penetration of chemotherapeutic agents. Chemoresistance is
more likely to occur with larger drug complexes; in this case, the new liposomal formulation will
be much larger than individual cisplatin molecules, resulting in decreased desmoplastic
penetration.

(Choice D) Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) within tumors
stimulates blood vessel growth, facilitating tumor expansion and increasing the potential for
metastasis. Anti-VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) bind VEGF and inhibit tumor-induced
angiogenesis. Although EGFR stimulation also plays a role in angiogenesis, in this case, the
anti-EFGR antibodies are used for targeting purposes and may not necessary inhibit the
