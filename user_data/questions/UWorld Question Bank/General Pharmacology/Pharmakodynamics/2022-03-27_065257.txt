In both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired. Innate tolerance refers to inborn
differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or
receptor structure/expression (pharmacodynamic). Innate tolerance is apparent from the first
dose, which elicits an unexpectedly weak effect. This patient experienced a good analgesic

response initially, arguing against the presence of innate tolerance (Choice A).

Acquired tolerance is defined as a decreased pharmacologic response following prolonged
drug exposure. Acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance is the primary form of chronic opioid
tolerance, characterized by downregulation and decreased responsivity (eg, GRK/beta-arrestin
phosphorylation) of the mu opioid receptor system compared to the opioid-naive state.

(Choice C) The kappa and delta opioid receptors bind to endogenous opioid-like
neuropeptides (enkephalins and dynorphin, respectively) to mediate analgesia. Like mu
receptors, they are also downregulated by chronic opioid administration, contributing further to

acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance.

(Choice D) In acquired pharmacokinetic tolerance, altered ADME results in lower plasma drug
levels. Higher rates of metabolism (eg, P450 enzyme autoinduction) can accelerate the
inactivation/elimination of many medications (eg, methadone, carbamazepine). However,

lower rates of excretion (eg, renal or hepatic insufficiency) would raise the plasma drug
