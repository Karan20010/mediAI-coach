Toxoplasma gondii is a ubiquitous protozoan that rarely causes illness in healthy individuals
but can cause severe infection in immunocompromised patients or those with congenital
infection. Symptomatic congenital disease is often marked by intracranial calcification,
hydrocephalus, chorioretinitis, jaundice, and/or thrombocytopenia. Early treatment with
sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine reduces neurologic and retinal sequelae.

Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine work synergistically to inhibit protozoal DNA synthesis by

blocking 2 steps necessary for the formation of tetrahydrofolate (THF), a cofactor needed for

synthesis of purine nucleic acids. Sulfadiazine inhibits dihydropteroate synthase, a

microbial enzyme that generates dihydropteroate, which is converted to dihydrofolic acid.

Pyrimethamine inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme that converts dihydrofolic acid to

THF. Activate Windows
