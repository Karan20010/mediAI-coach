A clinical trial is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a novel formulation of cisplatin for
treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Study participants are randomly assigned to 2
different cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. Subjects in the control arm are
administered conventional cisplatin chemotherapy, whereas those in the experimental arm are
given a formulation of cisplatin encapsulated in liposomes coated with anti-epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies. Patients in the experimental group are found to have a
statistically significant decrease in residual tumor burden compared with those in the control
group. The incidence of adverse effects was also lower in the experimental group. Compared
to conventional cisplatin chemotherapy, the new formulation is most likely to have which of the
following effects?

A. Decreased drug efflux from tumor cells (5%)

B. Enhanced cytotoxic T-cell response (5%)

C. Increased penetration through dense desmoplasia (9%)
D. Inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (31%)

YE. Selective drug uptake by cancer cells (48%)
