much lower dose of drug 2 is required to produce the same effect as that seen with drug 3;
therefore, drug 2 is more potent than drug 3 and has a lower EDs. To achieve this higher
potency, the binding of drug 2 to its receptors (affinity) must be higher than that of drug 3
(Choice B), or drug 2 must be better able to reach its target (penetration) than drug 3.
(Choice A) Drug 1 has higher potency than Drug 2 because at low biological activity, it can
cause the same effect with much lower concentrations of drug. However, it does not reach the
same maximum effect as Drug 2.

(Choice C) Drug 1 demonstrates the lowest efficacy (ceiling of biological effect) of the three
drugs graphed. Lower efficacy may be a result of partial agonism and other factors.

(Choice D) Drugs 2 and 3 exhibit a parallel shift in their relative biological effects exhibiting
similar efficacy but different potency (The shapes of their graphs are identical, but at different
dose ranges). Drug 3 may contain the same basic pharmocologic agent as Drug 2 but with a
competitive antagonist mixed in; thus, the E,,.. is the same but the ED is higher. A

competitive antagonist would bind to the same location as the original substance.
(Choice E) Drug 2 has a lower ED.» (greater potency) than drug 3. Both have equal efficacy.
