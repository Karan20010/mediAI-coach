bioavailability by pumping the drug back into the intestinal lumen. However, inhibition of p-
glycoprotein can have a variable effect on serum drug levels, as increased bioavailability is
often countered by increased drug distribution (eg, into the CSF or intracellular compartments).

(Choices A, B, and E) Reduced drug metabolism or decreased excretion could potentially
improve drug efficacy by increasing average serum drug levels. However, in this experiment,
serum drug levels increased by only 10 ng/ml (~2%) with coadministration of the adjuvant.
This minimal increase in drug concentration is not representative of a significant change in
drug metabolic/clearance parameters and is unlikely to lead to increased BBB penetration.

(Choice C) The choroid plexus is the site of CSF production and can function as an alternate
entryway into the CNS. However, the excretion of a substance by the choroid plexus is directly
dependent on choroidal blood flow; diminished blood flow would reduce the excretion of a
particular substance into the CSF.

Educational objective:

P-glycoprotein is an efflux pump found on brain capillary endothelial cells (part of the blood-
brain barrier) that inhibits a wide range of substrates from entering the brain. Inhibition of p-
glycoprotein can improve drug delivery to the CNS.
