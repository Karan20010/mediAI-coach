(Choice D) Probenecid blocks the renal tubular excretion of most beta-lactam antibiotics,
which can increase their serum level. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine are not used together
to alter renal excretion.

Educational objective:

Congenital toxoplasmosis is treated with sulfadiazine plus pyrimethamine. These medications
work synergistically to inhibit formation of tetrahydrofolate, a necessary cofactor for purine
nucleotide synthesis.
