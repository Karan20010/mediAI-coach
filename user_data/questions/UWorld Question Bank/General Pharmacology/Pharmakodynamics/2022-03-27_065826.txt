symptoms.
(Choice A) Accelerated drug metabolism can lead to tolerance when a substance induces the
enzymes responsible for its degradation (ie, cytochromes P450). This mechanism is
responsible for the tolerance seen with ethanol and barbiturates.
(Choice B) Decreased receptor affinity due to intracellular domain modification (eg,

phosphorylation) can play a role in receptor desensitization. However, desensitization of
adrenergic receptors is better explained by the decoupling of G proteins (which are blocked by
arrestins) and subsequent receptor internalization.

(Choice C) Tolerance to adrenergic agonists develops due to the binding of arrestins to
stimulated adrenergic receptors, preventing G proteins from interacting with the receptor. G
proteins themselves do not become depleted during this process.

(Choice E) Parasympathetic stimulation of the nasal mucosa causes vasodilation, increases
plasma extravasation, and stimulates glandular mucous secretion. Patients with rhinitis
medicamentosa have increased parasympathetic tone (physiologic antagonism) that

contributes to the congestion/rhinorrhea.
