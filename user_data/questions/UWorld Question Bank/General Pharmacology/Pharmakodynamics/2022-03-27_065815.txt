This patient has rhinitis medicamentosa due to the use of a nasal decongestant spray
containing an alpha-adrenergic agonist (eg, oxymetazoline). Intranasal application of alpha
agonists induces vasoconstriction of superficial blood vessels in the nasal mucosa, reducing
rhinorrhea and congestion. Although these agents are highly effective for symptom control,
use for more than a few days is associated with rebound rhinitis and dosage escalation due
to tachyphylaxis.

Tolerance to alpha-adrenergic decongestants develops quickly due to receptor
internalization. Both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors undergo a conformational change
on ligand binding, allowing them to activate heterotrimeric G proteins involved in signal
transduction. However, the change in conformation also results in the binding of arrestin, a
protein that prevents further G protein activation and links the receptor complex to clathrin,
facilitating receptor endocytosis and depletion from the cell surface.

As alpha-adrenergic receptors become increasingly scarce along the blood vessels of the
nasal mucosa, the release of endogenous catecholamines is no longer sufficient to provide
adequate vasoconstrictive stimulation. The resulting congestion/rhinorrhea can be relieved
only with increasing doses of exogenous alpha agonists. Treatment involves cessation of
the culprit decongestant, sometimes with use of intranasal corticosteroids to relieve severe
