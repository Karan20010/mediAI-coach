Platinum-based chemotherapy agents (eg, cisplatin) are widely used as a first-line treatment
for many solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer. These agents disrupt DNA
replication and have substantial cytotoxicity against rapidly proliferating cells. Despite their
efficacy in killing tumor cells, their use is limited by severe adverse effects (eg, nephrotoxicity,
ototoxicity, myelosuppression) that occur due to accumulation within normal tissues (ie, off-
target effects).

Methods that provide targeted delivery to the tumor site can help minimize toxicity and
optimize drug response. In this example, cisplatin is encapsulated in liposomes, forming a
nanoparticle cage that traps the drug and limits its interaction with normal cells. The addition
of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) antibodies on the liposome surface
results in an antibody-drug conjugate, allowing the encapsulated drug complex to
selectively bind to tumor cells expressing high levels of EGFR, which is often
overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer. Once bound, the antibody-drug complex is
internalized and degraded, releasing the free drug into the cytoplasm and causing targeted cell

death.

(Choice A) Overexpression of drug efflux pumps (eg, P-glycoprotein) by cancer cells is a

major cause of chemotherapy resistance. Efflux pump inhibitors can decrease drug excretion
