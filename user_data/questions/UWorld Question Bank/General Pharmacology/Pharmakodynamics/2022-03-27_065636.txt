hypotension in elderly patients, thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide), calcium channel
blockers (eg, amlodipine), and ACE inhibitors/angiotensin Il receptor blockers are generally

(Choice B) Aspirin should be used with caution in older adults due to the increased risk of
gastric ulcer; however, the reduced risk of cardiovascular events provided by aspirin in patients
with prior transient ischemic attack or stroke likely outweighs this risk.

(Choice D) Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor that is commonly used in the treatment of
Alzheimer dementia. Bradycardia can occasionally occur; however, this patient has a normal
heart rate.

(Choice F) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (eg, sertraline) are the preferred first-line
medications for depression in older adults. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg,
duloxetine) may also be used, especially for patients with chronic pain. Tricyclic

Educational objective:
