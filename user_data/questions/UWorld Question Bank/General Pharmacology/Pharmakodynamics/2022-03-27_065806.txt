Example mechanisms of tachyphylaxis

Adrenergic agonists Receptor inactivation & internalization by arrestins

Indirect sympathomimetics |Depletion of catecholamines from nerve terminals

. Depletion of reduced thiols decreases mtALDH activity &
Nitrates
NO production

Desmopressin (vWD) Depletion of vWF from endothelial storage sites

Barbiturates Induction of CYP450 enzymes

CYP450 = cytochrome P450; mtALDH = mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase; NO = nitric
oxide; VWD = von Willebrand disease; VWF = von Willebrand factor.
