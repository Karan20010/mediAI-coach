available for binding. The decrease in E,,., will depend on the dose of noncompetitive
antagonist present and is illustrated by the difference between Curves B and C, where a
higher concentration of antagonist is present in Curve C than in Curve B.

(Choice D) Curve D illustrates a rightward shift in the dose-response relationship, but the shift
is not a parallel shift because the shape of the curve differs from that of Curve A, with changes
in both Ex, and EDs. This curve is not characteristic of any single antagonist effect and may

be the result of adding multiple types of antagonists.

Educational Objective:

The changes in the log dose-response curve expected for the effect of a reversible competitive
antagonist added to a full agonist are: 1) a parallel shift to the right in the log-dose response
curve, illustrating an increase in the ED,., and 2) no change in the maximum effect (Emax)-

* Competitive=change ED.=shift right; noncompetitive=change E,,,=shift down.
