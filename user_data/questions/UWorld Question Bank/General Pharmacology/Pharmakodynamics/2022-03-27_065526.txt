adverse effects of the drug.

(Choice B) An idiosyncratic drug reaction is an unpredictable reaction due to genetic
differences or complex metabolic interactions in certain patients. The use of trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency can

lead to oxidative cellular injury and nonimmune hemolytic anemia.

(Choice C) Immunologic drug reactions (drug allergies) are unpredictable antibody or T cell-
mediated responses to medications. This patient's history of rash and pruritus with penicillin
likely represents IgE-mediated type | hypersensitivity.

(Choice E) Pseudoallergic drug reactions mimic immunologic reactions but occur via a
nonimmunologic mechanism (eg, direct immune cell activation, inhibited prostaglandin
synthesis). Vancomycin, opiates, and radioiodine contrast can directly activate mast cells to
cause a pseudoallergic reaction that closely mimics IgE-mediated type | hypersensitivity.

Educational objective:

Most adverse drug reactions are predictable and due to known pharmacologic properties of
the drug. Unpredictable reactions are less common and are typically driven by patient-specific
genetics (eg, enzyme deficiency, immunologic idiosyncrasy).
