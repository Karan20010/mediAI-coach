(Choice E) A decrease in plasma protein binding could lower the apparent volume of
distribution of a fixed dose of cyclosporine, thereby increasing the amount of free drug in
circulation. However, grapefruit juice does not influence the binding of cyclosporine to plasma
proteins.

Educational objective:

Calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity with resultant impairment of renal function is the most
significant adverse effect of cyclosporine. Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) is responsible for
cyclosporine metabolism in the small intestine and liver. Grapefruit juice inhibits this enzyme
and increases the nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine by raising circulating drug levels
(pharmacokinetic interaction).
