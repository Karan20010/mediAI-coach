Once in the circulation, exogenous glucocerebrosidase can enter cells by binding to mannose
6-phosphate receptors. These receptors are found in the Golgi network, where they help
route newly synthesized lysosomal proteins (tagged by mannose 6-phosphate residues). They
are also expressed on the cell surface, where they bind free lysosomal enzymes that are
accidentally secreted. Exogenous glucocerebrosidase can bind to these cell surface
receptors, inducing endocytosis of the bound enzyme. Itis then carried by endosomes to
lysosomes, where it can degrade accumulated glucocerebrosides, reducing disease

manifestations.

(Choices C and D) Enzymes are large, polar polypeptides that are unable to effectively cross
the cell membrane by passive diffusion. In contrast, steroid-based drugs are typically
hydrophobic and can easily cross cell membranes by passive diffusion. However, steroidal
drugs function by binding to receptors; they do not directly catalyze reactions.

(Choices E, F, G, and H) Unlike in lysosomal storage diseases, enzyme replacement therapy
for pancreatic exocrine insufficiency is administered orally because pancreatic digestive
enzymes normally function within the gastrointestinal lumen.

Educational objective:
Certain lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher disease, can be treated with enzyme-
