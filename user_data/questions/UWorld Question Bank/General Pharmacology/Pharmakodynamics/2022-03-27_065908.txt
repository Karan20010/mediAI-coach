Educational Objective:

Efficacy is a measure of the maximum pharmacodynamic effect achievable with a drug.
Potency refers to the dose of drug that is required to produce a given effect. Drugs that bind
their receptors with a higher affinity or are better able to gain access to their target tissues will
have greater potency (lower ED;)).
