(Choice B) Bone matrix comprises inorganic (eg, hydroxyapatite crystals) and organic (eg,
type 1 collagen) components. Osteoblasts release calcium-binding proteins (eg, osteocalcin)
and phosphatases that promote bone mineralization. Defective mineralization of bone matrix
is a characteristic feature of vitamin D deficiency.

(Choice D) Bone remodeling strengthens and repairs bone through the removal of old bone
by osteoclasts and replacement with new bone by osteoblasts. Impaired remodeling leads to
osteopetrosis (denser but more fragile bones). Pathologic fractures can occur, but blue
sclerae are not associated with this disorder.

(Choice E) Long bones have multiple arteries that are essential for growth and maintenance.
If the blood supply to the epiphysis is disrupted, the bone dies, resulting in avascular necrosis
(eg, Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease). Avascular necrosis typically presents with pain and limited
mobility but not pathologic fractures.

Educational objective:
Osteogenesis imperfecta results from defective synthesis of type 1 collagen by osteoblasts.
Clinical findings include a history of fractures after only minimal trauma, blue sclerae, and

small, malformed teeth. In most patients, osteogenesis imperfecta is transmitted by autosomal

dominant inheritance.
