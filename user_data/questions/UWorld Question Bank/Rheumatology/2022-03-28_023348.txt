sheaths, joint structures (eg, joint capsule), or bursae. Clear mucinous or gelatinous fluid
accumulates in the sac, giving rise to a round, well-circumscribed, firm cyst that
transilluminates on penlight examination. Ganglion cysts are most common on the dorsal
and volar wrists, but dorsal foot lesions are also common.

Most ganglion cysts resolve spontaneously and do not require specific treatment. Cysts that
raise cosmetic concerns or cause pain or paresthesia (due to nerve compression) can be
treated with needle aspiration if desired. However, recurrence is common, and patients may
eventually require surgical excision.

(Choice A) Bloodstream infection (bacteremia) can be a complication of cutaneous abscess,
which also presents as localized swelling. Unlike a ganglion cyst, an abscess is red, painful,
and fluctuant on palpation. Because of the collection of pus (an opaque liquid), an abscess
does not transilluminate.

(Choice B) Gouty tophi are hard, irregular, subcutaneous collections of uric acid crystals
found in patients with gout. Because of its solid nature, a gouty tophus does not
transilluminate.

(Choice C) This patient's ganglion cyst is causing compression of dorsal cutaneous nerves
