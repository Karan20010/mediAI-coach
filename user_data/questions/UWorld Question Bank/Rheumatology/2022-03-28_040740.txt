(Choice A) Analgesics and close follow-up are recommended for musculoskeletal causes of
low back pain, but this patient's clinical findings (fever, localized bony tenderness, recent
bacteremia) are concerning for more serious etiologies and require further evaluation.

(Choice B) CT myelogram, which can diagnose spinal stenosis or other vertebral pathology
(including osteomyelitis), is performed by injecting contrast into the lumbar spine prior to CT
imaging. However, it is more invasive than MRI and usually reserved for patients who cannot
undergo MRI (eg, those with pacemaker, metallic implants).

(Choice C) Lumbar puncture is typically used for diagnosing meningitis and has a low yield
for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis. CT-guided bone biopsy is usually preferred for isolating
the organism after imaging confirms the diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis.

(Choice E) Serum protein electrophoresis is typically done to evaluate for monoclonal
gammopathies (eg, multiple myeloma). Although multiple myeloma can present with back
pain, this patient's fever and recent bacteremia make vertebral osteomyelitis more likely.

Educational objective:
Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with new or worsening back pain,
fever, and recent endocarditis or bacteremia (especially Staphylococcus aureus). |t should
