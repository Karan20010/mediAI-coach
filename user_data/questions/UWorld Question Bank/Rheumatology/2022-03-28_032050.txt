¢ Spinal x-ray may show heterotopic ossification affecting the margins of the vertebral
bodies, which are visible as bridging syndesmophytes. Advanced and continuous
syndesmophyte formation is termed bamboo spine.

AS is a seronegative spondyloarthropathy, and there are no serologic tests to confirm the
diagnosis. Although most cases are associated with human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27),
most patients with HLA-B27 never develop AS, so this marker does not confirm the diagnosis.
Patients often have elevated inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-
reactive protein) and abnormal blood counts (eg, anemia, leukocytosis), but these findings are
nonspecific (Choices A and B).

(Choice C) Nerve conduction studies are typically used to identify peripherial nerve lesions in
patients with deficits on neurologic examination. This patient has normal examination findings,
so electrodiagnostics would have little utility.

(Choice D) Rheumatoid factor is used in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which
typically occurs in patients age >40 and is more common in women (AS is more common in
men). RA usually causes a symmetric peripheral arthritis; cervical involvement can occur, but
the lumbar spine is usually spared.
