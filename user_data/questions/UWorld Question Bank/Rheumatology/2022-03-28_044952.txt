This patient's biopsy is consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic vasculitis of
medium-sized muscular arteries. Patients with PAN typically present with weeks or months
of constitutional symptoms (eg, malaise, weight loss, myalgia, fever) and signs of tissue
ischemia in the kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and/or neurologic system. Bleeding
complications may occur due to the formation of microaneurysms from arterial wall
weakening. Biopsy of affected areas generally reveals segmental, transmural inflammation
with fibrinoid necrosis (amorphic, eosinophilic material in vessel wall) and disruption of the
internal and external elastic laminae.

In contrast to many other forms of vasculitis, PAN is not associated with antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies or significantly elevated antinuclear antibody titers. However,
inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are generally
high. Although many cases of PAN have no clear inciting factor, up to a third of patients have
underlying viral hepatitis B or C. In these individuals, PAN is likely triggered by the
deposition of immune complexes (viral antigen bound by host antibody) in the arterial wall.

(Choice A) Cutaneous small-vessel (leukocytoclastic) vasculitis is frequently triggered by
antibiotic use. This condition is also mediated by immune complexes and often causes
fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall. However, most cases are marked by palpable purpura
