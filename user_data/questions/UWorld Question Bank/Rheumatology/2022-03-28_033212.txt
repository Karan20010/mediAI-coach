typically presents as an asymmetric arthritis of the large joints. Common associated
symptoms include conjunctivitis, urethritis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum.

Reactive arthritis is most common following infections with Campylobacter, Shigella,
Salmonella, Yersinia, Chlamydia, or Bartonella. The clinical manifestations are caused by
immune complexes involving bacterial antigens. However, it does not represent
disseminated infection, and joint aspirates are sterile (ie, it is a 'reactive' not infectious
arthritis).

(Choice A) C1 inhibitor deficiency is associated with hereditary angioedema. C1 inhibitor

degrades C1 and prevents excessive complement activation and inflammation.

(Choice B) High titers of antistreptolysin O antibody are seen in nonpurulent complications of
group A streptococcal infections, such as rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis.

(Choices D and E) Antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor are nonspecific markers of
autoimmune disease, primarily systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis,
respectively. These conditions are less common in men, do not usually present with acute
monoarthritis, and are not associated with recent diarrheal illness.
