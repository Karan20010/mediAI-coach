(Choice D) The rectus femoris is 1 of 4 quadriceps muscles that attach to the patella via the
shared quadriceps tendon. It functions to extend the knee and flex the thigh. A patient with an
abscess involving this muscle would most likely complain of thigh or knee pain and favor
extension at the knee.

(Choice E) The transversus abdominis is the deepest of the 3 anterolaterally coursing
abdominal wall muscles. It helps maintain posture and increases intraabdominal pressure
during forced expiration and defecation.

Educational objective:

Psoas abscess presents with fever, back or flank pain, an inguinal mass, and difficulty
walking. Inflammation of the psoas muscle leads to pain with extension at the hip (ie, psoas
sign). Psoas abscess can develop due to hematogenous or lymphatic seeding from a distant
site, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, and
immunosuppression (eg, HIV infection).
