This child has acute-onset fever, malaise, and refusal to bear weight, findings concerning for
osteomyelitis. Older children often have focal bony tenderness, but children age <2 may be
unable to localize pain. Passive range of motion of the joints typically is normal and helps
distinguish osteomyelitis from septic arthritis.

The most common cause of osteomyelitis in children is hematogenous spread of bacteria,
which may be introduced by minor (often unnoticed) trauma to a distant site. Infection in
children classically occurs in the metaphyses of long bones (eg, femur, tibia) because this
region is highly vascular yet contains slow-flowing sinusoids that are conducive to bacterial
seeding. Bacterial seeding within the metaphysis initially causes acute inflammation of the
bone marrow, with focal hyperperfusion and increased radiotracer uptake within the affected
region.

Persistent inflammation within the confined bony space leads to increased intramedullary

pressure, which compromises blood flow and forces infectious exudate into the cortex and
periosteum. Without treatment, the infection can progress to chronic suppurative
osteomyelitis, in which necrotic bone (ie, sequestrum) serves as an infectious reservoir and
sinus tracts develop to drain away the purulent material.

Choice A) Osteomyelitis of flat bones (eg, skull, pelvis) is uncommon in children and is
