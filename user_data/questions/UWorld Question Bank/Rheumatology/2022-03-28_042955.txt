This patient has skin thickening in the digits consistent with systemic sclerosis (SS) (also
called scleroderma), an autoimmune disease characterized by widespread fibrosis in multiple
organ systems. The pathogenesis of SS primarily involves an interplay between immunologic
and vascular processes that ultimately results in excess fibrosis and vasculopathy. The main
cells involved are endothelial cells, T lymphocytes, and fibroblasts:

¢ Vascular endothelial cells produce excessive endothelin 1, which causes
vasoconstriction and activation of underlying fibroblasts. They also increase expression of
adhesion molecules, which facilitates binding and extravasation of circulating
lymphocytes.

¢ T lymphocytes migrate into the tissues and increase expression of numerous cytokines
that further activate tissue fibroblasts.

¢ Dermal fibroblasts produce increasing quantities of collagen and ground substance,
leading to thickening and stiffening of the tissue.
The skin in SS undergoes dermal expansion due to diffuse deposition of collagen (eosinophilic

connective tissue), resulting in atrophy of the intradermal adipose tissue and obliteration of
dermal appendages (eq, hair follicles, glands). Early symptoms often include finger swelling
