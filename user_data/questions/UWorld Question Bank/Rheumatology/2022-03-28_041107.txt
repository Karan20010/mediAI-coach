RANK-L to RANK does not affect osteoblast activity or bone mineralization.

(Choice E) Osteocytes are derived from osteoblasts. Osteocyte survival is regulated by a
variety of factors including mechanical stress, local growth factors, and steroid hormone
levels. Although osteocytes produce RANK-L, which acts on osteoclasts, osteocyte survival is
not dependent on the RANK signaling pathway.

Educational objective:

The nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK-ligand (RANK-L) interaction is essential for the
formation and differentiation of osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) blocks binding of RANK-L
to RANK and reduces formation of mature osteoclasts, leading to decreased bone resorption.
Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis
that works in a manner similar to OPG.
