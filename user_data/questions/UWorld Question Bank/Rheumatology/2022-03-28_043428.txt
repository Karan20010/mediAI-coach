Educational objective:

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is most often caused by compression of the brachial plexus
as it passes through the scalene triangle, the space bordered by the anterior and middle
scalene muscles and the first rib. Symptoms typically include upper extremity numbness,
tingling, and weakness that worsen with repetitive overhead arm movements. The presence of
an anomalous cervical rib is a risk factor for TOS.
