Interaction between the receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) and its ligand
(RANK-L), is critical for the development of mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. This binding
is blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor for RANK-L
(preventing it from interacting with RANK). By binding RANK-L, OPG reduces the
differentiation and survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption and
increased bone density.

Estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women by inducing production of OPG by
osteoblasts and stromal cells and decreasing expression of RANK on osteoclast precursors.
The loss of OPG at menopause leads to increased osteoclast activity that predisposes to
osteoporosis.

Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
It works similar to OPG in that it binds RANK-L and prevents its interaction with RANK
receptor. Denosumab therefore causes decreased osteoclast differentiation and activity
(Choice D) as well as decreased bone resorption.

(Choices A and C) RANK (receptor) is not present on osteoblasts, and inhibition of binding of
RANK-L to RANK does not affect osteoblast activity or bone mineralization.
