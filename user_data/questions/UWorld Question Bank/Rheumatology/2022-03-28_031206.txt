This patient, an older woman with use-dependent joint pain, has typical features of
osteoarthritis (OA). Patients with OA of the hands may also have osteophyte formation
leading to bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints (Heberden and Bouchard nodes, respectively). OA also
commonly involves the spine and the large weight-bearing joints of the lower extremities
(knees, hips). Morning stiffness is more typical of the inflammatory arthritides such as
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but may be experienced for a short duration (<30 minutes) in
patients with OA as well.

In contrast, morning stiffness in RA may persist for hours and is often accompanied by
systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss). RA typically causes symmetric arthritis of the
metacarpophalangeal, PIP, and other joints, but DIP joint involvement is less common (Choice
F). In contrast to the bony enlargement in OA, the involved joints in RA have active synovitis,
with warmth and spongy swelling.

(Choice A) Fibromyalgia is characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal pain that worsens with
weather changes, psychological stress, or reduced sleep. It does not cause joint deformities.

(Choice B) Gout causes acute, episodic inflammatory monoarthritis that is characterized by a
red, swollen, and painful joint. It usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint, knees, or
