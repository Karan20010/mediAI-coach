(Choice A) The coracobrachialis originates from the coracoid process of the scapula and acts
to flex the arm at the glenohumeral joint. The musculocutaneous nerve pierces the muscle
near its insertion into the humerus; overuse of the coracobrachialis (eg, excessive bench
pressing) can cause entrapment of the musculocutaneous nerve, causing impaired elbow
flexion and lateral forearm sensory loss.

(Choice C) The subscapularis muscle originates in the subscapular fossa of the scapula and
inserts into the lesser tubercle of the humerus. It acts to adduct and internally rotate the
humerus.

(Choices D and E) The teres major muscle and long head of the triceps brachii form the
inferior and medial borders of the quadrangular space through which the axillary nerve
passes. Entrapment of the axillary nerve within the quadrangular space can cause sensory
loss over the lateral shoulder and impair shoulder abduction.

Educational objective:

Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is most often caused by compression of the brachial plexus
as it passes through the scalene triangle, the space bordered by the anterior and middle
scalene muscles and the first rib. Symptoms typically include upper extremity numbness,

tingling, and weakness that worsen with repetitive overhead arm movements. The presence of ctivate V
