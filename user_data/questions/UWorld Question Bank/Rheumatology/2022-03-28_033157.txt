A 35-year-old man comes to the clinic with acute right knee pain and swelling. His symptoms
have been present for a week and have moderately worsened over this period. The patient is
able to bear weight but has significant pain when climbing stairs or walking for extended
distances. He attempted treatment with ibuprofen, which provided prompt but only temporary
relief. Past medical history is unremarkable, though the patient was seen by his primary care
provider for a diarrheal illness 2 weeks before onset of the current symptoms. Examination
shows a moderate-sized effusion at the right knee. Cultures of a joint aspirate reveal no
bacteria. Which of the following is most likely associated with this patient's joint symptoms?

A. C1 inhibitor deficiency (5%)

B. High titers of antistreptolysin O antibodies (11%)
SY C. Histocompatibility antigen HLA-B27 (71%)
