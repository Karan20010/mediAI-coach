A 48-year-old previously healthy woman comes to the office due to progressively worsening
muscle weakness for the past 2 months. The patient has difficulty with activities such as
climbing stairs, getting up from chairs, and placing dishes in overhead cabinets. She also
reports a 4.5-kg (10-Ib) unintentional weight loss and occasional abdominal discomfort over
the same interval. Physical examination shows weakness of the shoulder and hip girdle
muscles. Other examination findings are shown in the image below.
