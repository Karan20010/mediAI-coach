The contractile mechanism in skeletal muscle depends on proteins (myosin II, actin,
tropomyosin, and troponin) as well as calcium ions. The thick filaments in skeletal muscle are
comprised of myosin molecules, with the heads of the myosin molecules forming cross-links
with actin during muscular contraction. Two actin chains comprise the thin filaments in skeletal
muscle. Tropomyosin molecules sit in the groove between the two actin chains, covering the
myosin binding sites on actin when the muscle is at rest. Troponin molecules are small
globular proteins situated alongside the tropomyosin molecules. Troponin is composed of
three subunits: troponin T, troponin |, and troponin C. Troponin T binds the other troponin
components to tropomyosin, troponin | binds the troponin-tropomyosin complex to actin, and
troponin C contains the binding sites for Caz. During excitation-contraction coupling, Caz is
released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When CaÂ» binds troponin C, tropomyosin shifts to
expose the actin binding sites for myosin, allowing contraction to occur.

(Choice A) Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that initiates muscle contraction in response
to motor neuron stimulation. Acetylcholine release from the motor neuron opens post-synaptic
ligand-gated ion channels, resulting in depolarization of the muscle cell. Depolarization then
causes release of Caz from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

(Choice B) Epinephrine is a catecholamine that is not directly involved in skeletal muscle
