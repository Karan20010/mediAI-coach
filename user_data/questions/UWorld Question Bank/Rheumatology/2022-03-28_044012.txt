characteristic skin findings. Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis may occur independently
or as a paraneoplastic manifestation of an underlying malignancy (especially
adenocarcinoma).

Muscle enzyme (eg, creatine kinase, aldolase) levels in inflammatory myopathies are
invariably elevated. Autoantibodies, especially antinuclear antibodies, are also present in most
cases; anti—histidyl-tRNA synthetase (anti—Jo-1) antibodies are less sensitive but more
specific for dermatomyositis and polymyositis. A biopsy can differentiate polymyositis from
dermatomyositis, which typically shows an endomysial inflammation without prominent
vascular involvement in a scattered or patchy distribution (in contrast, dermatomyositis causes
perifascicular inflammation in a segmental pattern without vasculopathy).

(Choices A and E) Acetylcholine receptor-binding antibodies occur in myasthenia gravis,
which is characterized by episodic weakness that initially affects the ocular/bulbar musculature
and worsens with repetition. Antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels cause Lambert-
Eaton myasthenic syndrome (proximal muscle weakness that improves with isometric
contraction), which is often associated with small cell lung cancer. Muscle biopsy in these
conditions is normal.

Choice B) Anticardiolipin antibodies are typically seen in antiphospholipid antibod
