The sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is a modified endoplasmic reticulum within skeletal muscle
cells. The SR forms a network of tubules with terminal cisterns that are in close contact with
the T tubules (cytoplasmic membrane invaginations), allowing the membrane depolarization
signal to reach the SR. The Ca-ATPase pump in the SR membrane actively sequesters
calcium to keep intracellular concentrations low. Cell membrane depolarization causes
calcium release from the SR into the cytoplasm via the SR ryanodine receptor.

Actin filaments, troponin complex (troponins C, T, and |), and tropomyosin form the thin
filaments of muscle fibers. In the resting state, tropomyosin covers the myosin binding sites
on the actin filaments. On release from the SR, calcium binds to troponin C on the thin
filaments (Choices A and C). This induces a conformation change in the troponin complex,
causing it to displace tropomyosin and expose the myosin binding sites on the actin filaments.

Myosin makes up the thick filaments of skeletal muscle. ATP is bound by the myosin head and
cleaved to form ADP and inorganic phosphate ion, which are retained at the myosin head.
When the myosin head binds to an actin filament, a conformational change causes the myosin
to pull the actin filament, leading to muscle contraction and ADP release. Anew ATP molecule
then is bound to the myosin head, causing release of the actin filament. The cycle then
repeats until calcium is displaced from troponin C and the myosin binding sites are again
