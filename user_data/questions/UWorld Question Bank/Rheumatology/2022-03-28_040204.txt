(Choice C) The oblique popliteal ligament is a wide, fibrous band that connects the posterior
distal femur to the posterior proximal tibia. It has small openings for nerves, vessels, and
muscle insertions. Injury would allow laxity of knee hyperextension.

(Choice D) The patellar ligament (tendon) is a very robust structure that represents the
inferior projection of the quadriceps femoris tendon. Injury causes impaired knee extension.

(Choice E) The posterior cruciate ligament extends from the medial condyle of the femur to
the posterior head of the tibia. Injury causes laxity of posterior movement of the tibia with
respect to the femur (eg, posterior drawer test).

Educational objective:

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can be damaged by sudden changes in direction or
awkward landings (eg, excessive internal rotation or valgus stress) during sports activity. ACL
tears are typically associated with rapid-onset hemarthrosis. Physical examination shows
anterior laxity of the tibia relative to the femur (eg, Lachman test, anterior drawer test).
