tenderness approximately 4 cm distal to the anteromedial joint margin of the knee. It
frequently results from obesity or overuse in athletes.

(Choices B and D) Popliteal (Baker) cysts are caused by swelling of the gastrocnemius or
semimembranosus bursa. They often form due to extrusion of synovial fluid from the knee
joint into the bursa in patients with osteoarthritis or inflammatory joint disease.

(Choice E) The suprapatellar bursa is located anteriorly between the distal femur and
quadriceps. Bursitis here is most often caused by a direct blow to the distal thigh or
prolonged/repetitive quadriceps activity (eg, running).

Educational objective:

A bursa is a fluid-filled synovial sac that serves to alleviate pressure from bony prominences
and reduce friction between muscles and tendons. Acute trauma or chronic repetitive pressure
can cause injury, leading to localized pain and tenderness. Prepatellar bursitis causes anterior
knee pain and is usually due to repetitive or prolonged kneeling.
