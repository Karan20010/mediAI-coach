Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate, risedronate) treat osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoclast-
mediated bone resorption. They have a chemical structure similar to that of pyrophosphate
and attach to hydroxyapatite binding sites on bony surfaces. Osteoclasts that resorb the bone
take up the bisphosphonate and are unable to adhere to the bony surface to continue
resorption. Bisphosphonates also decrease osteoclast proton production, induce osteoclast
apoptosis, and decrease development/recruitment of osteoclast precursor cells. The net result
is to slow the rate of bone loss, and some patients may experience a small increase in bone
mineral density.

(Choice A) Sclerostin is a glycoprotein produced by osteocytes that inhibits osteoblast bone
formation. Monoclonal antibody preparations (eg, romosozumab) that bind sclerostin reverse
this effect and facilitate increased osteoblast activity.

(Choice B) Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that decreases bone resorption by binding
to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) and blocking the
interaction between RANK-L and RANK (a receptor located on osteoclast surfaces), which is

required for preosteoclast maturation to osteoclasts.

(Choices C, D, and F) Teriparatide is a recombinant formulation identical to the 34-amino-

acid sequence at the N-terminal portion of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH). Similar to
