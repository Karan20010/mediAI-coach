and disease is limited to small (not medium-sized) vessels.

(Choice B) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome)
causes asthma and allergic rhinosinusitis. Biopsy generally shows eosinophilic infiltration in
the vessel wall with granulomas. Small arteries and veins are primarily affected, and
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are often positive.

(Choice C) Severe hypertriglyceridemia can cause abdominal pain due to acute pancreatitis,
but transmural vascular inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis would be atypical.

(Choice D) Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) occurs primarily in young smokers
and is marked by limb claudication or digital ulcers. Biopsy typically shows highly cellular,
inflammatory thrombi in small- to medium-sized vessels of the extremities; there is limited
involvement of the vessel wall (eg, intact internal elastic lamina, no fibrinoid necrosis).

Educational objective:

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by constitutional
manifestations and ischemic symptoms in the kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and
neurologic system. Biopsy will show segmental, transmural arterial inflammation with fibrinoid
necrosis and damage to the internal and external elastic lamina. PAN is often associated with

underlying viral hepatitis B and C. Activate V
