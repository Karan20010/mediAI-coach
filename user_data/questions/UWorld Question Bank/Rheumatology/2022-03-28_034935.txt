(Choice B) Flexion of the forearm is primarily accomplished by the biceps brachii, brachialis,
and brachioradialis muscles. None of these muscles originate on the lateral epicondyle.

(Choice C) Shoulder abduction is primarily accomplished by the supraspinatus and deltoid
muscles. Overuse of the supraspinatus leads to supraspinatus tendinopathy (ie, rotator cuff
tendinopathy).

(Choice D) Overuse of the abductor pollicis longus (thumb abduction) and extensor pollicis
brevis (thumb extension) can result in de Quervain tendinopathy, which causes thumb and
wrist pain.

Educational objective:

Lateral epicondylitis (ie, tennis elbow) is characterized by overuse of wrist extensor muscles

(eg, extensor carpi radialis, extensor digitorum), leading to angiofibroblastic tendinosis at their
attachment on the lateral epicondyle.
