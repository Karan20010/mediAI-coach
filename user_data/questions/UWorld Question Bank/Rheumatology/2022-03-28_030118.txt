flexors (eg, flexor carpi radialis).

phalanx; it does not contribute to DIP joint flexion.

(Choice D) The lumbrical muscles are intrinsic muscles of the hand that contribute to MCP
joint flexion and interphalangeal joint extension. Injury to the fourth lumbrical tendon would
decrease these functions in the small finger where the fourth lumbrical tendon inserts.

(Choice E) The palmar interosseous muscles are intrinsic muscles of the hand that adduct
the fingers and, in coordination with the dorsal interossei, assist in MCP joint flexion and
interphalangeal joint extension. Tendon injury would primarily decrease finger adduction.

Educational objective:

The flexor digitorum profundus tendon inserts onto the base of the distal phalanx and flexes
the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. It is susceptible to rupture when an actively flexed DIP
joint is forcefully hyperextended.
