(Choice B) The sartorius muscle is the longest muscle in the body. It originates from the
anterior superior iliac spine and inserts with the pes anserinus onto the anteromedial tibia shaft
near the tibial tuberosity. Pes anserinus bursitis commonly occurs in runners and causes
anteromedial knee pain.

(Choices C and D) The tendon of the biceps femoris (part of the hamstrings) inserts at the
styloid process of the head of the fibula. The medial condyle of the tibia is the insertion site for
the semimembranous muscle, the most medial of the hamstring muscles. The hamstring
muscles are involved in knee flexion and hip extension.

Educational objective:

The quadriceps muscle group is connected to the patella, which is attached to the tibial
tubercle by the patellar ligament. Repetitive quadriceps contraction (eg, jumping) in
adolescents can result in Osgood-Schlatter disease, which is characterized by focal anterior
knee pain and swelling due to chronic avulsion of the tibial tubercle.
