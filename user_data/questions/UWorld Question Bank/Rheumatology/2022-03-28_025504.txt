spinous processes of T7 to LS, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, inferior angle of the scapula,
and the lower 3 or 4 ribs. It inserts onto the bicipital groove of the humerus and adducts,
extends, and internally (not externally) rotates the arm.

(Choice B) Serratus anterior is a fan-shaped muscle in the lateral thorax. It originates from
the first 8 or 9 ribs and inserts onto various sections of the scapula. It is responsible for
anterolateral and rotational movements of the scapula. When the long thoracic nerve is
damaged, the muscle becomes paralyzed, resulting in winged scapula.

(Choice C) Subscapularis originates from the subscapular fossa of the scapula and inserts
onto the lesser tubercle of the humerus. It adducts and internally (not externally) rotates the
arm.

(Choice D) Supraspinatus originates from the supraspinatus fossa of the scapula and inserts

onto the superior aspect of the greater tubercle of the humerus. It abducts the arm.

Educational objective:

The rotator cuff muscles attach to the proximal humerus and move the arm at the shoulder.
Infraspinatus and teres minor are primarily responsible for external rotation. When one is torn,
the other hypertrophies to compensate, resulting in preserved strength in external rotation.
