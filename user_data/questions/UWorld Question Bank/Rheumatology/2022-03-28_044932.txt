NF-kB to regulate the transcription of leukoproliferative cytokines. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin
inhibitor that suppresses T cells by preventing IL-2 transcription. Neither drug targets the
purine degradation pathway and therefore is not significantly influenced by xanthine oxidase
inhibition.
(Choice E) Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase to disrupt folate metabolism and
inhibit the production of pyrimidine nucleotides. It is not affected by the inhibition of xanthine
oxidase in the purine degradation pathway.

Educational objective:

Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug that is metabolized into active metabolites by

HGPRT and, conversely, inactivated by xanthine oxidase. Coadministration with a xanthine

oxidase inhibitor (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) shunts azathioprine metabolism toward the

production of active metabolites, resulting in increased immunosuppression and risk of cellular

toxicity.
