= (Choice B) Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody that decreases bone resorption by binding
5 to the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) and blocking the
: interaction between RANK-L and RANK (a receptor located on osteoclast surfaces), which is
: required for preosteoclast maturation to osteoclasts.
+ 10 (Choices C, D, and F) Teriparatide is a recombinant formulation identical to the 34-amino-

acid sequence at the N-terminal portion of endogenous parathyroid hormone (PTH). Similar to
PTH, teriparatide stimulates maturation of preosteoblasts into bone-forming osteoblasts that
lay down collagen and eventually mineralize the matrix. Teriparatide also increases
gastrointestinal calcium absorption and renal tubular calcium reabsorption, which leads to
decreased urinary calcium excretion.

Educational objective:

Bisphosphonates have a chemical structure similar to that of pyrophosphate and attach to
hydroxyapatite binding sites on bony surfaces to inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts.
