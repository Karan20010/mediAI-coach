dermal appendages (eg, hair follicles, glands). Early symptoms often include finger swelling

and mild pruritus. With progression of the disease, patients may experience dermal sclerosis

(sclerodactyly), dermal ulcers, nail atrophy, and digital calcinosis.

(Choice A) Psoriasis is characterized by activation of antigen-presenting dendritic cells,
leading to recruitment and differentiation of T-helper cells, which in turn produce additional
inflammatory cytokines that stimulate keratinocyte proliferation and generate a neutrophilic
response (eg, focal microabscesses). However, psoriasis presents with well-demarcated,
scaly, erythematous plaques rather than skin thickening and ulceration.

(Choice C) The immune response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is characterized by
stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes; these cells subsequently activate macrophages, which can
differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into multinucleated Langhans giant cells.
Cutaneous tuberculosis may present with a variety of skin lesions (eg, papules, plaques,
pustules), but thickening and ulceration of digital skin are more consistent with SS.

(Choice D) Migration of T lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils is seen in the late acute
phase of asthma as well as in allergic and chronic urticaria. Urticaria manifests as acute
erythematous wheals, not chronic sclerodactyly and ulceration.
