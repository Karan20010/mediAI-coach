The central disturbance in SLE is excessive autoantibody production due to loss of self-
tolerance. Autoantibodies directed against nuclear components (anti-nuclear antibodies) are
the most characteristic feature of SLE. Autoantibody binding to self-antigens leads to the
formation of circulating immune complexes that deposit in various organs and cause
complement activation. Active SLE is therefore characterized by consumption of complement
with reduced serum complement levels.

(Choice B) Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are associated with rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). RA causes an inflammatory arthritis, primarily affecting the small joints of the hands and
wrists. Cutaneous manifestations of RA include subcutaneous nodules and leg ulcers, but a
malar rash is more consistent with SLE.

(Choice C) Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are typically found in primary biliary cirrhosis, which
typically presents with cholestatic symptoms (eg, pruritus, jaundice, malabsorption).

(Choice D) Disseminated gonococcal infection is characterized by fever, migratory
polyarthritis, and skin lesions. The lesions are typically scattered pustules on the arms and
legs and not a malar rash.

(Choice E) Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27 is seen with increased frequency in the
