detected on physical examination by joint-line tenderness during provocative maneuvers (eg,
McMurray test).

(Choice C) The patellar ligament (ie, patellar tendon) connects the inferior portion of the
patella to the tibial tuberosity. Patellar ligament rupture is associated with underlying
ligamentous damage (eg, autoimmune disease, overuse injury) and usually occurs following
forceful contraction of the quadriceps muscles while the knee is flexed (eg, landing after a
jump). Acomplete patellar ligament tear would result in swelling and a high-riding patella on
physical examination.

Educational objective:

The posterior cruciate ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the
femur. It originates from the anterolateral surface of the medial femoral condyle and inserts
into the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia. Its integrity can be tested in the clinical setting
by using the posterior drawer test.
