This patient has lunate dislocation after a fall onto an outstretched hand (FOOSH). Although
the force transmitted up the arm by a FOOSH can injure many different structures in the arm
(eg, elbow, humerus, shoulder), wrist complications are the most common (eg, lunate or
scaphoid dislocation/fracture, distal radius fracture).

The lunate is in the proximal row of carpal bones and can be identified on x-ray as the more
medial (ulnar) of the 2 bones that articulate with the radius. Volar dislocation of the lunate
can compress the median nerve within the carpal tunnel, resulting in wrist pain and numbness.
in the first (radial) 3% digits.

(Choice A) The trapezium is the most lateral (radial) of the distal carpal bones and articulates
with the first metacarpal.

(Choice B) The capitate is the largest carpal bone; it lies in the distal row at the center of the
wrist and articulates with the third metacarpal.

(Choice C) The scaphoid is the most lateral (radial) of the proximal carpal bones and
articulates with the radius. It is the carpal bone most frequently affected by a FOOSH;
dislocation or fracture of the scaphoid can present with wrist pain and tenderness in the
anatomic snuffbox. Scaphoid fractures have a high risk of avascular necrosis.
