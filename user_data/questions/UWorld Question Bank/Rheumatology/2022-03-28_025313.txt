(Choice A) Obturator nerve injury presents with weakness of thigh adduction and medial thigh
sensory loss. It is most commonly seen as an iatrogenic complication of pelvic surgery.

(Choice C) Peroneal nerve injury often presents with loss of dorsal foot sensation and foot
drop due to weakness of foot eversion, dorsiflexion, and toe extension. It is typically caused
by compression of the nerve at the proximal fibula (eg, from leg casting).

(Choice D) Tibial nerve injury causes numbness at the sole and is typically associated with
decreased inversion and plantarflexion of the foot and flexion of the toes. Common causes
include knee trauma and tarsal tunnel syndrome.

(Choice E) Weakened abduction of the thigh occurs with superior gluteal nerve injury and
results in a Trendelenburg gait. There are no associated sensory deficits.

Educational objective:

Femoral nerve mononeuropathy can occur due to trauma; compression from a retroperitoneal
hematoma or abscess, or injury during surgery or childbirth. Findings include quadriceps
weakness, decreased patellar reflex, and sensory loss over the anterior and medial thigh and

medial leg.
