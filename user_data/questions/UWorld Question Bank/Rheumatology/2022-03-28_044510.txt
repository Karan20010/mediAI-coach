Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis is a vasculitis that only affects the skin and typically
arises due to drug or pathogen exposure (eg, hepatitis B or C virus). Drugs known to cause
this condition include penicillins, cephalosporins, sulfonamides, phenytoin, and allopurinol.
On skin examination, nonblanching palpable purpura is usually present and often involves the
lower extremities. When biopsied, these skin lesions histologically demonstrate markedly
inflamed small blood vessels with fibrinoid necrosis. In the first 24 hours, the perivascular
inflammatory cell population consists primarily of neutrophils and fragmented neutrophilic
nuclei (leukocytoclastic vasculitis), with mononuclear cells predominating in older lesions.

(Choice A) Erythema nodosum is a form of panniculitis (inflammation of subcutaneous fat)
that typically presents with painful erythematous nodules in the lower extremities.
Histopathologic findings include widening of connective tissue septae due to neutrophilic
infiltration and fibrin exudation, followed by histiocyte and giant cell infiltration with septal
fibrosis.

(Choice B) Giant cell vasculitis (temporal arteritis) affects medium- and large-sized arteries
and typically presents with unilateral headache and jaw claudication in individuals age >50.

Histopathologic findings include focal granulomatous inflammation of the media and internal
elastic lamina fragmentation.
