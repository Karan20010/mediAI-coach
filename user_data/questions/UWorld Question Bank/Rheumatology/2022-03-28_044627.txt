Educational objective:

Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis is associated with medication (eg, penicillins,
cephalosporins) use and typically presents with palpable purpura in the lower extremities.
Characteristic histopathologic findings include marked perivascular inflammation of small blood
vessels with fibrinoid necrosis and a predominance of neutrophils and fragmented neutrophilic

nuclei (leukocytoclastic vasculitis).
