The most common presenting symptom is nonblanching palpable purpura over the back,
buttocks, and lower extremities, as seen in this patient. Colicky abdominal pain due to local
vasculitis is also common, and other findings can include arthralgia/arthritis affecting the
hips, knees, and/or ankles.

Renal involvement occurs in over one-third of children with HSP and is due to mesangial
deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes, similar to lgA nephropathy. Most patients,
especially young children, develop mild nephritis characterized by hematuria, red cell casts,
and nonnephrotic-range proteinuria. Serum creatinine is typically normal or slightly elevated.
However, more severe complications (eg, acute kidney injury) can occur in a minority of
patients.

(Choice A) Membranous nephropathy is characterized by thickening of the glomerular
basement membrane. It is far more common in adults than children and presents with edema
and nephrotic-range proteinuria (23+). Moreover, purpura would not be expected.

(Choice B) Goodpasture syndrome, which typically affects adolescents and adults, is
characterized by glomerulonephritis due to linear deposition of IgG antibodies on the
basement membrane. Associated findings include pulmonary hemorrhage, not purpura or

abdominal pain.
