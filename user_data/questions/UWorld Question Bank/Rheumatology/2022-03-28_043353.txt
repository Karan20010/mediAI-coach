This patient's upper extremity neurologic symptoms in the setting of an extra rib are highly
suggestive of thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). The thoracic outlet refers to the region above
the first rib and behind the clavicle that is bordered by the cervical vertebral bones and the
sternum. Compression of the brachial plexus as it passes through the thoracic outlet can
cause upper extremity numbness, tingling, and weakness (most often in an ulnar distribution
due to compression of the lower trunk). Involvement of the subclavian vein and artery can
also occur and lead to upper extremity swelling and exertional arm pain.

TOS most commonly occurs due to compression of the brachial plexus within the scalene
triangle, which is formed by the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the first rib. The
anterior scalene muscle originates from the C3-C6 transverse processes and attaches to the
scalene tubercle of the first rib. The middle scalene originates from the C2-C7 transverse
processes and inserts into the posterior portion of the first rib. The brachial plexus trunks and
subclavian artery pass between the anterior and middle scalenes; the subclavian vein runs
anterior to the anterior scalene.

The presence of an anomalous cervical rib or scalene muscular anomalies can predispose
to TOS. Affected patients typically have a history of trauma or repetitive overhead arm
movements (eg, swimming, stacking boxes).
