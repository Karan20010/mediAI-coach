Educational objective:

Flattening of the deltoid muscle with acromial prominence after a shoulder injury suggests an
anterior humerus dislocation. This injury most commonly results from a blow to an externally
rotated and abducted arm. There is often associated axillary nerve injury, resulting in deltoid
paralysis and loss of sensation over the lateral shoulder.
