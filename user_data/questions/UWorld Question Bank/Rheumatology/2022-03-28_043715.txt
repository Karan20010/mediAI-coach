(Choice C) Liver hydroxylation is a phase | oxidation transformation catalyzed by the
cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. Addition of a hydroxyl group reduces lipid
solubility and facilitates excretion.

(Choice D) Liver sulfate conjugation is a phase II metabolic pathway that biotransforms drugs
into more polar compounds that are more water soluble and easily excreted.

(Choice E) Certain drugs are hydrolyzed by plasma esterases, which rapidly cleave ester
linkages after the drug enters the circulation. This rapid inactivation allows for the short
duration of action of these medications. Many drugs used in anesthesia (eg, succinylcholine,
tetracaine, remifentanil) are metabolized by plasma hydrolysis.

(Choice F) A few drugs are not metabolized in the body. They are excreted in the urine
mostly unchanged and are still pharmacologically active.

Educational objective:

Drug-induced lupus erythematosus (DILE) is characterized by abrupt onset of lupus symptoms
(eg, fever, arthralgias, pleuritis) with positive anti-histone antibodies. It has been linked to
drugs metabolized by N-acetylation in the liver (eg, procainamide, hydralazine, isoniazid).
Genetically predisposed individuals who are slow acetylators are at greater risk for developing
