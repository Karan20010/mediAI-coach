(Choice B) Avascular necrosis (AVN) of bone is characterized by degeneration of cortical
bone due to loss of arterial circulation. It usually occurs in locations that have limited or
retrograde blood supply (eg, head of femur); other than the scaphoid and lunate, it is rare in
the hands and wrists. Also, this patient has no risk factors (eg, glucocorticoid use) for AVN.

(Choice C) Osteolytic skeletal metastasis is common in lung adenocarcinoma but typically
affects the spine, pelvis, ribs, and long bones rather than distal limbs. Calcium is often but not

always elevated.

(Choice D) Generalized bone mineral loss is characteristic of osteoporosis, which is typically

painless in the absence of fracture.

Educational objective:

Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is characterized by abnormal growth of new bone and presents
with digital clubbing, painful arthropathy, periostosis of long bones, and joint effusions. It
commonly occurs in the setting of pulmonary malignancy, primarily adenocarcinoma, other
lung disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis), and cyanotic heart disease.
