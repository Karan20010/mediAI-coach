(Choice A) Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter that initiates muscle contraction in response
to motor neuron stimulation. Acetylcholine release from the motor neuron opens post-synaptic
ligand-gated ion channels, resulting in depolarization of the muscle cell. Depolarization then
causes release of Ca from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

(Choice B) Epinephrine is a catecholamine that is not directly involved in skeletal muscle
contraction. However, epinephrine stimulates B2-adrenergic receptors to increase skeletal
muscle blood flow, glycogenolysis, and lipolysis.

(Choices C and D) Calmodulin and myosin light-chain kinase are elements of the contractile
mechanism in smooth muscle, not skeletal muscle.

Educational objective:
The contractile mechanism in skeletal muscle depends on proteins (myosin II, actin,
tropomyosin, and troponin) as well as calcium ions.
