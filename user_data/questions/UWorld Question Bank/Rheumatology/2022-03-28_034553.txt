disruption, and swelling of the surrounding soft tissue. Staphylococcus aureus is implicated
in most cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis in otherwise healthy children.

(Choice A) Enterococcus faecalis causes a variety of infections, including endocarditis,
meningitis, and urinary tract infections. Enterococcus can cause vertebral osteomyelitis after a
recent urinary tract infection via bacteremic spread.

(Choice B) Moraxella catarrhalis is a part of the normal flora of the upper respiratory tract. It
causes otitis media and sinusitis in healthy individuals and is frequently responsible for
causing exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

(Choice D) Staphylococcus epidermidis is ubiquitous in nature and is commonly isolated in
cultures as a contaminant. However, S epidermidis can also be pathogenic, colonizing
intravenous catheters and other foreign bodies such as prosthetic heart valves and orthopedic
hardware, leading to bacteremia and sepsis.

(Choice E) Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus) frequently colonizes the
gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts. Infants born vaginally to colonized mothers can develop
serious neonatal infections, including sepsis, pneumonia, and meningitis. For this reason,
pregnant women testing positive for group B streptococci are treated with antibiotic prophylaxis

during labor and delivery.
