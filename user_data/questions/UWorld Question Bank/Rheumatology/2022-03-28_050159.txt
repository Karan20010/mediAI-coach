formation by stimulating maturation of pre-osteoblasts into osteoblasts.

Osteoblasts synthesize bone matrix and express alkaline phosphatase (AIkKP), which
promotes normal bone mineralization by increasing local concentrations of inorganic
phosphorus. Serum AlkP levels correlate with osteoblastic activity. However, total serum
levels are nonspecific, as AlkP is also produced by the hepatobiliary tree, intestine, and
placenta and may be elevated due to other causes (eg, pregnancy, biliary obstruction). If the
source of AIkP is uncertain, AlkP isoenzymes (ie, liver, placental, intestinal, bone) can be
differentiated with additional laboratory techniques (eg, electrophoresis, immunoassay). Other
markers of osteoblast activity include N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen (PINP),
which is released during post-translation cleavage of type 1 procollagen before its assembly

into mature type 1 collagen fibrils.

(Choice B) Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is predominantly found in liver, muscle, and
kidneys. AST is commonly used as a marker for hepatic injury and is also elevated in
