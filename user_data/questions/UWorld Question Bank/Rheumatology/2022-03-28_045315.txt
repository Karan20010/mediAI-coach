(Choice C) Primary biliary cholangitis (previously primary biliary cirrhosis) is an autoimmune
liver disease that can present with cholestasis, malabsorption, pruritus, and jaundice.
Although the risk of this condition is increased in patients with autoimmune disease (eg,
CREST syndrome, Sjégren syndrome), the association with dermatomyositis is not common.

(Choice D) Tropheryma whippelii infection (Whipple disease) typically presents with arthritis,
diarrhea, and fever. Patients may develop hyperpigmentation, but skin and muscle symptoms
are otherwise not prominent.

(Choice E) Type 2 diabetes is due to insulin resistance, which may also cause acanthosis
nigricans, a condition characterized by velvety patches of brownish discoloration affecting the
neck and skinfolds.

Educational objective:

Dermatomyositis is characterized by proximal muscle weakness resembling polymyositis, with
additional inflammatory features involving the skin (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules). Both
dermatomyositis and polymyositis may occur alone or as a paraneoplastic syndrome
associated with an underlying adenocarcinoma (eg, ovary, lung, pancreas).
