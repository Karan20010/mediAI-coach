(Choice D) The obturator externus arises from the anteromedial surface of the obturator
foramen and inserts near the greater trochanter of the femur. This muscle is a lateral rotator of
the thigh.

(Choice F) The vastus medialis is a component of the quadriceps femoris. It arises from the
proximal femur and ultimately inserts into the tibial tuberosity by means of the patella. It
functions as a knee extensor.

Educational objective:

Muscles used when sitting up from the supine position include the external abdominal
obliques, the rectus abdominis, and the hip flexors. The iliopsoas muscle is the most
important of the hip flexors and includes the psoas major, psoas minor, and iliacus. The rectus
femoris, sartorius, tensor fascia lata, and the medial compartment of the thigh also contribute

to hip flexion.
