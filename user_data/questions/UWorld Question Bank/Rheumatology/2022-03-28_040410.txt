(Choice B) The medial deltoid ligament complex is stronger than the other ligaments and is
not commonly injured. Forced eversion of the ankle can damage the deltoid ligament but more
commonly causes an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus.

(Choice C) The subtalar joint is at the posterior junction between the talus and the calcaneus
and is reinforced by the talocalcaneal ligaments. The joint is involved with inversion, eversion,
dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion of the foot, but is infrequently injured.

(Choice E) Dorsiflexion and/or eversion of the ankle can cause a high ankle sprain affecting
the syndesmotic structures (interosseous membrane and anterior, posterior, and transverse
tibiofibular ligaments), which connect the tibia and fibula. Injury to these structures is
uncommon as they can withstand severe forces. Patients usually have an unstable ankle joint
with tenderness at the distal tibiofibular joint, but no significant swelling.

Educational objective:

Lateral ankle sprain is due to inversion of a plantar-flexed foot and most commonly involves
the anterior talofibular ligament. Stronger forces can cause joint instability by injuring
additional ligaments.
