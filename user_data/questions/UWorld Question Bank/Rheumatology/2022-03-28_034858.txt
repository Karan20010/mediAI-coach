(Choice B) The iliolumbar ligament connects the fifth lumbar vertebrae to the iliac crest,
strengthening the lumbosacral joint.

(Choice C) The interspinous ligaments connect the spinous processes and help limit flexion
of the spine.

(Choice E) The sacroiliac ligament prevents distraction of the sacroiliac joint.

Educational objective:

Spinal stenosis occurs most commonly in the lumbar region and presents with posture-
dependent lower extremity pain, numbness/paresthesia, and weakness. The most common
cause is degenerative arthritis of the spine, which results in narrowing of the spinal canal due
to intervertebral disc herniation, ligamentum flavum hypertrophy, and osteophyte formation
affecting the facet joints.
