The C5 through T1 nerve roots form the brachial plexus trunks, divisions, cords, and ultimately
terminal branches, which supply sensory and motor innervation to the upper extremities. This
patient has deficits involving both the radial (eg, triceps reflex, wrist extension) and median
(sensation to palm and index and middle finger) nerves. This pattern of deficits across
multiple peripheral nerves indicates a lesion proximal to the formation of the terminal
branches.

In a patient without history of trauma or malignancy, chronic shoulder and radicular arm pain
with sensorimotor deficits is most likely caused by compression of a nerve root due to cervical
spondylosis. The C7 root is the most frequently affected nerve root in patients with cervical
radiculopathy, resulting in deficits across the median and radial nerve distributions.

(Choices B and C) Damage to the superior or inferior trunk most often occurs as a result of
trauma (eg, traction during delivery in infants; falls in adults). A superior trunk lesion (eg, Erb-
Duchenne palsy) would result in loss of arm abduction, elbow flexion, and wrist extension
(waiter's tip position: adducted arm with extended elbow and flexed wrist). An inferior trunk
lesion (eg, Klumpke palsy) typically results in loss of wrist/metacarpophalangeal joint flexion
and interphalangeal joint extension (claw hand position: extended wrist/metacarpophalangeal
joints with flexed interphalangeal joints).
