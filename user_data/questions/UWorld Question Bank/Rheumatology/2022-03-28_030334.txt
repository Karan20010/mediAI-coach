This patient likely has myositis ossificans (MO), characterized by the formation of lamellar
bone in extraskeletal tissues (ie, heterotopic ossification). MO is typically triggered by
severe (eg, fracture, muscle contusion) or recurrent trauma that initiates the expression of
bone morphogenic proteins, which promote in-migration of spindle stem cells. These cells
differentiate to fibroblasts (which produce collagen and extracellular matrix) and subsequently
to chondrocytes and osteoblasts (which are responsible for production of osteoid and
mineralization).

MO typically presents as a painful, firm, mobile mass. It is most common in the quadriceps
and brachialis muscles but can occasionally occur in other muscles. X-ray typically shows
intramuscular calcification with radiolucent zones (eggshell calcification). Histologic
examination often shows a zonal pattern with outer areas of relatively mature bone (benign
metaplastic bone tissue) and inner regions of fibroblastic proliferation (without mitotic
atypia) and variable amounts of collagen and osteoid.

(Choice B) Closely packed, small, round, uniform neoplastic cells are a typical finding in
Ewing sarcoma, which presents with bone pain and swelling, often accompanied by fever.
Although it may occur in young adults, it is more common in children and is usually fixed to the
bone, not mobile.
