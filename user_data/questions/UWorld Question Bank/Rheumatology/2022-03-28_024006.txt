This patient has Dupuytren contracture (DC), a condition caused by progressive fibrosis of
the superficial palmar fascia. The disease typically involves the fascia at the base of the
middle, ring, and little fingers. Although the etiology of DC is unknown, risk factors include age
>50, male sex, family history, and Northern European ancestry.

DC is thought to be caused by overstimulation of the Wnt-signaling pathway, which regulates
cellular proliferation. Initial findings include painless fascial thickening with puckering of the
skin just proximal to the affected metacarpophalangeal joint(s). As fibrosis continues,
pathognomonic fascial nodules form along the flexor tendons composed of

proliferating fibroblasts and disordered type III collagen. The nodules eventually coalesce
into palpable fibrotic cords that tether the flexor tendon to the palmar fascia, leading to loss
of finger extension (ie, contractures) at the metacarpophalangeal and proximal
interphalangeal joints.

(Choice B) Heterotopic bone formation in muscles is characteristic of myositis ossificans, a
benign condition that develops after contusion to large muscle groups (eg, quadriceps
femoris), not small muscles such as the lumbricals. Patients typically report pain in the
affected muscle and a palpable lump (ie, heterotopic bone) deep in the muscle.

(Choice C) Linear deposits of calcium hydroxyapatite in the periarticular structures cause a
