This child has blue sclerae and a history of several fractures after only minimal trauma.
These findings are suggestive of osteogenesis imperfecta (Ol), a disease caused by
impaired synthesis of type 1 collagen by osteoblasts. Clinical manifestations are variable and
can range from mild defects to lethal disease in utero. In most patients, Ol is transmitted by
autosomal dominant inheritance.

Type 1 collagen is the predominant collagen in osteoid (organic portion of bone matrix) and
allows bone to be somewhat flexible while still maintaining strength. Type 1 collagen is also
present in teeth, ligaments, skin, and sclerae. In Ol, deficiency of type 1 collagen causes
brittle bones that are prone to fracture. Other manifestations include blue sclerae due to the
deficient connective tissue allowing transparency of underlying vessels and small, malformed
teeth (dentinogenesis imperfecta). Joints can have excessive laxity, and some patients are
also susceptible to bruising and hearing loss.

(Choice A) Bones are formed by endochondral ossification (eg, long bones) and
intramembranous ossification (eg, flat bones). Endochondral ossification involves the
deposition of hyaline cartilage by chondrocytes and is impaired in achondroplasia, which is
unlikely in a patient of normal stature.

(Choice B) Bone matrix comprises inorganic (eg, hydroxyapatite crystals) and organic (eg,
