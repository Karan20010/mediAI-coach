This patient has greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) characterized by lateral hip
pain. GTPS is an overuse tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus at their
insertion on the greater trochanter of the femur. It is often referred to as trochanteric bursitis,
although bursal involvement varies and is not likely the primary pathology. Risk factors include
obesity, plantar fasciitis, and altered gait mechanics (eg, osteoarthritis).

The gluteus medius and gluteus minimus originate from the upper and lower gluteal surfaces
of the ilium, respectively, and insert onto the greater trochanter. Their primary functions
include:

¢ Hip abduction
¢ Hip external rotation (internal rotation when the hip is flexed [eg, leg crossing])
¢ Horizontal stabilization of the pelvis during ambulation

Examination typically is notable for point tenderness over the greater trochanter. The pain
is reproduced by hip abduction and internal rotation (when the hip is flexed) against resistance
because muscle contraction stresses the tendons. Sitting with the affected leg crossed over
the other can also produce pain. Muscular weakness or tendon rupture is suggested by the
Trendelenburg sign: with the patient standing on the affected leg, the pelvis falls to the

contralateral side due to impaired abduction.
