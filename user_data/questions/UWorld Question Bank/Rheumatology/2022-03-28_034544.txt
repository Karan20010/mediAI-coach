Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone and bone marrow that occurs by 1 of 3 mechanisms:

1. Hematogenous seeding due to an episode of bacteremia
2. Spread from a contiguous focus of infection, as occurs in an infected diabetic foot wound
3. Direct inoculation of bone, such as with a compound fracture

Hematogenous osteomyelitis occurs predominantly in children (particularly boys) and most
frequently affects the long bones. The tibia, fibula, and femur are most often involved. Adults
who develop the condition are more likely to have vertebral involvement and frequently have a
predisposition to bacteremia due to risk factors such as IV drug abuse or indwelling vascular
catheters.

The presenting symptoms of hematogenous osteomyelitis are vague, and a high index of
suspicion is required to make the diagnosis. Initial symptoms such as malaise and fevers are
non-specific. As the infection progresses, infants and younger children may refuse to move
the affected extremity. Older children often complain of pain over a long bone. Bone pain
develops as the abscess expands within the bone, leading to bone necrosis, periosteal
