and group II sensory axons and are sensitive to changes in muscle length. Muscle spindles
mediate the stretch reflex (myotatic reflex), which is commonly tested (deep tendon reflexes)
during the neurologic examination. When a muscle is stretched, there is monosynaptic reflex
activation of the a motor neuron (of the same muscle), causing contraction that resists the
stretch.

(Choices D and E) Pacinian corpuscles are rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors located in the
subcutaneous tissue of the skin as well as the mesentery, peritoneum, and joint capsules.
Ruffini’s end organs are slowly adapting mechanoreceptors that exist in the skin,
subcutaneous tissue, and joint capsule. Both help to mediate touch, proprioception, and
vibratory sensation and are innervated by myelinated A-beta fibers.

Educational objective:

The muscle spindle system is a feedback system that monitors and maintains muscle length,
while the Golgi tendon system is a feedback system that monitors and maintains muscle
force. GTOs are exquisitely sensitive to increases in muscle tension but are relatively
insensitive to passive stretch.
