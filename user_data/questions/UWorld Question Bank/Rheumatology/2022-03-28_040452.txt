(Choice E) Plasminogen activators such as streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen
activator convert plasminogen to plasmin. Of these 3 enzymes, only streptokinase, an

exotoxin released by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus), is a bacterial product.
Streptococcal skin infection is usually marked by spreading, nonpurulent cellulitis, not gas

gangrene.

(Choice F) Inhibition of presynaptic acetylcholine release is the mechanism of action of
botulinum toxin, which primarily causes cranial neuropathy and descending paralysis.

(Choice G) Certain Staphylococcus aureus—produced toxins act as superantigens by
hyperstimulating T cells and causing massive cytokine production. Examples include
enterotoxin, which causes food poisoning, and toxic shock syndrome toxin. S aureus can
cause purulent cellulitis, but rapid-onset gas gangrene is atypical.

Educational objective:

Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the main toxin produced by Clostridium perfringens. \t degrades
lecithin, a component of cellular phospholipid membranes, which leads to membrane
destruction, cell death, and widespread necrosis and hemolysis.
