verted by xanthine oxidase (or thiopurine methyltransferase) into inactive metabolites
re excreted in the urine. The remainder is converted by HGPRT into active metabolites

(6-thioguanines), which act as false nucleotides that incorporate into DNA and RNA and inhibit
hematopoietic cell proliferation. Therefore, when a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is combined
with azathioprine, 6-MP is shunted toward conversion into active metabolites, leading to
increased immunosuppression and risk of cellular toxicity.

ice B) Ganciclovir is similar in structure to guanosine and forms false purine nucleotides
isrupt DNA synthesis. It is relatively specific for viral DNA replication enzymes; it does
eract with allopurinol because it is not catabolized by xanthine oxidase.

ices C and D) Prednisone exerts a nonspecific immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting

NF-kB to regulate the transcription of leukoproliferative cytokines. Tacrolimus is a calcineurin

‘or that suppresses T cells by preventing IL-2 transcription. Neither drug targets the

purine degradation pathway and therefore is not significantly influenced by xanthine oxidase

ion.

ice E) Trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate reductase to disrupt folate metabolism and

inhibi

the production of pyrimidine nucleotides. It is not affected by the inhibition of xanthine

oxidase in the purine degradation pathway.
