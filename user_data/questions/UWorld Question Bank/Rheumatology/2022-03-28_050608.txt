A 66-year-old postmenopausal woman comes to the office to discuss her bone densitometry
results. She has a history of hypertension and has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30
years. BMI is 20.1 kg/m2. Physical examination is unremarkable. Bone densitometry reveals
low bone density consistent with osteoporosis. The patient is prescribed risedronate. Repeat
bone densitometry 2 years later reveals no further loss of bone mineral density. Which of the
following mechanisms most likely explains the drug's effect on bone mineral density?

A. Decreased osteocyte-mediated inhibition of bone formation (1%)
B. Decreased stimulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B (7%)
C. Decreased urinary calcium excretion (0%)
D. Increased intestinal calcium absorption (1%)
YE. Inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption (87%)

F. Stimulation of preosteoblasts to mature osteoblasts (1%)
