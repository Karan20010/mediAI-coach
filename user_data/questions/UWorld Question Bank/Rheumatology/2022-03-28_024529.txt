The major muscles responsible for hip flexion are the rectus femoris, iliopsoas, and

sartorius. These muscles originate on the pelvis and spinal column and cross the hip joint

anteriorly, giving them the capacity to carry out this motion. This patient has impairment not
only with hip flexion but also with knee extension. Of these muscles, only the sartorius and

rectus femoris (part of quadriceps femoris) also cross the knee and therefore can influence

both hip and knee movements.

The rectus femoris originates from the anterior inferior iliac spine and the ilium and inserts at
the base of the patella via the quadriceps tendon, allowing it to flex the hip and also extend
the knee upon contraction. The rectus femoris (and quadriceps as a whole) also provides
stability and control during ambulation, deceleration (eg, landing a jump), and rapid changes in
movement (eg, cutting in soccer).

In contrast, the sartorius originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and crosses the
anterior thigh to insert at the superomedial surface of the tibia. Because of its oblique
orientation across the anterior thigh, the sartorius is responsible for hip flexion, external
rotation, and abduction as well as knee flexion (not extension) (Choice D). This combination
of movements is needed to sit in a cross-legged position.

(Choice A) The biceps femoris, along with semitendinosus and semimembranosus, form the
