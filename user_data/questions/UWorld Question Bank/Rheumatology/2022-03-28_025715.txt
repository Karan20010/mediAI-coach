size and quantity of mitochondria) and also increases capillary density. In contrast, resistance
training (eg, heavy weightlifting) amplifies the characteristics of type II fibers while also
stimulating increased muscle mass.

(Choice A) Anaerobic glycolytic enzymes will decrease and aerobic oxidative enzymes will
increase with endurance training.

(Choice C) Muscle fibers are arranged into a motor unit, with each unit innervated by a single
motor neuron and endplate. Although the size and metabolic characteristics of muscle fibers
change with training, the number of muscle fibers within a motor unit or endplates per fiber
does not change.

(Choices D and E) Endurance training amplifies the phenotypic characteristics of existing
type | fibers; however, the total quantity of muscle fibers (myocytes) or the proportion of each
type of muscle fiber does not significantly change with training.

Educational objective:

Type | muscle fibers (slow-twitch or red fibers) primarily use oxidative phosphorylation and
contain high quantities of lipids, myoglobin, and mitochondria. They specialize in sustained,
low force contraction, and their function is amplified by endurance training. Type Il muscle

fibers (fast-twitch or white fibers) primarily use glycolysis and specialize in rapid bursts of high
