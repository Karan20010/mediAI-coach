(Choice E) Diuretics (eg, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) can be associated with gout as
these medications reduce urate excretion in the proximal tubule and also cause volume
depletion leading to decreased renal perfusion and filtration of uric acid. This patient has a
normal serum creatinine level, indicating adequate renal function.

Educational objective:

Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation are at increased risk of gout due to
medications that impair renal clearance of uric acid. Cyclosporine is particularly associated
with gout in the post-transplantation period due to decreased uric acid excretion.
