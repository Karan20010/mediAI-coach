This patient has swelling, pain, and morning stiffness in multiple joints for >6 weeks, consistent

with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The foundation of management for RA is disease-modifying

antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which alleviate pain and inflammation and reduce long-term

joint destruction and disability. Examples of DMARDS are methotrexate (typically first-line),

sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, minocycline, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors.

However, the response to DMARD therapy typically takes weeks (Choices B, C, D, and F).
Therefore, short-term treatment with anti-inflammatory therapies, including systemic and
intraarticular glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), can provide rapid, temporary relief of symptoms in patients starting on DMARDs.
However, they do not provide adequate long-term control of disease or prevention of joint
deformity.

Glucocorticoids exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting phospholipase A2, which
decreases prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis. Glucocorticoids also depress the immune
response by inhibiting the transcription of multiple cytokines and adhesion proteins, which
reduces leukocyte recruitment and activation.

(Choice A) Colchicine is used in the management of both acute and chronic gout. Colchicine

works by binding to tubulin and inhibiting microtubule polymerization. This results in disruption
