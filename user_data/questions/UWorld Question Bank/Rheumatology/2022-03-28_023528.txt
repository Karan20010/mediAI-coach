This patient has a soft, mobile, subcutaneous mass consistent with a lipoma. Lipomas are
very common, benign tumors that arise from the subcutaneous fat. They typically occur in
middle-aged adults and are generally stable or enlarge slowly over time. The overlying
epidermis is normal.

The diagnosis of lipoma is usually easy to make on clinical examination. However, if
necessary, excisional biopsy can be performed and shows well-differentiated, mature
adipocytes with an intact fibrous capsule. Because lipomas are generally harmless, most can
be left in place, although excision can be considered for cosmetic reasons or patient
discomfort.

(Choice B) Osteosarcoma is usually seen in children and young adults; it is uncommon in
older adults, in which it is often associated with Paget disease of bone. It presents with local
pain and swelling; the mass, if palpable, is nonmobile. Histopathology shows pleomorphic
malignant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei forming neoplastic osteoid or bone.

(Choice C) Erythema nodosum presents acutely as tender, subcutaneous nodules in the
lower extremities. It occurs in association with a variety of infectious (eg, herpes simplex) and
inflammatory (eg, sarcoidosis) conditions. Histopathology shows inflammation in the
subcutaneous fat (panniculitis) with edema, fibrinous exudate, and a variable cellular infiltrate
