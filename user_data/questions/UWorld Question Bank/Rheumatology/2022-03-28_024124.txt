matrix that invades the existing bone.

(Choice B) Ewing sarcoma, the second most common primary bone malignancy in children

and adolescents, often arises in the diaphysis of long bones, causing progressive pain,

swelling, and lytic bone lesions. Histopathology shows sheets of small, round, blue cells; no

neoplastic osteoid or bone is produced.

(Choice C) Adenocarcinoma of the lung often metastasizes to bone. However, histopathology
shows glands lined by malignant cells that produce mucin.

(Choice D) Osteoid osteoma is a small, benign, bone-forming tumor that typically occurs in
the lower extremity of adolescent boys, causing pain that is characteristically worse at night.
Histopathology shows irregular woven bone lined by a single layer of benign-appearing
osteoblasts (not pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells).

Educational objective:

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and young

adults and typically arises near the metaphyses of long bones (eg, femur, tibia), causing

progressive pain and soft tissue swelling. X-ray typically reveals a lytic and sclerotic bone

lesion, and histopathology shows malignant tumor cells that produce neoplastic osteoid and

mineralized bone. Activate Windows
