20 Inflammatory markers (ie, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) have high
= sensitivity for GCA, but there are no specific serologic tests. The diagnosis is confirmed by
= temporal artery biopsy.
1s GCA can cause severe ischemic optic neuropathy due to ophthalmic artery occlusion, which
: can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. Other optic complications of GCA include
i amaurosis fugax, central or branch retinal artery occlusion, and cerebral infarction leading to
: = central visual field defects. GCA is therefore considered a medical emergency, and physicians
