and synovium, with subsequent free radical damage and crystal deposition. It typically

45 involves the second and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints (in contrast to
osteoarthritis of the hands, which most often affects the proximal and distal interphalangeal

18 joints and the first carpometacarpal joint). X-ray findings include characteristic deformities (eg,
