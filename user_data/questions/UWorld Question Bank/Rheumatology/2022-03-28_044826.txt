Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by:

¢ Cutaneous manifestations: Gottron papules (red or violaceous, flat-topped papules
over joints and bony prominences, especially on the hands) and heliotrope rash
(erythematous or violaceous edematous eruption on the upper eyelids and periorbital skin)

¢ Myopathy: Proximal muscle weakness (similar to polymyositis), elevated muscle
enzymes (eg, creatine kinase, aldolase)

Autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies (more sensitive) and anti-Jo-1 antibodies
(more specific), are frequently positive. Muscle biopsy confirms the diagnosis and shows

perifascicular inflammation and atrophy affecting a contiguous portion of the fascicle and
surrounding blood vessels.

Initial treatment includes systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone). Dermatomyositis may
occur alone or as a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with malignancy (especially
adenocarcinoma); affected patients should be evaluated for an underlying occult malignancy.

(Choice A) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (eg, physostigmine) are used in treatment of
myasthenia gravis, which presents with fluctuating and fatigable weakness that primarily
involves the ocular, bulbar, and respiratory muscles. The skin is not typically involved.
