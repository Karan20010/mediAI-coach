is patient with headaches, visual and muscular symptoms, an enlarged temporal artery, and

elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate has typical features of giant cell arteritis ([GCA]
temporal arteritis) with associated polymyalgia rheumatica. GCA is the most common
systemic vasculitis in persons of Northern European descent and occurs almost exclusively in

ients age >50.

hough both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms have been implicated in the
hogenesis of GCA, cell-mediated processes are of primary importance. The inflammatory

infiltrate in affected vessels is composed of lymphocytes (predominantly CD4-positive T cells)
and macrophages and frequently contains multinucleated giant cells. The production of

okines, in particular interleukin-6 (IL-6), appears to closely correlate with the severity of the

disease; a monoclonal antibody against IL-6 (tocilizumab) is effective in treating GCA.

(Choices A and B) Antibodies to myeloperoxidase and proteinase-3 are involved in the

hogenesis of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides such as

microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

(Choice C) B cell-activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis factor
ligand family. Inadequate levels of BAFF will lead to immunodeficiency, whereas excess levels

can cause autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).
