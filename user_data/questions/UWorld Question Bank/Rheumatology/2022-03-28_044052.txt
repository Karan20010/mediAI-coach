(Choice D) Noncontrast head CT is recommended for initial evaluation of patients with TIA
and stroke. However, this patient has no focal neurologic deficits, and her amaurosis and jaw
claudication are more consistent with GCA.

(Choice E) In addition to elevated ESR and CRP levels, other nonspecific signs of
inflammation, such as thrombocytosis, may be present in patients with GCA. However,
specific serologic markers, such as rheumatoid factor, are not elevated.

(Choice F) Echocardiography is recommended for patients with a suspected cardioembolic
event. Although cardioembolism may rarely present with amaurosis, this patient's other
features are more characteristic of GCA.

Educational objective:

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) have very high sensitivity

for giant cell (temporal) arteritis. Patients with suspected giant cell arteritis who have an

elevated ESR or CRP level should be referred for temporal artery biopsy to confirm the

diagnosis.
