Educational objective:

Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X-linked recessive myopathy that manifests with proximal
muscle weakness and enlargement of the calf muscles in boys age 2-5. It most often results
from frameshift deletions affecting the dystrophin gene. Dystrophin provides a stabilizing
interaction between the sarcolemma and the intracellular contraction apparatus, and disruption
of the protein results in membrane damage and myonecrosis.
