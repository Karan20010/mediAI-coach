weakness, but it is later replaced by fat and connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy). The
Gowers sign involves the use of one's hands to rise from a squat or from a chair to
compensate for proximal muscle weakness.

(Choice A) Endomysial inflammatory infiltration is found on muscle biopsy in polymyositis.
Dermatomyositis is associated with perifascicular inflammation. Both diseases cause proximal
muscle weakness but not distal muscle hypertrophy.

(Choice B) Endoneural inflammatory infiltration is characteristic of Guillain-Barré syndrome,
which classically manifests as ascending flaccid paralysis and hyporeflexia.

(Choice C) Examples of ion channel myopathies include hyper- and hypokalemic periodic
paralysis, which present with episodic, painless muscle weakness.

(Choice D) Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is due to mutation of the genes responsible for
myelin synthesis. Affected patients frequently present with distal muscle weakness, sensory
loss, and atrophy of the calf muscles (producing the characteristic stork leg deformity).

(Choice F) Mutations involving sarcomere proteins are responsible for hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy and certain forms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy.
