Educational objective:

Rheumatoid arthritis results from an immune response directed against autoantigens in the
joints. Infiltrating CD4- T cells secrete cytokines that promote inflammatory synovitis. They
also stimulate B cells to produce rheumatoid factor (IgM antibody specific for Fc component of
IgG) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies that contribute to chronic inflammation and joint
destruction.
