(Choice B) Thiazide diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide) increase reabsorption
of calcium in the distal renal tubule and are associated with a small decrease in the risk of
osteoporosis.
(Choice D) Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) may slightly decrease the risk of osteoporosis,

possibly due to increased formation and decreased resorption of bone.

(Choice E) Nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin) have been associated in some studies with increased
bone density, possibly due to decreased bone turnover.

Educational objective:

Long-term acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors may be associated with an increased
risk of osteoporotic fractures, possibly due to decreased calcium absorption. Other
medications associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis include glucocorticoids,
aromatase inhibitors, and anticonvulsants that induce cytochrome P450.
