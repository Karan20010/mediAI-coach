Question Id: 1795

This patient has amenorrhea and low bone density, suggesting a low-estrogen state. This may
be due to menopause, although her exercise history suggests possible hypothalamic
amenorrhea (excessive exercise suppresses secretion of GnRH, leading to decreased release
of FSH and low estrogen levels). Because estrogen decreases bone resorption, estrogen
deficiency in women increases the risk for osteoporosis. Although estrogen replacement
therapy (eg, ethinyl estradiol) can mitigate this risk, it can increase the risk of breast cancer
and should be avoided in patients with a family history of breast cancer (Choice B). In
addition, unopposed estrogen (ie, without concurrent progesterone) can cause endometrial
proliferation resulting in endometrial hyperplasia and cancer.

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (eg, raloxifene, tamoxifen) are nonsteroidal
compounds that bind estrogen receptors and exhibit antagonist and agonist properties in a
tissue-specific manner. Raloxifene has estrogen agonist activity on bone, which decreases
bone resorption, improves bone density, and decreases the risk of vertebral fractures. In
addition, raloxifene has an estrogen antagonist effect on breast tissue and can decrease the
risk of breast cancer. It also acts as an estrogen antagonist in the uterus and does not
increase the risk of endometrial cancer.

Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has strong estrogen antagonist
