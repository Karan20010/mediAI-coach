weakening in the connective tissues and abnormal activation of transforming growth factor

Marfan syndrome is caused by an inherited defect in the fibrillin-1 gene. Patients with Marfan
syndrome can often be identified due to a characteristic body habitus, with long thin
extremities, loose joints, and long fingers (arachnodactyly). The cause of death in Marfan
syndrome is most often due to cardiovascular complications (eg, aortic root dilation,
dissection, and rupture).

(Choice A) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a collection of heritable disorders of connective tissue
characterized by skin and joint hypermobility. Like those with Marfan syndrome, these patients
are at risk for aortic rupture. However, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects the formation and
extracellular structuring of collagen rather than microfibrils.

(Choice B) Homocystinuria is a rare inherited metabolic disorder due to cystathionine
synthase deficiency. It is characterized by very high circulating homocysteine levels,
marfanoid habitus, and increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

(Choice D) Osteogenesis imperfecta results from defects in the genes encoding type |
collagen, a major component of bones. Defects in type | collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta

result in reduced bone mass and fragility fractures. Other manifestations of the disease
