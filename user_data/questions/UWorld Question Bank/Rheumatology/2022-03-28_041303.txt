This patient has a posterior hip dislocation (ie, femoral head displaced posteriorly from the
acetabulum), which commonly occurs in head-on motor vehicle collisions in which the knee
strikes the dashboard or from a fall in frail, elderly patients. The risk is increased with
prosthetic joints.

On examination, the leg with a posterior hip dislocation appears shortened and internally
rotated, with the hip held in flexion and adduction. Range of motion is limited and painful.
Posterior hip dislocation can be mistaken for femoral neck fracture, which can also present
with leg shortening; however, the leg is typically rotated externally with femoral neck fracture
due to contraction of the iliopsoas without the normal acetabular counterforce.

The sciatic nerve runs posterior to the hip joint and is vulnerable to injury with posterior hip
dislocation. Findings of sciatic injury include weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, decreased
ankle reflex, and decreased sensation.

(Choices A and B) The femoral artery runs anterior to the hip and can be injured in anterior
(not posterior) dislocation, which is rare and typically occurs in association with additional
traumatic injuries (eg, hip fracture); examination shows abduction and external rotation of the
thigh. The femoral nerve also runs anterior to the hip joint; it is occasionally injured in hip
arthroplasty but is not at risk in posterior dislocation.
