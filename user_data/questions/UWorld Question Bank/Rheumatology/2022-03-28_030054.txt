A 17-year-old boy comes to the emergency department due to a right ring finger injury earlier
in the day. During a soccer match, he grabbed an opponent's jersey; as the opponent pulled
away suddenly, the patient instantly felt a popping sensation and pain in the right ring finger.
Examination of the hand shows swelling of the palmar aspect of the distal ring finger. When
asked to make a fist, the patient can flex the metacarpophalangeal and proximal
interphalangeal joints but is unable to flex the distal interphalangeal joint of the ring finger. The
tendon of which of the following muscles is most likely injured in this patient?
