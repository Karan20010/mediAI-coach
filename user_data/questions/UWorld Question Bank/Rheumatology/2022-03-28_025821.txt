Educational objective:

Injections given in the superomedial quadrant of the buttock have a high risk of injuring the
superior gluteal nerve, resulting in gluteus medius weakness and Trendelenburg gait. The
superolateral quadrant of the buttock is a relatively safe site for intragluteal injections, although

the anterolateral gluteal region is preferred.
