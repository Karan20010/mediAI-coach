= Question Id: 1704

This patient has a humerus fracture associated with wrist drop, suggesting a radial nerve

12 injury. The radial nerve is a terminal branch of the brachial plexus that carries fibers
= originating in the C5-T1 nerve roots. It innervates most of the forearm extensors at the elbow
15 (eg, triceps) and most of the hand extensors at the wrist. It also innervates the extrinsic
: extensors of the digits and the brachioradialis and supinator muscles. In addition, the radial
is nerve provides cutaneous sensory innervation to the dorsal hand, forearm, and upper arm.
: » Radial nerve deficits due to a midshaft humeral fracture raise concern for an associated

injury to the deep brachial artery. The deep brachial (profunda brachii) artery branches off the
23 brachial artery high in the arm, passes inferior to the teres major muscle, and courses
posteriorly along the humerus in close association with the radial nerve.

(Choice A) After giving off the deep brachial artery, the brachial artery continues

: 28 anteromedially until it branches to form the radial and ulnar arteries in the forearm.
= Supracondylar fractures of the humerus may injure the distal portion of the brachial artery but
31 are unlikely to injure the radial nerve or cause wrist drop.
* (Choice B) The common interosseous artery is a short branch of the ulnar artery that gives
rise to anterior, posterior, and recurrent branches within the proximal forearm.
