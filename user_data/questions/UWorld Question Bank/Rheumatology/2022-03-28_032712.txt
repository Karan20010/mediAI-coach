presentation is consistent with an acute gout flare, which occurs due to the deposition of
monosodium urate crystals within joint spaces (most commonly in the lower extremities).

Gout occurs in the setting of hyperuricemia, which may occur due to increased uric acid
production (eg, dietary sources of purine) or reduced uric acid clearance. Most diuretics (eg,
hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) can cause hyperuricemia and trigger gout flares by causing
relative volume depletion, which decreases the fractional excretion of uric acid. Other
medications that can cause hyperuricemia include certain immunosuppressants (eg,
cyclosporine, tacrolimus) and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. In addition, medications that
rapidly lower uric acid levels (eg, allopurinol) can paradoxically trigger an acute attack of gout
due to mobilization of tissue urate stores (ie, dissolving crystals become fragile and more
easily shed into the joint space).

(Choices A and B) The lipid-lowering medication most prominently associated with gout is
niacin, which decreases renal excretion of uric acid. Statins (eg, atorvastatin) can cause
hepatitis and myalgias, and fibrates (eg, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate) can cause severe myopathy
when given with statins; fibrates also increase the risk of cholesterol gallstones.
