HLA-B27 = human leukocyte antigen B27; TNF-a = tumor necrosis factor-alpha; CRP = C-

reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

This patient with inflammatory back pain (ie, age <40, insidious onset, worse with rest/better
with activity) and enthesitis (ie, tenderness at insertion of tendons/ligaments on bone) most
likely has ankylosing spondylitis (AS). AS is characterized by bridging syndesmophytes in
the vertebral column and ankylosis (bony fusion) of the apophyseal and sacroiliac joints.

AS is an inflammatory disorder thought to originate largely in the gut:

¢ Defects in the mucosal barrier and an abnormal intestinal microbiome induce an IL-17—
mediated inflammatory response via innate lymphoid cells and T helper cells (eg, Th1,
Th17). The risk is greater in individuals with human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27),
likely due to altered antigen presentation.

e IL-17 stimulates production of additional inflammatory factors, primarily tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and prostaglandins, which have synergistic effects with IL-17
and induce bony erosions and abnormal bone regrowth.

Skeletal manifestations of AS occur primarily at sites of mechanical stress, such as the
entheses, likely due to the migration of activated immune cells to these areas. Treatment
