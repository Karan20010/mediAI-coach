Causes of gout

¢ Primary gout (idiopathic)
Increased e Myeloproliferative/lymphoproliferative disorders
urate production|« Tumor lysis syndrome
¢ Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency

Decreased ¢ Chronic kidney disease

urate clearance | Thiazide/loop diuretics

This patient, with recurrent acute monoarthritis and history of a myeloproliferative disorder, has

typical features of gout. Gout occurs when there is an increased uric acid concentration in
serum and synovial fluid, leading to monosodium urate crystal formation and deposition in
synovium and cartilage. Gout is most common in joints where cooler temperatures favor
crystal formation, especially in the distal lower extremity (eg, first metatarsophalangeal joint,
ankle, knee). Uptake of urate crystals by neutrophils leads to free radical release, cytokine
production, and joint inflammation. The hyperuricemia that predisposes to gout can be
idiopathic (primary gout) or due to increased urate production (eg, myeloproliferative disorders)
or decreased urate clearance by the kidneys.
