This patient, a middle-aged woman with polyarthritis, morning stiffness, and systemic
symptoms, has typical features of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methotrexate is the preferred
first-line disease-modifying treatment for most patients with moderate to severe RA.
Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite that halts purine and pyrimidine synthesis through
competitive inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase.

Methotrexate preferentially inhibits growth of rapidly dividing cells, such as inflammatory and
neoplastic cells. However, this inhibitory effect also causes toxicity to tissues with rapid
cellular turnover, such as oral and gastrointestinal mucosa (ulcerations), hair follicles
(alopecia), and bone marrow (pancytopenia). Methotrexate can also cause hepatotoxicity
(hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis) and pulmonary fibrosis.

(Choice A) Hydroxychloroquine is a well-tolerated antirheumatic drug used in mild RA and
systemic lupus erythematosus. Its most significant toxicity is irreversible retinopathy, and
patients should have regular ophthalmologic examinations.

(Choice C) Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with weak antirheumatic activity. Common
side effects include photosensitivity dermatitis.
