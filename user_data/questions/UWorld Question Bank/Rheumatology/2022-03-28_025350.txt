The arrow points to a bilaterally symmetric structure that lies in close association to the
vertebral body and vertebral transverse process. This is the psoas muscle, which originates
from the anterior surface of the transverse processes and lateral surface of the vertebral
bodies at T12-L5. Inferiorly (at around the level of the inguinal ligament), the psoas muscle
combines with the iliacus muscle (Choice B) to form the iliopsoas muscle, which functions in
hip flexion and contributes to external rotation of the thigh.

Psoas abscess can develop due to hematogenous seeding from a distal site (primary
abscess) or contiguous spread of infection from adjacent structures such as the vertebra
(secondary abscess). Patients often present subacutely with abdominal/flank pain, fever, and
inguinal mass. HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for
primary psoas abscess development.

(Choice A) The erector spinae is a large muscle group of the back that courses longitudinally
along the spinous processes. Bilateral contraction causes spine extension.

(Choice C) The ligamenta flava are paired elastic ligaments that connect the vertebral
laminae. The ligamenta flava form the posterior wall of the spinal canal and help stabilize the

spine.

(Choice E) The transversus abdominis (transversalis) muscle is the most internal of the
