Question Id: 859

Explanation

The preferred first-line treatment for acute gouty arthritis is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug, but these are contraindicated in patients with a recent history of peptic ulcer. Other
treatment options include colchicine and oral or intraarticular glucocorticoids.

Colchicine binds to the intracellular protein tubulin and inhibits its polymerization into
microtubules. This, in turn, disrupts cytoskeletal-dependent functions such as chemotaxis and
phagocytosis. Colchicine is administered initially at the first signs of a gout flare and can be
repeated an hour later. It may also be used for prophylaxis while initiating urate-lowering
therapy (eg, allopurinol). Important adverse effects of colchicine include nausea, abdominal
pain, and diarrhea, which are most common at higher doses. Colchicine should be avoided in
patients who are elderly or have severe renal dysfunction.

Educational objective:

Colchicine inhibits tubulin polymerization into microtubules and can be used for acute
treatment and prophylaxis of gout. Important side effects of colchicine include nausea,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea.
