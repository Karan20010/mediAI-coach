This patient suffered a fracture of the proximal humerus at the anatomical neck. Humeral
neck fractures commonly occur in falls; risk factors include age >65 and osteoporosis. They
often occur as isolated injuries but may also be associated with glenohumeral dislocation.

The proximal humerus and glenohumeral joint receive their blood supply via the anterior and
posterior circumflex humeral arteries, which are branches of the axillary artery that form an
anastomosis encircling the neck of the humerus in the quadrangular space. This anastomosis
gives rise to intraosseous arteries that travel back to the humeral head; humeral neck fractures
can disrupt this retrograde blood flow, leading to avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the
humeral head. Osteonecrosis presents insidiously with shoulder pain, decreased range of
motion, and flattening of the humeral head on x-ray.

(Choice A) Biceps tendon rupture presents with weakness of shoulder flexion and a
noticeable bulge in the anterior arm. It most commonly occurs due to chronic overuse
tendinopathy or acute forceful contraction of the biceps, but humeral neck fracture does not
usually disrupt the tendon.

(Choices B and D) Supracondylar fracture may injure the brachial artery and median nerve
where they pass anterior to the distal humerus. These structures are not at risk from proximal
