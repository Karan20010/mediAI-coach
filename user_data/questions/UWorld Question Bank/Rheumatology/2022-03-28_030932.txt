(Choice C) Oral or intraarticular glucocorticoids can be used for acute gout in patients who
cannot tolerate NSAIDs or colchicine. However, they have significant long-term side effects.

(Choice D) Lipoxygenase inhibitors (eg, zileuton) are oral anti-inflammatory medications used
in the long-term management of asthma. They are not useful for treatment of gout.

(Choice E) Uricosuric agents (eg, probenecid) are second-line drugs for chronic management
of gout. These drugs increase renal excretion of uric acid and are therefore contraindicated in
patients with a history of renal stones.

Educational objective:

Chronic uric acid-lowering therapy is recommended for patients with gout who have frequent
gouty attacks, uric acid kidney stones, tophi, or chronic joint destruction from gout. Xanthine
oxidase inhibitors are the preferred treatment.
