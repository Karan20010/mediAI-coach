This patient has chronic knee pain associated with crepitus, which is consistent with
osteoarthritis (the most common form of arthritis). Besides the knees, osteoarthritis also
commonly affects the hips, lumbar spine, and distal joints of the hands. Patients typically have
pain that worsens with activity and is relieved by rest. Osteoarthritis typically progresses with
age and is accelerated in patients with prior joint injury or excessive mechanical stresses (eg,
obesity, joint deformities).

Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fissuring, flaking, and erosion (fibrillation) of
articular cartilage. The etiology is multifactorial, with excessive biomechanical stress and
increased intraarticular metalloproteinase activity as the major contributors to cartilage
destruction. Although a number of proinflammatory mediators (eg, IL-6, macrophage
chemotactic protein-1) have been linked to osteoarthritis, overt signs of synovitis (eg, redness,
warmth) are less prominent than in the classic inflammatory arthritic disorders (eg, gout).
Effusions, if present, are often small.

(Choice A) Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease presents with an acute inflammatory
arthritis resembling gout (ie, pseudogout). Although this disorder is common in the knee,
chronic arthritis without signs of acute synovitis is more consistent with osteoarthritis.
