Secreted by several different cell types (eg, fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils, synovial
cells, some epithelial cells), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) primarily function in the
degradation of collagen and other proteins in the extracellular matrix. MMP activity is
important in wound healing, as it encourages both myofibroblast accumulation at the wound
edges and scar tissue remodeling. The amassed myofibroblasts initiate wound contraction
during healing by second intention. Contractures may occur when unusually pronounced
MMP activity results in excessive wound contraction.

(Choice A) Wound dehiscence is the rupturing of a previously closed wound, and can result
from insufficient granulation and scar tissue formation, inadequate wound contraction, or
excessive mechanical stress. Such wound rupture most commonly occurs in abdominal
wounds that are subject to increased intraabdominal pressure, which is not the case with this
patient.

(Choice B) Ulceration of a wound typically results from inadequate vascularization during
healing and is not associated with excessive matrix metalloproteinase or myofibroblast
activity. Common sites of ulceration include lower extremity wounds in conjunction with
atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease.
