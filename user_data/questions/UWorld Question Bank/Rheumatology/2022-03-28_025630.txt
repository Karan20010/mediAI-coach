(eg, Mycobacterium marinum, Nocardia, Leishmania) can cause nodular lymphangitis, the
most likely pathogen in this case is Sporothrix schenckii.

S schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as cigar-shaped yeasts at body temperature
and reproduces by narrow-based budding. It exists as a mold in the environment and tends
to grow in decaying plant matter and soil, particularly on sphagnum moss, hay, and
decaying wood. Transmission typically occurs when the organism is introduced into cutaneous
or subcutaneous tissue while a person is farming, landscaping, or gardening.

Manifestations of infection progress slowly over days or weeks and usually begin with a
painless papule at the site of inoculation that eventually ulcerates; notably, the lesion does
not drain pus or odorous material. Similar lesions arise over several days more proximally
along the lymphatic channel. Systemic symptoms (eg, fever) do not generally occur. Most
cases can be diagnosed clinically, but culture of a sample from a lesion can definitively identify
the organism.

(Choice A) Bat guano can carry Histoplasma capsulatum, which typically causes a mild,
subacute pulmonary infection. Nodular lesions can develop as part of disseminated infection,
but lesions are usually bilateral and do not exhibit proximal spread. In addition, disseminated
infections are almost always seen in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, AIDS).
