(Choice E) Metformin slightly lowers uric acid, possibly due to changes in fatty acid
metabolism. It is not associated with a significant risk of gout.

Educational objective:

Gout occurs in the setting of hyperuricemia and causes an inflammatory arthritis characterized
by negative birefringent, needle-shaped crystals visible on joint fluid microscopy. Most
diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide) can cause hyperuricemia and trigger gout flares
by causing relative volume depletion, which decreases the fractional excretion of uric acid.
