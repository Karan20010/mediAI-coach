An 18-year-old man, who was recently started on risperidone therapy for schizophrenia,
comes to the office due to involuntary deviation of his head. On examination, the patient's
head is tilted toward the right side and the chin is rotated to the left. There is palpable
tightening of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. It is determined that the patient is
experiencing a medication-induced dystonic reaction due to motor neuron hyperactivity. The

persistent myocyte stimulation causes a substance to be released from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum. This substance most likely binds to which of the following proteins to cause this

patient's symptoms?

© A. Actin

©, B. Myosin

(©) C. Tropomyosin
© D. Troponin

©) E. Protein kinase A
