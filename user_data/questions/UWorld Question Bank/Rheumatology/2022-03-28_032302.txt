fracturing) and erosion of articular cartilage due to increased biomechanical stress.
Periarticular findings include osteophyte formation and subchondral sclerosis due to extensive
bone remodelling. In contrast, RA is more frequently associated with periarticular bone

erosions.

(Choice B) Late-stage RA is characterized by widespread joint deformities. Characteristic
findings include ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints, swan-neck deformities
(hyperextension at the proximal interphalangeal joints with flexion at the distal interphalangeal
joints) in the digits, and additional deformities (eg, volar subluxation of the carpus, radial drift)
at the wrists.

Educational objective:

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial hyperplasia with inflammatory infiltrates. The
accelerated metabolic rate of the inflamed synovium causes local hypoxia, which leads to
synovial angiogenesis. As the disease progresses, the joint space is replaced by a rheumatoid
pannus (an invasive mass of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory
cells) which can destroy the articular cartilage and underlying subchondral bone.
