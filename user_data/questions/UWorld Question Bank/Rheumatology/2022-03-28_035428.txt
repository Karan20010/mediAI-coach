The sciatic nerve branches into the common peroneal (fibular) nerve and the tibial nerve
posteriorly in the thigh just proximal to the popliteal fossa. After coursing around the neck of
the fibula, the common peroneal nerve divides into superficial and deep branches. The
superficial branch innervates the muscles of the lateral compartment of the leg, which function
primarily to evert the foot. The deep peroneal nerve innervates the anterior compartment of
the leg, whose muscles act mainly as dorsiflexors of the foot and toes. The superficial
peroneal nerve provides sensory innervation to the dorsum of the foot. The deep peroneal
nerve provides sensory innervation to the region between the first and second digits of the
foot.

This patient has a fracture of the neck of the fibula. The common peroneal nerve is the most
frequently injured nerve in the leg due to its superficial location as it courses laterally around
the neck of the fibula. Injury to the common peroneal nerve from a proximal fibula fracture
would cause loss of dorsal foot sensation as well as impaired dorsiflexion and eversion
resulting in foot drop.

(Choice A) The tibialis posterior (innervated by tibial nerve) is the major muscle involved in

foot inversion. The tibialis anterior (innervated by common peroneal nerve) is less important,
and patients with peroneal nerve injuries usually have normal foot inversion.
