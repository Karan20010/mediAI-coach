Educational objective:

Colchicine is a second-line agent for treating acute gouty arthritis. It inhibits tubulin
polymerization and microtubule formation in leukocytes, reducing neutrophil chemotaxis and
emigration to sites inflamed by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals.
Gastrointestinal mucosal function is also impaired by microtubule disruption, leading to
diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
