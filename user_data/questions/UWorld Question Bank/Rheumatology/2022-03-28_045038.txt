findings

This patient's recurring skin and mucosal infections, as well as the absence of purulence, are
highly suggestive of leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). LAD is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by the absence of CD18 antigens, which are necessary for the
formation of integrins. Integrins are essential for leukocyte adhesion to endothelial surfaces
and migration into peripheral tissues in response to infection or inflammation.

The failure of leukocyte chemotaxis results in characteristic LAD findings, including recurrent
skin and mucosal infections (often due to Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative rods)
