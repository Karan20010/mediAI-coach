branch of the median nerve that supplies most of the deep volar forearm muscles. The
anterior interosseous nerve and artery originate in the forearm, distal to the cubital fossa.

(Choice C) The deep brachial artery is the first branch off the brachial artery in the upper
arm. It courses posterior to the humerus and is vulnerable to injury with humeral shaft
fractures.

(Choices D and E) Shortly after originating from the brachial artery in the forearm, the radial
artery gives off the radial recurrent artery, which ascends in proximity to the radial nerve near
the /ateral epicondyle. The radial artery then accompanies the superficial branch of the radial
nerve through most of the forearm. The absence of radial nerve deficits and laceration
location (cubital fossa near medial epicondyle) make injury to these vessels unlikely.

(Choice F) The ulnar artery originates from the brachial artery in the forearm (distal to the
medial epicondyle). It runs alongside the ulnar nerve through most of the forearm.

Educational objective:

The brachial artery runs alongside the median and ulnar nerves in the medial bicipital groove
of the upper arm. Proximal to the elbow, the median and ulnar nerves diverge, and the
brachial artery ¢ continues with the median nerve through the cubital fossa. Injury to the median
