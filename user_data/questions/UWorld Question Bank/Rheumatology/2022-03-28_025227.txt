(Choice E) Internal rotation of the humerus is accomplished by the subscapularis muscle,
which originates in the subscapular fossa and inserts on the lesser tubercle of the head of the
humerus with contribution from the teres major, pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, and
latissimus dorsi.

Educational objective:

The most commonly injured structure in rotator cuff syndrome is the tendon of the
supraspinatus muscle. Because the supraspinatus is an abductor of the humerus, injury to its
tendon causes pain on abduction of the arm.
