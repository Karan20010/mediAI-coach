organ transplantation, particularly renal transplantation. This medication impairs renal
excretion of uric acid, resulting in hyperuricemia. Although high doses of systemic
glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) can be used to treat acute gout, the low doses used for
immunosuppression in patients who have undergone transplantation are usually not sufficient
to prevent gout flares.

(Choice B) Increased production of uric acid is commonly due to a purine-rich diet (eg, red
meat, seafood), excessive alcohol intake, fructose-sweetened beverage intake, or disorders
associated with increased cell turnover (eg, myeloproliferative disorders, cancers).

(Choice C) Urate-lowering agents (eg, allopurinol) are used to prevent recurrent gout but can
occasionally precipitate a gout flare due to rapid declines in blood uric acid levels, which can
disrupt preexisting crystal deposits and increase their immunogenicity. This patient is not
taking a medication that lowers uric acid levels.

(Choice D) Patients who have malignancy associated with high tumor burdens (eg, acute
lymphoblastic leukemia) can develop tumor lysis syndrome when cytotoxic chemotherapy is
initiated. The massive release of nucleic acids into the circulation (from lysed cells) increases
serum uric acid levels (due to catabolism of purine nucleic acids) and can precipitate gout.

Choice E) Diuretics (eg, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide) can be associated with gout as
