Denosumab

Binds RANK-L & inhibits binding to RANK
Reduces differentiation & survival of osteoclasts

Recombinant PTH analog
(teriparatide)

Stimulates maturation of preosteoblasts into bone-
forming osteoblasts

tubular calcium reabsorption

hormone.

RANK = receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B; RANK-L = RANK ligand; PTH = parathyroid
