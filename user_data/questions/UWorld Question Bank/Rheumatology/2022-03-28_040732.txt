Although this patient believes her back pain may be due to a muscle sprain, her presentation
(localized bony back pain, low-grade fever, recent staphylococcal bacteremia) suggests
vertebral osteomyelitis. Bacteria can access the spine by hematogenous spread from a
distant infection (eg, skin or soft tissue, intravenous catheter), direct invasion from trauma or
local spinal procedures (eg, lumbar puncture, spinal surgery), or direct spread from adjacent
soft tissue infection. Hematogenous spread is most common as the adult vertebral bone has
a very rich and vascular marrow. Increasing age can cause the nutrient arteries to develop a
"corkscrew" anatomy, which allows bacteria to more easily penetrate the marrow cavity and
cause local infection.

Bacteremia due to intravascular devices (eg, hemodialysis catheters) increases risk of health
care-related vertebral osteomyelitis. Offending organisms include Staphylococcus (most
common is S aureus or coagulase-negative staphylococci) and various gram-negative
organisms (eg, Pseudomonas). Vertebral osteomyelitis should be suspected in patients with
new or worsening back pain, fever, and recent endocarditis or bacteremia (especially S
aureus). |t should also be suspected if there are new neurologic findings and fever, with or
without back pain. Initial evaluation includes blood cultures and MRI of the spine, which is
the most sensitive imaging method for diagnosing vertebral osteomyelitis.
