Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeasts at body temperature. Itis
found in decaying plant matter and soil and is usually transmitted via cutaneous or
subcutaneous inoculation while a person is farming, gardening, or landscaping. The major
manifestation is a slowly progressive nonpurulent, nonpainful, nodular lymphangitis that
progresses proximally along the lymphatic chain.
