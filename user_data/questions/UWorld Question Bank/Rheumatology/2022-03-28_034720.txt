This patient's x-ray shows a right femoral neck fracture, which is common in elderly patients
with osteoporosis who have fallen. Femoral neck fractures, especially when displaced, put the
femoral head at risk for osteonecrosis if its blood supply is disrupted. The blood supply to the
femoral head derives mainly from the ascending cervical and retinacular branches of the
medial circumflex femoral artery. These vessels are especially vulnerable to damage from
fractures of the femoral neck due to their close association with it.

(Choice A) The deep femoral artery gives rise to the medial and lateral circumflex femoral
arteries. However, injury to the deep femoral artery is less likely because it is remote from the
femoral neck.

(Choices B and C) Branches of the lateral circumflex femoral and superior and inferior gluteal
arteries join with the medial circumflex femoral artery to form the trochanteric anastomosis.
However, these arteries provide only minor contributions to the blood supply of the femoral
head and neck.

(Choice E) The obturator artery gives rise to the artery of the ligamentum teres, which
supplies a minor portion of the femoral head. This vessel is important in children because it
supplies the region of the femoral head proximal to the epiphyseal growth plate, but it is of
minimal clinical significance in adults.
