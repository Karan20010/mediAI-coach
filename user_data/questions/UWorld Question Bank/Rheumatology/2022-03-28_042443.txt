Muscular dystrophy is a term that applies to the various diseases that manifest with
progressive muscular weakness. Deletions of the dystrophin gene that encodes the
dystrophin protein on X chromosome p21 are the most common mutation in Duchenne
muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD). Deletions that are not a
multiple of 3 change the reading frame, causing a frameshift mutation, which results in a
nonfunctional protein and severe clinical manifestations (DMD). In contrast, deletions that are
a multiple of 3 base pairs preserve the reading frame, resulting in a truncated but functional
protein and a milder clinical phenotype (BMD).

Dystrophin is a structural component of skeletal muscle fibers that provides mechanical
stability to the sarcolemma. It links a component of the cytoskeleton (actin) to
transmembrane proteins (a- and B-dystrophiglycans) that are connected to the extracellular
matrix. Loss of dystrophin results in cellular injury (myonecrosis). On light microscopy, there
is segmental degeneration and regeneration of the myofibers with marked variation in size
(both atrophic and hypertrophic fibers). Over time, the muscle tissue undergoes progressive
fatty replacement.

On clinical examination, the presence of Gowers sign and calf enlargement in a boy age 2-5
is classic for DMD. Calf hypertrophy allows affected children to overcome proximal muscle
