In the purine degradation pathway, purine bases (ie, hypoxanthine, guanine) can follow 1 of 2
routes:

¢ Approximately 10% are converted by xanthine oxidase to uric acid, which is released into
the bloodstream and excreted in the urine.

¢ The other 90% are recycled into purine nucleotides by hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) to be reused in the formation of DNA and RNA (ie,
purine salvage).

Gout occurs due to elevated serum uric acid levels, leading to the formation of inflammation-
inducing uric acid crystals within joints (eg, metatarsals). Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg,
allopurinol, febuxostat) treat gout by reducing uric acid levels and in the process shunt
additional purine bases toward the salvage route.

Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug that is metabolized via the purine degradation
pathway. Following ingestion, azathioprine is converted to 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), which is
a false purine base that, like hypoxanthine and guanine, can follow 1 of 2 routes. Some 6-MP
is converted by xanthine oxidase (or thiopurine methyltransferase) into inactive metabolites
that are excreted in the urine. The remainder is converted by HGPRT into active metabolites
