(Choice C) The peroneal veins accompany the peroneal artery and drain blood from the
lateral compartment into the deep posterior compartment and eventually into the posterior
tibial veins.

(Choices D and F) The deep posterior compartment contains the posterior tibial artery,
peroneal artery, and tibial nerve. ACS involving this compartment may cause decreased
sensation in the plantar surface, decreased toe flexion, and pain with passive toe extension.

(Choice E) The lateral compartment of the leg contains the superficial peroneal nerve and the
proximal part of the deep peroneal nerve. ACS in this compartment can produce loss of
sensation in the lower leg and dorsum of the foot as well as foot drop.

Educational objective:

Acute compartment syndrome (ACS) is caused by increased pressure within fascial
compartments of the limbs, leading to impaired perfusion. ACS can cause severe pain,
myonecrosis, and nerve injury. The anterior compartment of the leg, which contains the deep
peroneal (fibular) nerve, is the most common site of ACS.
