Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator that has strong estrogen antagonist
activity in the breast and is used in the treatment of estrogen receptor—positive breast cancer.
It has estrogen-like effects on bone and can reduce the risk of osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women. However, its agonist activity on the uterus increases the risk of
endometrial hyperplasia/cancer and it is not appropriate for routine use in osteoporosis
(Choice F).

(Choice A) Bisphosphonates (eg, alendronate) inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
They have no estrogen agonist or antagonist activity and do not lower the risk of breast

cancer.

(Choice C) Leuprolide is a GnRH analog that stimulates FSH and LH release (and
subsequent estrogen production) when administered in a pulsatile manner (eg, via a
programmable pump for treatment of anovulation) but suppresses release when administered
continuously (eg, for endometriosis). Continuous use may reduce breast cancer risk but is
associated with accelerated bone loss.

(Choice D) Medroxyprogesterone reduces the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and
endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy, but

otherwise has no benefit in management of osteoporosis. In addition, long-term use of
