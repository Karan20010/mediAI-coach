The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) originates on the lateral femoral condyle and courses
anteriorly and medially to insert on the anterior intercondylar area of the tibia. The primary
function of the ACL is to prevent anterior motion of the tibia with respect to the femur,
although it also plays a role in stabilizing the knee against rotatory and varus/valgus forces.

The ACL is most commonly ruptured in noncontact sports that involve sudden changes in
direction or excessive internal rotation or lateral (valgus) bending forces when landing from a
jump. The middle geniculate artery provides the primary blood supply to the ACL, and injuries
are characterized by rapid-onset hemarthrosis and knee swelling. In addition to the effusion,
examination typically shows anterior laxity of the tibia relative to the femur (eg, Lachman test,
anterior drawer test).

(Choices B and F) The tibial (medial) collateral ligament is most commonly injured by
impacts to the lateral knee. The fibular (lateral) collateral ligament is only rarely injured but
may be injured by a forceful blow to the medial knee while the leg is extended. Injury to these
ligaments is characterized by laxity of valgus or varus stress, respectively.

(Choice C) The oblique popliteal ligament is a wide, fibrous band that connects the posterior
distal femur to the posterior proximal tibia. It has small openings for nerves, vessels, and

muscle insertions. Injury would allow laxity of knee hyperextension.
