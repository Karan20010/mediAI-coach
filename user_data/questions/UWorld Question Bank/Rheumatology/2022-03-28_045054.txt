and periodontal disease. LAD-related infections are notable for lack of purulence because of

the absence of leukocytes in peripheral tissues. Wound healing is also impaired, which can

result in late umbilical cord separation (age >3 weeks).

Peripheral leukocytosis and neutrophilia are typical, particularly during active infection,
because leukocytes cannot migrate out of the blood vessels.

(Choice A) Deficiencies of T-cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV, severe combined
immunodeficiency) increase the risk of infection following live vaccines. T-cell deficiencies
present with severe opportunistic infections in early infancy but have normal CD18 antigens.

(Choice B) Terminal complement deficiency (C5b-CQ) results in an inability to form the
membrane attack complex and predisposes to recurrent Neisseria infections. CD18 is not
affected by this condition, and Neisseria infections are not common in LAD.

(Choice D) The absence of B lymphocytes in X-linked agammaglobulinemia leads to
hypoplasia of lymphoid tissue (eg, tonsils, lymph nodes). Patients have recurrent
sinopulmonary infections, but nonpurulent skin infections and absence of CD18 are
inconsistent with the diagnosis.

(Choice E) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by the triad of
