Educational objective:

Vitamin D deficiency decreases intestinal absorption of calcium. Parathyroid hormone
secretion increases to maintain plasma calcium, which causes renal phosphate wasting and
impaired bone mineralization. In children, this causes rickets characterized by excessive
unmineralized osteoid matrix at the epiphyseal cartilage.
