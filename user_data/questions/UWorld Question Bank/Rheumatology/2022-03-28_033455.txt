Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors are large-molecule anti-inflammatory agents
("biologics") commonly used to treat moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, particularly in
patients who have failed methotrexate therapy. Etanercept is a fusion protein with domains
derived from the Fc portion of lgG1 and TNF receptor 2. It functions as a decoy receptor for
TNF-a. Other TNF-a inhibitors are anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies (eg, infliximab,
adalimumab).

Inhibition of TNF-a leads to impaired cell-mediated immunity. In particular, TNF-a is necessary
for effective sequestration of mycobacteria within granulomas. As a result, TNF-a inhibitors
promote reactivation of latent tuberculosis and can increase the risk of disseminated disease.
All patients being considered for TNF-a inhibitor therapy should have a baseline tuberculin skin
test or interferon-gamma release assay to screen for latent tuberculosis. TNF-a inhibitors also
increase susceptibility to other infectious agents, including fungi and atypical mycobacteria,
and should not be used in any patient with an underlying infection.

(Choice A) CT is effective in diagnosing a variety of infections of the central nervous system,
including disseminated tuberculosis. However, a baseline CT scan is not needed in
rheumatoid arthritis in the absence of suspicious symptoms.

(Choice B) Baseline assessment of left ventricular function with echocardiogram or
