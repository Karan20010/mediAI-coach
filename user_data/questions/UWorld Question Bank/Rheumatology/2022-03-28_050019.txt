(Choice C) Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) indicated for
treatment of depression and generalized anxiety disorder. SSRIs are associated with a small
decrease in bone density; their effect on fracture risk has not been well studied.

(Choice D) Furosemide is a loop diuretic used to treat congestive heart failure (CHF). It
causes an increase in urinary calcium loss that may worsen osteoporosis.

(Choice F) Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat gastroesophageal
reflux and peptic ulcer. PPls inhibit the enzyme H-K-ATPase on gastric parietal cells and
reduce gastric acid secretion. PPIs also decrease calcium and magnesium absorption, and
long-term use is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis.

(Choice G) Metformin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin sensitivity
and peripheral glucose uptake. It has no significant effect on osteoporosis risk.

(Choice H) Spironolactone is an aldosterone inhibitor used to treat CHF. Spironolactone can
cause hyperkalemia, but it does not have a significant effect on calcium homeostasis.

Educational objective:
Thiazide diuretics increase calcium absorption in the distal convoluted tubules within the
