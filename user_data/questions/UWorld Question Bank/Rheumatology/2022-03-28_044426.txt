Patients typically develop progressive proximal muscle weakness that manifests in the form
of gait alteration and difficulty arising from a chair or climbing stairs. Autonomic symptoms,
such as dry mouth or impotence, are common. Cranial nerve (particularly ptosis) and
respiratory muscle involvement may occur but typically manifest later in the disease course.
Patients may experience postexercise facilitation, in which muscle strength and deep tendon
reflexes improve with exercise or repetitive movements (due to accumulation of calcium within
the axon terminal). This effect is also seen in repetitive nerve stimulation studies.

(Choice A) Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute postinfectious polyneuropathy often
associated with Campylobacter jejuni infections. It is characterized by rapidly progressive,
ascending paralysis that does not improve with repetitive movement.

(Choice B) Paraneoplastic syndromes associated with gastric adenocarcinoma include abrupt
onset of numerous seborrheic keratoses (Leser-Trélat sign) and acanthosis nigricans.

(Choice C) Giant cell arteritis is characterized by headache, visual changes, and jaw
claudication in older adults. It is not associated with LEMS.

(Choice D) Medullary thyroid cancer may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) type 2 (both A and B variants). MEN 2A is associated with pheochromocytoma and
