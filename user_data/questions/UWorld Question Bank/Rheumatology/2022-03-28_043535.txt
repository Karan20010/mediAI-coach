polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which presents with achy pain in the proximal skeletal
muscles (eg, shoulders, hips).

Ocular manifestations are common in GCA and can lead to irreversible vision loss. AION is
due to involvement of the ciliary arteries and causes a painless, rapidly progressive decrease
in visual acuity. GCA can also cause visual symptoms due to central retinal artery occlusion,
extraocular palsies, and infarcts of the visual cortex. Transient monocular vision loss
(amaurosis fugax) may also be seen.

Treatment for GCA and PMR includes systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone,
methylprednisolone). However, for patients with suspected GCA, treatment should be started
prior to diagnostic testing (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, temporal artery biopsy) because
of the risk of blindness if treatment is delayed.

(Choice A) Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor/diuretic used for treating
idiopathic intracranial hypertension (ie, chronic headache and vision loss; occurs mainly in
young, obese women) and angle-closure glaucoma (ie, eye pain, redness, middilated pupil,
and cloudy cornea). Neither condition is associated with proximal muscle pain.

(Choice B) Antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) are indicated for patients with
