Educational objective:

The greater trochanter of the femur serves as the site of insertion for the gluteus medius
muscle, which is responsible for hip abduction and stabilization of the pelvis during
ambulation. Fractures of the greater trochanter (eg, fragility fracture from a fall) can disrupt the
integrity of the gluteus medius tendon and result in lateral hip pain with gait instability and

weakness of hip abduction.
