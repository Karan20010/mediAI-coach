This patient's clinical findings (constitutional symptoms, arthralgias, and pleuritic chest pain),
anti-histone antibodies, and recent isoniazid use support the diagnosis of drug-induced
lupus erythematosus (DILE). Unlike classic lupus, DILE typically lacks the usual cutaneous
manifestations (eg, malar rash) and is rarely associated with neurologic or renal
complications. Clinical improvement is rapid on discontinuation of the causative agent.

Procainamide, hydralazine, and isoniazid are metabolized via phase || acetylation in the
liver. Hepatic expression of N-acetyltransferase is genetically determined, and patients with a
slow acetylator phenotype are at greater risk of developing DILE. Patients who are slow
acetylators are also predisposed to isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy due to increased
drug concentrations.

(Choice B) Liver hydrolysis is a phase | reaction in which a compound is cleaved by adding
water (eg, esterase or amidase enzymes). Phase | metabolism usually precedes phase II
conjugation metabolism.

(Choice C) Liver hydroxylation is a phase | oxidation transformation catalyzed by the
cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system. Addition of a hydroxyl group reduces lipid
solubility and facilitates excretion.
