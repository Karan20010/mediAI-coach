anaerobic environment necessary for vegetative bacterial prolireration.

C perfringens classically causes gas gangrene (eg, necrosis, gas in tissue) within hours of
infection. This is primarily mediated by the generation of alpha toxin (lecithinase), a potent
phospholipase C mimetic that splits host phospholipids. This compound hydrolyzes
lecithin-containing lipoprotein complexes in cell membranes, which causes cell lysis, tissue
necrosis, and edema. It also mediates intravascular aggregations of platelets, neutrophils, and
fibrin, which results in vascular occlusion and further promotes the anaerobic environment
required for bacterial proliferation. Although C perfringens produces a vast array of other
cytotoxins, alpha toxin is thought to mediate its most devastating effects.

C perfringens uses carbohydrates for energy; its rapid metabolism of muscle tissue
carbohydrates produces significant amounts of gas, which can be seen on plain radiographs
or CT scans (Choice B).

(Choice A) Actin depolymerization is mediated by Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile
cytotoxin B, which primarily causes infectious diarrhea.

(Choice C) Inactivation of elongation factor 2 through ribosylation is the mechanism of action
for diphtheria toxin. Cutaneous diphtheria is generally marked by nonhealing ulcers; it does
not typically cause rapid-onset necrosis and gas formation.
