Educational objective:

Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG that binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
Antidrug antibodies can develop against adalimumab (or other immunoglobulin-based anti-
TNF agents) that can block its interaction with TNF-alpha, preventing the drug from functioning

and leading to more rapid drug clearance.
