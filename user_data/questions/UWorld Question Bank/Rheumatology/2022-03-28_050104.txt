(Choice B) Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are synthesized by various tissues,
including the liver and bone. IGF-I increases osteoblastic replication and collagen synthesis; it
also decreases collagen degradation by inhibiting the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-13
(MMP-13). The net effect of IGF-I on the bone is anabolic.

(Choice E) Transforming growth factor beta increases the replication of osteoblast precursors,
leading to increased formation of mature osteoblasts. Transforming growth factor beta also
increases collagen synthesis and decreases bone resorption by increasing osteoclastic
apoptosis.

Educational objective:

Osteoclasts originate from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Macrophage colony-stimulating
factor and receptor for activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L) play an important role
in osteoclast differentiation. Paget's disease of bone is characterized by increased numbers of
abnormal osteoclasts, excessive bone turnover and disorganized bone remodeling.
