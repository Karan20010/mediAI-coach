This patient has olecranon bursitis with localized swelling over the posterior elbow. The
olecranon bursa is a fluid-filled synovial sac between the olecranon process and the skin that
alleviates friction at the bony prominence. Repetitive pressure or overuse (eg, upper
extremity exercise) can injure the bursa, leading to synovial fluid accumulation within it.
Bursitis due to overuse is noninflammatory; associated discomfort is typically mild. However,
inflammatory bursitis (eg, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, infection) can present with significant
erythema and pain.

Because the bursa is not an intraarticular structure, bursitis typically does not interfere with
joint range of motion (ie, there is normal, pain-free range of motion) unless it is significantly
enlarged or inflamed. In contrast, intraarticular pathologies (eg, septic arthritis, intraarticular
fracture) that involve the capsule, synovium, or bone impair range of motion due to joint
effusion and pain; diffuse joint swelling (not localized bursal swelling) is typically present
(Choices B and C).

(Choice A) The annular ligament encircles the radial head and holds it and the ulna together.
In children, ligamental laxity can predispose to radial head subluxation (ie, nursemaid elbow)
when axial traction is applied to the arm. Affected patients have mild tenderness in the
anterolateral elbow (radial head) that is worsened by forearm supination. Swelling is not seen.
