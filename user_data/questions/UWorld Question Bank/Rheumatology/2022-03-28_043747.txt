(Choice B) Hypertrophy of muscle fibers may occur in the early stages of DMD. However,
fibrofatty change of the enlarged muscles would be expected in a patient at this advanced
stage of the disease.

(Choice C) Lipid accumulation within muscle fibers is seen in lipid myopathies such as
carnitine palmitoyltransferase deficiency.

(Choice D) Prominent inflammatory infiltrate is a characteristic histologic feature of
polymyositis and dermatomyositis. These conditions cause proximal muscle weakness
without distal pseudohypertrophy.

(Choice E) Ragged red fibers refer to muscle fibers with irregular contours and a blotchy red

appearance. They are seen in mitochondrial myopathies.

Educational objective:
Duchenne muscle dystrophy manifests with proximal muscle weakness and atrophy. True

hypertrophy of the distal muscle is noted early in the disease as distal muscles compensate for

weak proximal ones. Muscle fibers of the distal extremities are later replaced by fat and
connective tissue (pseudohypertrophy).
