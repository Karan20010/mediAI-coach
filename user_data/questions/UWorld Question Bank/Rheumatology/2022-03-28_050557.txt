(Choice C) Leuprolide is a GnRH analog that stimulates FSH and LH release (and
subsequent estrogen production) when administered in a pulsatile manner (eg, via a
programmable pump for treatment of anovulation) but suppresses release when administered
continuously (eg, for endometriosis). Continuous use may reduce breast cancer risk but is
associated with accelerated bone loss.

(Choice D) Medroxyprogesterone reduces the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia and
endometrial carcinoma in postmenopausal women on estrogen replacement therapy, but
otherwise has no benefit in management of osteoporosis. In addition, long-term use of
medroxyprogesterone alone is associated with increased bone loss.

Educational objective:

Selective estrogen receptor modulators exhibit estrogen antagonist and agonist properties in a
tissue-specific manner. Raloxifene has estrogen agonist activity on bone, which decreases
bone resorption and improves bone density. Raloxifene has an estrogen antagonist effect on
breast tissue and can decrease the risk of breast cancer; it also acts as an estrogen antagonist
in the uterus, and does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer.
