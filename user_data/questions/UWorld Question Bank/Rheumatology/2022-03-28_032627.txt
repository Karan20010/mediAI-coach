(Choice C) Colchicine binds to tubulin, which inhibits microtubule formation. This results in
impaired neutrophil mitosis and decreased neutrophil chemotaxis.

(Choice D) Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that irreversibly binds to and inhibits TNF-a, a
cytokine involved in the inflammatory response. TNF-q is an intercellular signaling protein, not

an enzyme.

(Choice E) Glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) bind to cytoplasmic receptors that then
translocate to the nucleus where the expression of anti-inflammatory peptides is upregulated.
Glucocorticoids decrease COX-2 transcription but do not bind to COX-2 directly.

Educational objective:

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible enzyme upregulated during inflammation by
interleukin-1 and TNF-a. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib) decrease inflammation by
inhibiting COX-2 production of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites. Because they
do not affect COX-1, they have minimal gastroduodenal toxicity.
