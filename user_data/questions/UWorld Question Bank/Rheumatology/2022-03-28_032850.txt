bone and soft tissue enlargement in the distal extieniitios’ Manifestations of HOA include
clubbing (enlargement of the distal phalanges with flattening of the nail fold), painful
arthropathy, periostosis (tender thickening of the periosteum) of long bones, and joint

effusions.

HOA commonly occurs in the setting of pulmonary malignancy, primarily adenocarcinoma,
which characteristically arises in the lung periphery and is the most common primary lung
cancer in nonsmokers. HOA can also occur with lung metastasis, certain nonmalignant lung
disorders (eg, cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis), and cyanotic heart disease.

Under normal conditions, megakaryocytes released from the bone marrow migrate to the
pulmonary circulation, where fragmentation releases platelets into the bloodstream. However,
in HOA, disruption of the normal pulmonary circulation leads to arteriovenous shunting and
allows megakaryocytes to bypass the lungs into the systemic circulation. Upon lodging in the
peripheral tissues (eg, distal digital bone), they release platelet-derived growth factor and
vascular endothelial growth factor, leading to fibrovascular hyperplasia and abnormal bone

formation.

(Choice B) Avascular necrosis (AVN) of bone is characterized by degeneration of cortical
bone due to loss of arterial circulation. It usually occurs in locations that have limited or
