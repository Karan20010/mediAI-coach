Urethritis, conjunctivitis, and mono- or oligoarticular arthritis constitute the classic triad of
reactive arthritis (ReA). This seronegative (rheumatoid factor-negative) spondyloarthropathy
most commonly affects patients age 20-40 and is associated with HLA-B27. Symptoms
generally manifest 1-4 weeks following a primary infection causing urethritis or enteritis and
are caused by an autoimmune reaction initiated by the infecting pathogen. Skin findings
include keratoderma blennorrhagicum (hyperkeratotic vesicles on the palms and soles) and
circinate balanitis (serpiginous annular dermatitis of the glans penis). Axial involvement,
including sacroiliitis, may occur in about 20% of cases.

(Choice A) Esophageal dysmotility is a classic finding in scleroderma although it can occur in
other conditions.

(Choice B) Hyperparathyroidism may occur in the setting of multiple endocrine neoplasia.
(Choice C) Polymyositis may occur in the setting of dermatomyositis or as a separate entity.

(Choice E) Tabes dorsalis is a manifestation of tertiary syphilis. Secondary syphilis causes
maculopapular or pustular (but not vesicular) rash that can involve the palms and soles; it is
generally associated with polyarthritis (mono-arthritis is very rare).
