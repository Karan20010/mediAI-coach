insidious-onset pain that is most pronounced in the back, pelvis, and lower extremities. The
pain is dull and increases after weight-bearing activities. The patient has no prior medical
conditions and takes no medications. He emigrated from Central Africa 5 years ago and works
overnight shifts as a cab driver. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination
shows normal muscle strength in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. A thorough
laboratory evaluation establishes the diagnosis. After discussing the likely cause of his
condition, the patient starts spending more time outdoors in the sun. Which of the following
enzymatic steps will most likely be affected by this change in activity?
