This patient's symmetric polyarthritis (involving the MCP and PIP joints) with prolonged
morning stiffness and associated fatigue is highly suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The diagnosis is made clinically, but the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-
CCP) antibodies is helpful for confirmation.

Tissue inflammation causes arginine residues in proteins such as vimentin to be
enzymatically converted into citrulline through a process called citrullination. This alters the
shape of the proteins, which can then serve as neoantigens that generate an immune
response. In RA, the immune response against citrullinated proteins is exaggerated, resulting
in high titers of anti-CCP antibodies that are not usually present in other inflammatory
conditions. Thus, anti-CCP antibodies have a high specificity for RA. Antibodies to
citrullinated peptides/proteins are usually measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using a mixture of CCPs as the antigen.

(Choice A) Anticentromere antibodies are found in the majority of patients with CREST
syndrome.

(Choice C) Antibodies to double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) are specific for systemic lupus
erythematosus.
