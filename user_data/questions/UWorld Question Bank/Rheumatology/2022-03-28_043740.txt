Deletion of the dystrophin gene causes Duchenne muscle dystrophy (DMD). The condition is
X-linked recessive and therefore affects primarily boys. Dystrophin is a structural protein of
muscle fibers, and its absence causes muscle fiber destruction (myonecrosis). Variation in
muscle fiber shape and size, regenerating fibers, and increased amounts of connective tissue
are seen on light microscopy.

Disease onset is age 2-5. Muscles of the proximal lower extremities, back, and pelvic and
shoulder girdles are affected first. Symptoms of DMD include the following:

1. Ambulation difficulties: Clumsy, slow, waddling gait; cannot keep up with peers

2. Gower sign: Progressive weakness in proximal musculature, resulting in use of the hands
to support weight on standing (as shown in the image above)

3. Calf pseudohypertrophy: Calf muscles hypertrophy initially in response to proximal
muscle weakness and are later replaced by fat and connective tissue

4. Asymmetric weakening of the paraspinal muscles, leading to kyphoscoliosis

Most patients with DMD are wheelchair bound by age 12. Scoliosis progresses rapidly due
to muscle imbalance and body positional changes. Worsening scoliosis is complicated by
restrictive pulmonary function (decreased vital capacity and total lung capacity).
