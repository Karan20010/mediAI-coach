The classic triad of reactive arthritis is nongonococcal urethritis, conjunctivitis, and arthritis. It
is an HLA-B27-associated arthropathy that occurs within several weeks following a
genitourinary or enteric infection. It belongs to the group of seronegative
spondyloarthropathies (including ankylosing spondylitis) and can cause sacroiliitis in about
20% of cases.
