(Choice B) Glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that forms insoluble complexes. This

leads to the formation of microprecipitates at the injection site that then slowly dissolve and are

released into the circulation throughout the day. Adalimumab is given as a subcutaneous

injection but does not form insoluble complexes at the i

njection site.

(Choice C) Enterohepatic recirculation of certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents (eg,

irinotecan) can lead to increased exposure of the intes

inal mucosa to the agent and significant

gastrointestinal toxicity. However, monoclonal antibodies do not undergo enterohepatic

recirculation.

(Choice D) Adalimumab and other therapeutic monocl
by degradation via receptor-mediated endocytosis in th

lonal antibodies are eliminated primarily
e reticuloendothelial system. Renal

elimination of adalimumab can lead to increased drug clearance in patients with protein-losing

glomerular disorders but otherwise does not significant

ly affect pharmacokinetics.

(Choice E) Cytochrome P-450 enzyme inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital)

can cause accelerated clearance of drugs that are metabolized primarily in the liver.

Adalimumab does not undergo metabolism by the P-450 system.

Educational objective:

Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG that binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
