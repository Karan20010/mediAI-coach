thigh. The femoral nerve also runs anterior to the hip joint; it is occasionally injured in hip
arthroplasty but is not at risk in posterior dislocation.

(Choice C) The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve passes under the inguinal ligament into the
lateral thigh; it is vulnerable to external compression but is not at risk in hip dislocation.

(Choice E) The superior gluteal artery arises from the internal iliac artery in the posterior
pelvis and can be injured in pelvic fracture. It does not approximate the hip joint and is not
vulnerable in posterior dislocation.

Educational objective:

Posterior hip dislocation (ie, femoral head displaced posteriorly from the acetabulum) can
occur in motor vehicle collisions in which the knee strikes the dashboard or from falls in elderly
patients. On examination, the leg appears shortened and internally rotated, with the hip held
in flexion and adduction. The sciatic nerve is vulnerable to injury in posterior hip dislocation.
