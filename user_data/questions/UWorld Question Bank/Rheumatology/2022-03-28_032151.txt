Symptoms/signs of ankylosing spondylitis

¢ Low back pain (onset age <40, insidious onset, improves with exercise but not with
rest, pain at night)

¢ Hip & buttock pain

¢ Limited chest expansion & spinal mobility

¢ Enthesitis (inflammation at the site of insertion of a tendon to the bone)

¢ Systemic symptoms (eg, fever, chills, fatigue, weight loss)

¢ Acute anterior uveitis (unilateral pain, photophobia, blurry vision)

The symptoms of low back pain and morning stiffness in a young man suggest ankylosing
spondylitis (AS), a chronic inflammatory condition associated with the HLA-B27 serotype. AS
is characterized by stiffness and fusion (ankylosis) of the axial joints. The sacroiliac and
apophyseal joints of the spine are the most commonly affected, leading to restricted spinal
mobility. Many patients also develop peripheral arthritis and enthesitis, which is defined as
pain, tenderness, and swelling at the sites of tendon insertion into bone (eg, Achilles tendon
insertion).

In addition, AS can cause complications in extraskeletal systems:
