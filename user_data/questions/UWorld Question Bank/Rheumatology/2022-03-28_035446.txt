and patients with peroneal nerve injuries usually have normal foot inversion.

(Choices B and E) The tibial nerve courses through the popliteal fossa and innervates the
skin of the posterior calf, lateral foot, and sole; tissues of the knee joint; and muscles providing
plantar flexion and inversion (eg, gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior). Injury to the tibial
nerve would cause weakened plantar flexion and inversion of the foot as well as decreased
sensation at the sole of the foot.

(Choice D) Loss of sensation at the medial aspect of the leg would result from a lesion of the
saphenous nerve, the largest pure sensory branch of the femoral nerve.

Educational objective:

The common peroneal nerve is vulnerable to injury where it courses around the neck of the
fibula. Fibular neck fractures can injure this nerve, causing weakness of dorsiflexion (deep
peroneal nerve) and eversion (superficial peroneal nerve) of the foot as well as loss of
sensation over the dorsum of the foot.
