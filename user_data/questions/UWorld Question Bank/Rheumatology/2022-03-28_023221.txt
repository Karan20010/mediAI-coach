concave surface found on the inner aspect of the illum. Both muscles insert via the common

iliopsoas tendon into the lesser trochanter of the femur.

(Choice A) The adductor portion of the adductor magnus originates from the inferior ramus of
the ischium and inserts into the proximal two-thirds of the posteromedial femur. It is a powerful
adductor of the thigh.

(Choice B) The long head of the biceps femoris originates from the ischial tuberosity and
inserts into the lateral head of the fibula; it functions as a thigh extensor and leg flexor.

(Choice C) The gluteus medius abducts the femur and is important in keeping the hip level
during gait when the body's weight rests on one leg.

(Choice D) The obturator externus arises from the anteromedial surface of the obturator
foramen and inserts near the greater trochanter of the femur. This muscle is a lateral rotator of
the thigh.

(Choice F) The vastus medialis is a component of the quadriceps femoris. It arises from the

functions as a knee extensor.
