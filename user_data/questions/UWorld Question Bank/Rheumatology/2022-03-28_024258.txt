Ganglion cysts are usually painless, and most patients seek medical attention because of
cosmetic concerns or fear of malignancy. However, some patients may experience mild
aching, and significant compression can occasionally result in paresthesia or weakness.
Physical examination reveals a smooth, rubbery, round structure that overlies a joint or
tendon and transilluminates with a penlight. Most ganglion cysts resolve spontaneously
without intervention.

(Choice A) Lipomas are benign neoplasms caused by the proliferation of fat cells. Although
they can occur on the wrist, they most commonly present on the trunk or proximal arms.
Lipomas do not transilluminate.

(Choice C) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by immune-mediated joint destruction.
It can be associated with rheumatoid nodules, which present as nontender subcutaneous
nodules over pressure points (eg, olecranon process). However, rheumatoid nodules do not
transilluminate, and patients with RA typically have symmetric joint swelling and pain in the
small joints of the hands and wrists, as well as characteristic joint deformities (eg, ulnar
deviation).

(Choice D) Synovial sarcoma occurs from the malignant transformation of synovial tissue and

can cause isolated swelling along the tendons. However, it does not transilluminate.
