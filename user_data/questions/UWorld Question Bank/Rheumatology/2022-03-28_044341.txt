(Choices A and C) Bacterial endocarditis can cause embolic septic infarctions in the kidneys
and intestines. Inherited coagulation disorders can also cause thrombosis with tissue
infarctions. However, biopsy would show a clot/embolism in the arterial lumen (during acute
infarction), not transmural inflammation and connective tissue proliferation.

(Choice B) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis usually causes manifestations in the upper/lower
airways (eg, rhinosinusitis, hemoptysis) and kidneys (eg, glomerulonephritis). The
gastrointestinal tract is not typically affected. Furthermore, biopsy generally reveals a
leukocytoclastic vasculitis with minimal or no luminal narrowing or fibrinoid necrosis.

(Choice E) Thromboangiitis obliterans occurs primarily in young smokers. It is marked by
inflammatory thrombi in the small- and medium-sized vessels of the extremities. Patients
usually have digital ulcers, ischemia, gangrene, or limb claudication. Mesenteric and renal
infarction would be atypical. In addition, transmural inflammation/connective tissue
proliferation would not be seen during the acute stage of infarction.

Educational objective:

Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized muscular arteries marked by
segmental, transmural, arterial wall inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis. This narrows the
arterial lumen and increases risk of thrombosis and tissue ischemia/infarction. Damage to the
