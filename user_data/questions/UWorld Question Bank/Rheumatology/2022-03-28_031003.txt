(Choices B and D) The leukotriene pathways can be blocked by inhibiting the 5-lipoxygenase
pathway or by blocking the leukotriene receptors. Zileuton is a specific inhibitor of the enzyme
5-lipoxygenase and inhibits leukotriene formation (LTB., LTC,, LTD,, and LTE,). Montelukast

inhibits LTD, receptors. Leukotriene modifiers are used in the treatment of asthma and allergic

rhinitis but have no role in the treatment of gout.

(Choice C) Cyclooxygenase (COX) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to
prostanoids. It exists in 2 isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that is
upregulated in inflammatory cells to increase synthesis of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid
metabolites. Standard NSAIDs (eg, indomethacin, ibuprofen) inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2,
while selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib) inhibit only COX-2.

Educational objective:

Colchicine is used for treatment of acute gouty arthritis in patients who cannot take
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It inhibits leukocyte migration and phagocytosis by
blocking tubulin polymerization. Significant side effects of colchicine include nausea and
diarrhea.
