A bursa is a fluid-filled synovial sac that serves to alleviate pressure and friction at bony
prominences and ligamentous attachments throughout the body. Bursae are vulnerable to
injury from acute trauma or chronic repetitive pressure and may also become inflamed due to
infection (septic bursitis), crystalline arthropathy (eg, gout), or autoimmune conditions (eg,
rheumatoid arthritis). Because bursae are located in prominent and exposed positions, the
pain of bursitis may be exquisite, and point tenderness is typical. Other features of bursitis
may include swelling and erythema, particularly with more superficial bursae. Active range of
motion is often decreased or painful, but passive motion is usually normal as it results in less

pressure on the inflamed bursa.

This patient with acute pain and localized tenderness associated with repetitive anterior knee
trauma from kneeling has typical features of prepatellar bursitis, sometimes called
"housemaid's knee." The prepatellar bursa is located between the patella and the overlying
skin. Other occupations associated with prepatellar and infrapatellar bursitis include carpet
layers, mechanics, and plumbers.

(Choice A) Anserine bursitis presents with pain along the medial knee and well-defined
tenderness approximately 4 cm distal to the anteromedial joint margin of the knee. It
frequently results from obesity or overuse in athletes.
