septic arthritis.

(Choice C) Radionuclide bone scans are useful in the evaluation of metastatic and infectious
bone disorders. However, the findings are sensitive but very nonspecific for potential causes
of synovitis.

(Choice D) Synovial fluid crystal analysis is the definitive test for gout. Serum uric acid levels
are less useful for diagnosis and may be normal during an acute gout attack. In addition,
serum uric acid levels do not rule out other important causes of synovitis such as septic
arthritis.

Educational objective:

Synovitis is characterized by pain, erythema, swelling, and reduced range of motion in a joint.
Acute synovitis may represent serious pathology (eg, septic arthritis), especially if
accompanied by fever or leukocytosis; it should be evaluated urgently with synovial fluid
analysis.
