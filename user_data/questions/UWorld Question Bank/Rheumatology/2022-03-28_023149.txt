muscle weakness associated with violaceous eruption on the eyelids and knuckles, and
elevated creatine kinase levels.

(Choice D) Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disorder that affects patients
age >50 and causes subacute pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips, weight loss, fever,
and malaise. This patient's age, soft tissue tenderness, and neuropsychiatric symptoms are
not consistent with PMR but are typical of fibromyalgia.

(Choice E) Rheumatoid arthritis causes a symmetric, inflammatory polyarthritis. It typically
presents with pain and morning stiffness of the metacarpophalangeal and proximal
interphalangeal joints. The affected joints are warm, swollen, and tender on palpation.

Educational objective:

Fibromyalgia occurs most commonly in women age 20-55 and presents with diffuse
musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and neuropsychiatric disturbances. It is characterized by
abnormal central processing of painful stimuli. Although initially painful, aerobic exercise helps
