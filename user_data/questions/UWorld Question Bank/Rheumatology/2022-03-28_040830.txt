(Choice C) The interosseous membrane is a broad sheet of connective tissue between the
radius and ulna that provides forearm stability and a point of attachment for the forearm
muscles. Injury to the membrane is associated with fracture of the radius or ulna after a fall
onto an outstretched hand.

(Choice D) Injury to the radial (lateral) collateral ligament of the elbow can occur with acute
varus stress during a fall onto an outstretched hand and is often associated with fracture or
dislocation of the elbow.

(Choice E) The ulnar (medial) collateral ligament is typically injured by intense, repetitive
overuse involving a valgus stress at the elbow (eg, pitching a baseball), resulting in medial
elbow pain that increases during throwing motions.

Educational objective:

Radial head subluxation (ie, nursemaid's elbow) is the displacement of the annular ligament
into the radiohumeral joint, classically resulting from sudden axial traction (eg, pulling) on the
arm of a child age <5. Although most patients do not have any obvious swelling or deformity,
they avoid moving the arm due to pain and hold it with the elbow flexed and forearm pronated.
