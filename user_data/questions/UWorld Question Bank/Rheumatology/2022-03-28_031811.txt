Pseudogout, or calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), results from
accumulation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the synovial fluid. Patients
present with an acute mono- or oligoarticular arthritis characterized by pain, joint swelling,
erythema, and warmth. Pseudogout and gout can be difficult to distinguish clinically. The
knee joint is involved in >50% of pseudogout cases, whereas the first metatarsophalangeal
joint is more frequently involved in gout.

In pseudogout, synovial fluid analysis reveals an elevated white blood cell count with
neutrophilic predominance. Identification of rhomboid-shaped calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate crystals is diagnostic. These crystals are positively birefringent under compensated
polarized light, meaning that the color pattern is the opposite of that seen in gout.
Pseudogout crystals are blue when aligned parallel and yellow when aligned perpendicular to
the slow ray of the compensator.

(Choice A) Calcific tendonitis results from the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals in
periarticular soft tissues (especially tendons). The rotator cuff tendons are most commonly
affected.

(Choice B) Calcium oxalate is one of the most common constituents of renal calculi.
