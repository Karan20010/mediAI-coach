The rotator cuff consists of the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor,
and subscapularis (SITS) and contributes to the stability and motion of the glenohumeral
joint. During abduction of the humerus, the supraspinatus initiates movement through the first
10-15 degrees; subsequently, the deltoid provides the primary abductive force while the
supraspinatus provides stability to the joint.

Of all the rotator cuff structures, the supraspinatus tendon is most commonly affected in
rotator cuff syndrome. This tendon is vulnerable to chronic repeated trauma from
impingement between the head of the humerus and the acromion during abduction.
Inflammation and fibrosis can worsen the problem by increasing friction between the head of
the humerus and the acromion, as well as causing inflammation of the subacromial bursa. On
examination, the action of the supraspinatus can be isolated with the "empty-can"
supraspinatus test: abduction of the humerus in parallel to the axis of the scapula (30 degrees
forward flexion) while in full internal rotation (thumbs pointed to the floor).

(Choice A) The long head of the biceps brachii originates on the supraglenoid tubercle of the
scapula and inserts on the radius. It primarily flexes and supinates the forearm, although it
also contributes to shoulder flexion. Biceps tendonitis is characterized by tenderness at the
bicipital groove (separates lesser and greater tubercles of the humerus).
