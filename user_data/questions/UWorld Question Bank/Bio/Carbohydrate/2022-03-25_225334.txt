(Choice F) Pyruvate kinase (PK) converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate during
glycolysis. PK deficiency causes chronic hemolytic anemia because glycolysis is the main
source of energy for erythrocytes.

Educational objective:

Glycogen debrancher deficiency (Cori disease) causes accumulation of glycogen with
abnormally short outer chains (limit dextrins) due to the inability to degrade branch points.
Patients have hypoglycemia, ketoacidosis, hepatomegaly, muscle weakness, and hypotonia.
