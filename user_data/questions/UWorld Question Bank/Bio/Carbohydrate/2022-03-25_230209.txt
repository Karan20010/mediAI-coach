This patient has decreased activity of erythrocyte transketolase (ETKA), a thiamine-
dependent enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway. This finding is essentially diagnostic
for thiamine (vitamin B,) deficiency. The primary risk factor for thiamine deficiency is
malnutrition; in this case, gastric bypass surgery without appropriate micronutrient
supplementation likely led to maternal thiamine deficiency and, in turn, to deficiency in this
exclusively breastfed infant.

In addition to involvement in transketolase activity, thiamine is a cofactor for other enzymes
involved in glucose metabolism (eg, 2-carbon transfer, decarboxylation), including alpha-
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase (converts pyruvate to acetyl-
CoA). Impaired pyruvate dehydrogenase activity diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis
pathway, which produces lactate. Lactic acidosis leads to decreased peripheral vascular
resistance, which contributes to the classic finding of high-output heart failure. However, over
time, direct impairment of myocyte energy production leads to reduced cardiac contractility and
a low-output state.
