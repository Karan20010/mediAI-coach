(Choice F) Oxaloacetate is the product of pyruvate carboxylase during gluconeogenesis. As
such, increased levels of oxaloacetate would decrease the activity of the enzyme.

Educational objective:

Acetyl-CoA stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the activity of pyruvate carboxylase
when acetyl-CoA is abundant. This regulatory step allows pyruvate to be shunted toward
acetyl-CoA production when acetyl-CoA levels are low, preventing the cell from becoming
depleted of energy.
