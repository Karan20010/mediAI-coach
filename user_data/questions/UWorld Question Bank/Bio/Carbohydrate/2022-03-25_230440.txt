This patient most likely has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
G6PD catalyzes the first step in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the oxidative portion
of which generates 2 molecules of NADPH while converting glucose-6-phosphate to ribulose-
5-phosphate. The nonoxidative reactions of the PPP reversibly convert ribulose-5-phosphate
into ribose-5-phosphate (substrate for nucleotide synthesis) or glycolytic intermediates that can
be used for energy production.

Because the PPP is the main source of NADPH, the pathway is particularly active in:

¢ Cells experiencing high oxidative stress (eg, erythrocytes) in which NADPH is used to
regenerate reduced glutathione, an antioxidant that helps maintain cell integrity

¢ Organs such as the liver and adrenal cortex that are involved in reductive biosynthesis
(eg, synthesis of fatty acids, cholesterol, steroids) and cytochrome P450 metabolism

e Phagocytic cells generating a respiratory burst via NADPH oxidase
