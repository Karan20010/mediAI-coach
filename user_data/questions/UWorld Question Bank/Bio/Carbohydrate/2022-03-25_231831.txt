(Choices A and D) Starch (similar to glycogen in mammals) is the major storage form of
carbohydrates in plants and contains only glucose molecules. Starch consists of an
unbranched portion composed of amylose and a branched portion called amylopectin.
Patients with fructosemia have normal metabolism of glucose.

(Choice B) Cellulose is a linear polysaccharide of glucose that is mainly present in the cell
wall of plant cells. Cellulose is an insoluble, indigestible dietary fiber that is responsible for the

bulk of fecal matter.

(Choices C, E, and F) Breast milk contains the disaccharides lactose (composed of galactose
and glucose) and maltose (composed of 2 glucose molecules). Patients with aldolase B
deficiency can consume these disaccharides as their breakdown will not produce fructose.
However, patients with galactosemia cannot metabolize galactose in breast milk or cow's milk-
based formula. These patients typically present in the first few days of life with jaundice,
vomiting, poor feeding, and hepatomegaly.

Educational objective:

Aldolase B deficiency, or hereditary fructose intolerance, leads to accumulation of the toxic
metabolite fructose-1-phosphate. Patients have hypoglycemia and vomiting when fructose or
sucrose is consumed. Treatment involves strict removal of both carbohydrates from the diet.
