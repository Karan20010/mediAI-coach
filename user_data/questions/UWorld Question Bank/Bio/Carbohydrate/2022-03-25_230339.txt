(Choice A) During muscle contraction, glycogen is broken down via glycogen phosphorylase
for energy production by the glycolytic pathway. Epinephrine causes cyclic AMP-mediated
phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase, which activates this enzyme. Non-
phosphorylation-dependent activation of glycogen phosphorylase can occur during muscle
contraction via increased intracellular calcium concentrations and via AMP under extreme
conditions.

(Choice B) Carnitine is an amino acid derivative responsible for transporting fatty acids into
the mitochondria for beta-oxidation. Carnitine is synthesized from lysine and methionine;
vitamin C is essential for this synthesis.

(Choice C) Citrate is formed from the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate in the first
step of the TCA cycle. Increased citrate concentrations decrease glycolysis as citrate is a
powerful allosteric inhibitor of phosphofructokinase-1. In exercising muscles under anaerobic
conditions, oxidative phosphorylation of glucose through the citric acid cycle is not a dominant
pathway; therefore, excess citrate is not produced.

(Choice D) FADH, is not produced in glycolysis. FADH, is produced from FAD during the

conversion of succinate to fumarate in the TCA cycle by the enzyme succinate
dehydrogenase.
