This patient most likely has glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease). This condition
is caused by deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (alpha-1,4 glucosidase or acid maltase),
an enzyme responsible for breaking down glycogen within the acidic environment of
lysosomes. Although most glycogen is degraded in the cytoplasm, a small percentage is
inadvertently engulfed by lysosomes, especially in cells containing high amounts of glycogen
such as hepatocytes and myocytes. Deficiency of acid maltase results in pathologic
accumulation of glycogen within liver and muscle lysosomes. Cardiac and skeletal muscle are
particularly susceptible because the ballooning lysosomes interfere with contractile function.

The classic form of the disease presents in early infancy with marked cardiomegaly, severe

generalized hypotonia, macroglossia, and hepatomegaly. Blood glucose levels are normal,

unlike with glycogen storage diseases that primarily affect the liver (eg, von Gierke disease). A
key distinguishing feature is that muscle biopsy will show accumulation of glycogen in
lysosomes.

(Choice B) Galactokinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of galactose to galactose-1-
phosphate in the first committed step of galactose catabolism. Galactokinase deficiency
causes neonatal cataract formation due to accumulation of galactitol in the lens.

(Choices C, D, and E) Other glycogen storage diseases are caused by deficiencies of
