(Choice B) Muscle converts pyruvate to alanine via transamination, which is then transported
to the liver where it is converted back to pyruvate for use in gluconeogenesis. Alanine
allosterically inhibits pyruvate kinase, preventing phosphoenolpyruvate from being consumed
by glycolysis during the gluconeogenic state.

(Choice C) Citrate is formed within mitochondria in the first reaction of the Krebs cycle, and
elevated levels act as an indicator of high cellular energy stores and abundant biosynthetic
intermediates. Citrate is therefore an important positive regulator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase
and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, key enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and
gluconeogenesis, respectively.

(Choice D) Regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis occurs mainly through the inverse
regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase by fructose 2,6-
bisphosphate. High levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activate phosphofructokinase-1 and
accelerate glycolysis; low levels disinhibit fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase and promote
gluconeogenesis.

(Choice E) Lactate is an important source of carbon atoms for glucose synthesis during
gluconeogenesis. During anaerobic glycolysis in skeletal muscle, pyruvate is reduced to

lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. Lactate formed in the contracting muscles is released into
