Educational objective:

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate
pathway, the major source of cellular NADPH. This molecule is necessary for reducing
glutathione (protects red blood cells from oxidative damage) and for the biosynthesis of
cholesterol, fatty acids, and steroids.
