Lactose (milk sugar) is degraded by lactase, the intestinal disaccharidase, to galactose and
glucose. Galactose is then phosphorylated to galactose-1-phosphate by the enzyme
galactokinase (GALK). Galactose-1-phosphate is converted to glucose-1-phosphate by
epimerization with transfer of uridine diphosphate (UDP) from UDP-glucose to UDP-
galactose. This reaction is catalyzed by galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT).
UDP-galactose is then epimerized to UDP-glucose by UDP-galactose-4 epimerase. Although
GALT deficiency is the most common form, a defect in any of these three enzymes can cause
galactosemia.

Galactosemia can present with vomiting and lethargy soon after initiation of breastfeeding.
In GALT deficiency, toxicity of accumulated galactose-1-phosphate is responsible for impaired
liver function (transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoglycemia) and renal dysfunction
(hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, aminoaciduria). Patients are also predisposed to
Escherichia coli (gram-negative rod) sepsis.

Restricting lactose intake (eg, breast milk) and initiation of soy milk-based formula can result in
regression of cataracts and improvement in renal and liver function. Soy milk consists of
sucrose, which is metabolized to glucose and fructose. Glucose and fructose do not need
GALT or GALK to enter the glycolytic pathway and generate energy.
