(Choices A and D) Phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase (active form) is allosterically
inhibited by ATP and glucose-6-phosphate in both liver and muscle cells. Increased
intracellular ATP levels help to decrease the rate of glycogenolysis upon cessation of active
muscle contraction.

(Choice C) Although increased cAMP stimulates muscle glycogen breakdown via the action
of epinephrine on beta-1 adrenergic receptors, it is not responsible for synchronization of
active muscle contraction and glycogen breakdown.

(Choice E) Lactate is produced in tissues during anaerobic glycolysis, such as in muscles
during strenuous exercise as a result of relatively hypoxic conditions. The lactate produced by
the muscles can be converted to glucose in the liver via gluconeogenesis.

Educational objective:

Synchronization of glycogen degradation with skeletal muscle contraction occurs due to
release of sarcoplasmic calcium following neuromuscular stimulation. Increased intracellular
calcium causes activation of phosphorylase kinase, stimulating glycogen phosphorylase to
increase glycogenolysis.
