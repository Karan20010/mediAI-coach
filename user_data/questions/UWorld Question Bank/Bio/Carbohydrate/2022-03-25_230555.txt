Dietary fructose is obtained mainly from fruits, vegetables, honey, table sugar (sucrose), and
processed foods. Fructose is rapidly absorbed in the proximal small bowel by the hexose
transporter GLUT 5. Initial metabolism of fructose involves three enzymes: fructokinase,
aldolase B, and triokinase. Fructose is phosphorylated on the first carbon by hepatic
fructokinase, yielding fructose-1-phosphate. Metabolism of fructose-1-phosphate by aldolase
B generates dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde is
then phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), an intermediate of glycolysis, by
triose kinase. DHAP can also be converted to G3P by triose phosphate isomerase.

Aldolase B deficiency causes the potentially life-threatening disorder known as hereditary
fructose intolerance. Patients typically present when fructose-containing foods are introduced
into the diet. The primary manifestations are vomiting and hypoglycemia about 20-30 minutes
after fructose ingestion. Hypoglycemia results from intracellular accumulation of fructose-1-
phosphate and depletion of inorganic phosphate, which inhibit glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Failure to thrive, hepatomegaly, and jaundice can also occur. Undiagnosed
individuals may eventually develop liver and renal failure. Elimination of dietary fructose is the
mainstay of treatment and results in symptom improvement with a good long-term prognosis.
