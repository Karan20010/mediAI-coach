(Choice B) Glucose-1-phosphate generated by glycogenolysis is converted by

phosphoglucomutase to glucose-6-phosphate. Unlike myophosphorylase,

phosphoglucomutase is present in both skeletal muscle and liver. Phosphoglucomutase

deficiency is extremely rare, presenting with muscle weakness and fasting hypoglycemia.

(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-phosphogluconate through a series of
reactions by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase in the
pentose phosphate pathway. This pathway maintains adequate levels of reduced glutathione,
which is needed to protect from oxidative injury (eg, prevent red cell hemolysis).

(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-
phosphate isomerase during glycolysis. A deficiency here would disrupt glycolysis, affecting
cells that rely on it as their energy source (eg, red blood cells). Patients have chronic
hemolytic anemia.

(Choice E) Within the liver and kidney, glucose-6-phosphatase converts glucose-6-phosphate
to glucose to help maintain blood glucose levels during fasting. A deficiency here leads to
glycogen storage disease type | (von Gierke disease), presenting in infancy with
hypoglycemia.
