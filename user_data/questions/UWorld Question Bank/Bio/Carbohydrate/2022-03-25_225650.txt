dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase.

(Choice A) Citrate synthase is an enzyme of the citric acid cycle; it does not require NAD or
NADP as a cofactor.

(Choices B and D) Hexokinase and phosphoglycerate kinase are enzymes used in
glycolysis; they do not require NAD or NADP as cofactors.

(Choice E) Succinate dehydrogenase is an enzyme of the citric acid cycle; it catalyzes the
conversion of succinate to fumarate using flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a cofactor.

Educational objective:

Niacin is a precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), two important cofactors for many dehydrogenase and
reductase enzymes. Niacin deficiency results in pellagra (ie, diarrhea, dementia, and

dermatitis).
