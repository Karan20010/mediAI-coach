3 Amino acid catabolism results in formation of TeMEGIES that are referred to as glucogenic,

4

5 ketogenic, or both. Glucogenic amino acid metabolism produces pyruvate or TCA cycle

6 intermediates, which can be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis. Ketogenic amino acid

7

8 metabolism generates the ketone body precursor acetyl-CoA. Lysine and leucine are

9

exclusively ketogenic amino acids; they cannot be metabolized to pyruvate and consumption
mT will not lead to increased production of lactic acid.

(Choices A and F) The non-essential glucogenic amino acids alanine and serine can be
is converted to pyruvate through a transamination reaction catalyzed by alanine transaminase
16 and a deamination reaction catalyzed by serine dehydratase, respectively.

(Choice B) Asparagine is catabolized to aspartate and subsequently transaminated to
i9 produce glutamate and oxaloacetate, an intermediate of the TCA cycle. Oxaloacetate by itself
cannot be used to produce energy; it must first undergo condensation with acetyl-CoA to form

+ 22 citrate.

(Choice C) The monosaccharide galactose is metabolized in the glycolytic pathway; dietary
intake will result in elevated levels of lactate in patients with pyruvate dehydrogenase
deficiency.

(Choice D) Glycerol is metabolized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolysis intermediate.
