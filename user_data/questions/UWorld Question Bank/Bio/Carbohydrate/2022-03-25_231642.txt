The majority of ATP used for cellular processes is generated by the oxidation of acetate in the
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. The enzymes of the TCA cycle are located in the mitochondria
and generate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine
dinucleotide (FADH.) (Choices C, D, F, and H). These molecules drive the process of
oxidative phosphorylation, which converts their reducing potential into high-energy ATP via the
electron transport chain.

ATP can also be generated by substrate-level phosphorylation, which involves the direct
transfer of a phosphate group from a reactive intermediate to a nucleotide diphosphate (eg,
ADP, GDP). Succinyl-CoA synthetase converts succinyl-CoA to succinate and uses the
high-energy thioester present in succinyl-CoA to drive GTP synthesis. This GTP can then be
used to transphosphorylate ADP to ATP, or it may be utilized by specific GTP-hydrolyzing
enzymes, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (converts oxaloacetate to
phosphoenolpyruvate during gluconeogenesis).

Educational objective:

GTP is synthesized by succinyl-CoA synthetase during the conversion of succinyl-CoA to
succinate in the citric acid cycle. During gluconeogenesis, phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase uses GTP to synthesize phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate.
