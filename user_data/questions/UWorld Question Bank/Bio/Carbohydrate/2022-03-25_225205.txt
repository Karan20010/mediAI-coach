This patient has pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, an inherited inborn error of
metabolism often presenting in infancy with lactic acidosis and neurologic defects. The
disease results from deficient activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, a multi-enzyme
complex generating acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, thereby linking glycolysis and the TCA cycle.
Dietary carbohydrates are broken down into pyruvate via glycolysis; in patients with pyruvate
dehydrogenase deficiency, the lack of enzymatic activity leads to a buildup of pyruvate,
which is shunted to lactate via lactate dehydrogenase, generating a potentially life-threatening

lactic acidosis.

Disease management involves the implementation of a ketogenic diet: a high-fat, low-
carbohydrate diet with moderate levels of protein. This diet forces the production of ketone
bodies from fat and amino acid catabolism to fuel the body in the place of glucose. The near-
absence of glucose in the diet decreases the amount of pyruvate generated, thereby
decreasing lactate levels.
