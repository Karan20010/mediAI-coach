(eg, primaquine, sulfa drugs). The resulting oxidative damage causes acute hemolytic
anemia and jaundice.

(Choice A) NADH can be used as a reducing agent to convert ADP to ATP during oxidative
phosphorylation. In contrast to NADH, NADPH cannot be used to convert ADP into ATP.

(Choice C) Glycogenesis is the process by which glucose is stored for later use through the
addition of glucose molecules to glycogen chains. It does not require NADPH.

(Choice D) Ketone bodies are formed mainly in the liver during times of fasting when there is
increased fat degradation. Cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase is the starting point of cholesterol
synthesis whereas the mitochondrial version of the enzyme is the rate-limiting step in ketone
body synthesis. Unlike cholesterol synthesis, ketone body production does not require
NADPH.

(Choice E) Protein catabolism begins with the hydrolysis of polypeptides into amino acids.
These subsequently undergo transamination reactions that funnel the amine nitrogen
predominately into glutamate, which is oxidatively deaminated to produce ammonia. The urea
cycle then converts ammonia into urea for elimination in the urine.

Educational objective:

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose phosphate
