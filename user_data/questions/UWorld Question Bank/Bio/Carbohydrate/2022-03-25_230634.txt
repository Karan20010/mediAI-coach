reactions and ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor for the synthesis of nucleotides. The pathway
consists of 2 types of reactions, oxidative (irreversible) and nonoxidative (reversible), both of
which can function independently depending on cellular requirements.

Activity of the nonoxidative reactions is governed by the cellular demand for ribose-5-
phosphate. When ribose-5-phosphate is produced in excess, transketolase and transaldolase
can produce the glycolytic intermediates glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-
phosphate for ATP generation. When ribose-5-phosphate demand exceeds the production
capabilities of the oxidative pathway, the nonoxidative pathway functions in reverse and
transketolase and transaldolase catalyze the conversion of fructose-6-phosphate and
glycerldehyde-3-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate.

(Choice A) Aconitase catalyzes the isomerization of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle.
(Choice B) Enolase catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate
in glycolysis.

(Choice C) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step of

the pentose phosphate pathway. Deficiency of this enzyme results in hemolytic anemia due to
the inability to generate NADPH in the oxidative portion of the pathway. However,
