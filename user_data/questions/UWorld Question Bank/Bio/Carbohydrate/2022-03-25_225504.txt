Fructose is obtained in the diet primarily from fruits and food sweeteners such as table sugar
(sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup. Fructose is absorbed in the proximal intestine through
the GLUT5 fructose transporter. It is normally phosphorylated by fructokinase in the liver,
yielding fructose-1-phosphate, which is converted by aldolase B to dihydroxyacetone
phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde (Choice C). Glyceraldehyde and DHAP can be
converted to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, which can then be metabolized in the glycolytic
pathway.

Fructokinase deficiency (essential fructosuria) is an asymptomatic, autosomal recessive
disorder that causes dietary fructose to be excreted unchanged in the urine. In fructokinase
deficiency, hexokinase takes over the role of fructose metabolism, converting dietary fructose
into fructose-6-phosphate. Fructose-6-phosphate can be metabolized in the glycolytic
pathway or converted to glucose-6-phosphate or glucose-1-phosphate, which can be used in
the pentose phosphate pathway or for glycogen synthesis, respectively.
