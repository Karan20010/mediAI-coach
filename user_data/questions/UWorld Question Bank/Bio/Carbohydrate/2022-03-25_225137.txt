able to maintain euglycemia. However, after a prolonged binge, hepatic glycogen is eventually
depleted and blood glucose levels drop.

(Choices C and D) Ethanol has no direct effect on insulin sensitivity. Impaired clearance of
insulin is a major contributor to hypoglycemia in patients with advanced renal insufficiency.

(Choice E) Excess NADH inhibits free fatty acid oxidation, thereby diverting free fatty acids
away from lipolysis to the formation of triglycerides. This contributes to alcohol-induced
hepatic steatosis but does not cause hypoglycemia.

Educational objective:
Ethanol inhibits gluconeogenesis and can cause hypoglycemia once hepatic glycogen stores
are depleted.
