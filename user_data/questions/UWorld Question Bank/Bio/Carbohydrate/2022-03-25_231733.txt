This asymptomatic patient with history of an inborn error of sugar metabolism most likely has
essential fructosuria. This benign, autosomal recessive disorder causes some of the dietary
fructose load to be secreted in the urine unchanged due to defective metabolism by
fructokinase. Fructose, similar to glucose and galactose, is a reducing sugar and can be
detected by a copper reduction test, which nonspecifically detects the presence of reducing
sugar. A urine dipstick, however, uses glucose oxidase to ascertain the presence of urinary
glucose and will not test positive in the presence of fructose or galactose.

(Choice A) Acid a-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes glycogen storage disease
type Il (Pompe disease). Affected infants have cardiomyopathy, muscle weakness, and
hypotonia.

(Choice B) Aldolase B deficiency is a life-threatening disorder caused by the inability to
metabolize fructose-1-phosphate (a toxic intermediate that accumulates in cells and depletes
intracellular phosphate). Patients become acutely symptomatic after ingesting fructose-
containing foods and eventually develop liver failure. Treatment includes elimination of dietary
fructose.
