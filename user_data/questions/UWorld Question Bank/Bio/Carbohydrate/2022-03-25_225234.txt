(Choice D) Glycerol is metabolized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, a glycolysis intermediate.
It can be used as a substrate to form pyruvate and, subsequently, lactate.

Educational objective:

Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency is an inherited inborn error of metabolism
causing lactic acidosis and neurologic defects. Patients are unable to convert pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA, resulting in a shunting of pyruvate to lactic acid. In these patients, metabolism of
exclusively ketogenic amino acids (eg, lysine, leucine) can provide energy in the form of
acetyl-CoA without increasing lactate production.
