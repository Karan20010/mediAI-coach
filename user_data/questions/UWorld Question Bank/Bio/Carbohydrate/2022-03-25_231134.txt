(Choices A, D, E, and G) Isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinate thiokinase, malate
dehydrogenase, and fumarase are enzymes that participate in the TCA cycle but do not use
FAD or FMN as cofactors.

(Choice B) Reduced glutathione is an antioxidant that minimizes oxidative damage in many
cells. Glutathione reductase regenerates reduced glutathione using nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) as an electron donor and FAD as a cofactor. Although
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pentose
phosphate pathway and supplies the necessary NADPH, it does not use FAD as a cofactor.

(Choice C) HMG-CoA reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis

pathway. FMN and FAD are not used as cofactors.

Educational objective:

Riboflavin is a precursor of the coenzymes FMN and FAD. FAD participates in the tricarboxylic
acid cycle and electron transport chain by acting as an electron acceptor for succinate
dehydrogenase (complex II), which converts succinate into fumarate.
