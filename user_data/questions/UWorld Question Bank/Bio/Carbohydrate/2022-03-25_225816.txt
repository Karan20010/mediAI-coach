This patient most likely has McArdle disease (glycogen storage disease type V). This
condition is caused by a deficiency of myophosphorylase, an isoenzyme of glycogen
phosphorylase present in muscle tissue. Deficiency leads to decreased breakdown of
glycogen during exercise, resulting in poor exercise tolerance, muscle cramps, and
rhabdomyolysis (eg, red urine). The prognosis is generally good, and symptoms can be
improved by consuming simple sugars before beginning physical activity.

During glycogenolysis, glycogen phosphorylase shortens glycogen chains by cleaving 1,4-
alpha-glycosidic linkages between glucose residues, liberating glucose-1-phosphate in the
process. This occurs until 4 residues remain before a branch point (the limit dextrin). At this
point, the debranching enzyme performs 2 enzymatic functions:

1. Glucosyltransferase cleaves the 3 outer glucose residues of the 4 that are left by glycogen
phosphorylase and transfers them to a nearby branch

2. The enzyme alpha-1,6-glucosidase removes the single remaining branch residue,
producing free glucose and a linear glycogen chain that can be further shortened by
glycogen phosphorylase
