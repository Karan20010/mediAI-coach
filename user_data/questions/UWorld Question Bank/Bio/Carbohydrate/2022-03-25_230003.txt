During gluconeogenesis, substances such as lactate and alanine are converted to pyruvate.
However, pyruvate cannot be converted to phosphoenolpyruvate directly as pyruvate kinase is
unidirectional. To convert pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate first undergoes biotin-
dependent carboxylation to oxaloacetate in the mitochondria. This reaction is catalyzed by
pyruvate carboxylase. The activity of pyruvate carboxylase is increased by acetyl-CoA.
This critical regulatory step diverts pyruvate to pyruvate dehydrogenase when acetyl-CoA
levels are too low, preventing the cell from becoming energy starved. When acetyl-CoA levels
are high (as with increased beta oxidation of fatty acids during fasting), pyruvate carboxylase
can operate at full capacity and convert most of the pyruvate into oxaloacetate for use in
gluconeogenesis.
