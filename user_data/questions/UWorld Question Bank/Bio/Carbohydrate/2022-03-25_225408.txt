The 2 major processes that maintain plasma glucose between meals are glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Glycogenolysis is the primary source of glucose for the first 12-18 hours of
fasting. Once hepatic glycogen stores become depleted, gluconeogenesis becomes the
major process used by the body to keep blood glucose levels within the normal range. During
gluconeogenesis, glucose is formed from lactate, glycerol, and glucogenic amino acids. This
process uses many of the enzymes involved in glycolysis. However, hexokinase,
phosphofructokinase, and pyruvate kinase are unidirectional and must be bypassed by
distinct gluconeogenic enzymes.

The first committed step of gluconeogenesis is the biotin-dependent carboxylation of pyruvate
to oxaloacetate by mitochondrial pyruvate carboxylase. Oxaloacetate is subsequently
converted to malate by malate dehydrogenase to facilitate exit from the mitochondria, and then
is converted back to oxaloacetate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (malate shuttle). In the
cytosol, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) converts oxaloacetate to
phosphoenolpyruvate. Therefore, pyruvate carboxylase and PEPCK work together to bypass
pyruvate kinase. The 2 other unique gluconeogenic enzymes are fructose 1,6-
bisphosphatase (bypasses phosphofructokinase) and glucose-6-phosphatase (bypasses
hexokinase).
