Glycogen debrancher deficiency (Cori disease) usually presents early in life with
hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, and ketoacidosis. Muscle involvement (eg, weakness,
hypotonia) helps distinguish it from other glycogen storage diseases that involve only the liver
(eg, von Gierke disease). Another key feature is cytosolic accumulation of abnormal
glycogen containing short outer chains, contributing to hepatic fibrosis.

During glycogenolysis, glycogen phosphorylase shortens glycogen chains by cleaving linkages
between glucose residues, liberating glucose-1-phosphate. This occurs until 4 residues
remain before a branch point (ie, limit dextrin). From here, debranching enzymes (glycogen
debrancher) perform 2 functions:

1. Glucosyltransferase cleaves the outer 3 of the 4 glucose residues, transferring them to a
nearby branch.

2. Alpha-1,6-glucosidase removes the single remaining residue, producing free glucose and
a linear glycogen chain that can be further shortened by glycogen phosphorylase.
