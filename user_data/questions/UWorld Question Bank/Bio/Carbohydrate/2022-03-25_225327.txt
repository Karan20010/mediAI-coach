a linear glycogen chain that can be further shortened by glycogen phosphorylase.

5 (Choice A) Small amounts of glycogen are engulfed by lysosomes and broken down by acid

: alpha-glucosidase (acid maltase). Acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease) is characterized

8 by cardiomegaly, severe generalized hypotonia, and lysosomal glycogen accumulation

9

(hypoglycemia is not seen).

(Choice B) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (von Gierke disease) affects mainly the liver

13 and kidney because the enzyme is not expressed in significant quantities in muscle tissue.

1s Major symptoms include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and hyperlipidemia. Hepatic steatosis
16 is a cardinal manifestation.

18 (Choice D) Liver glycogen phosphorylase deficiency (Hers disease) presents in early

childhood with mild hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hepatomegaly. However, it does not affect
21 skeletal muscles and shows an excess of normally structured glycogen (not abnormally short
"limit dextrins") on liver biopsy.

(Choice E) Muscle glycogen phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) presents with
decreased exercise tolerance, muscle cramping during strenuous activity, and myoglobinuria.
Blood lactate is often very low after exercise, and muscle biopsy shows an excess of normally

structured glycogen.
