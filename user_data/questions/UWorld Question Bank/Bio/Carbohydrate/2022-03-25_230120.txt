Glycogen is broken down by the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase, which is regulated
through phosphorylation (active state) and dephosphorylation (inactive state). Phosphorylase
kinase (PK) is the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase,
whereas phosphoprotein phosphatase catalyzes its dephosphorylation.

PK is regulated differently in liver than in muscles. Glycogen stored in the liver is used to
maintain blood glucose levels during the fasting state, whereas glycogen in the muscles is
used to provide energy for muscle contraction. In the liver, PK is activated primarily through
the binding of epinephrine and glucagon to G, protein-coupled receptors, which increases

cAMP concentrations and causes phosphorylation of PK (via protein kinase A).

Skeletal muscle lacks glucagon receptors, but muscle PK can still be phosphorylated in
response to an epinephrine-induced increase in cAMP concentrations. However, increased
intracellular calcium is a more powerful activator of muscle PK. Release of sarcoplasmic
calcium stores following neuromuscular acetylcholine stimulation allows for synchronization
of skeletal muscle contraction and glycogen breakdown, providing the energy necessary for
anaerobic muscle contraction.
