This patient's low urinary riboflavin excretion suggests a significant deficiency in riboflavin
intake. Symptomatic riboflavin deficiency is rare in the United States but can be seen with
chronic alcohol use and in severely malnourished patients. Clinical manifestations include
angular stomatitis, cheilitis, glossitis, seborrheic dermatitis, eye changes (eg, keratitis, corneal
neovascularization), and anemia.

The riboflavin (vitamin B,)-containing coenzymes are key constituents of the electron
transport chain. Typically, riboflavin is first phosphorylated to become flavin mononucleotide
(FMN), which can then be integrated into a coenzyme-flavin complex or further phosphorylated
to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FMN and FAD participate as coenzymes in numerous
reduction-oxidation reactions and are converted into reduced, energy-carrying states (FMNH,

and FADH.) through the acceptance of electrons.

FMN serves as a component of complex |, whereas FAD functions as a component of
succinate dehydrogenase (complex II). Complex II participates in both the electron transport
chain and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. During the TCA cycle, succinate dehydrogenase
converts succinate to fumarate and transfers electrons to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) via FAD.
Complex II also accepts electrons from other sources of FADH., such as fatty acid oxidation.
