Educational objective:

Hurler syndrome is a mucopolysaccharidosis caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase,
which hydrolyzes dermatan and heparan sulfate. Accumulation of these substances results in
the characteristic features of intellectual disability, coarse facial features, corneal clouding, and
hepatosplenomegaly. Early death due to cardiac complications (eg, myocardial infarction) is

expected.
