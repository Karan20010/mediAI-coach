Folate is a naturally occurring vitamin found in animal and plant products, most notably liver
and leafy green vegetables; it is also fortified in many cereals and grains. Therefore, folate
deficiency is rare in persons who consume a varied diet. However, deficiency can occur in
the setting of increased cell turnover (eg, pregnancy, chronic hemolytic anemia), medications
that interfere with folate metabolism (eg, methotrexate, antiseizure agents), and intestinal
malabsorption. This patient with celiac disease, who is noncompliant with dietary
restrictions, likely developed folate deficiency due to inflammation in the wall of the jejunum,
which impaired folate absorption.

Folate has a crucial role in the generation of purines and pyrimidines by converting
homocysteine to methionine. Specifically, 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate donates its methyl group
to vitamin B,., forming methylcobalamin, then methylcobalamin donates its methyl group to
homocysteine to form methionine. In folate deficiency, homocysteine cannot be converted to
methionine, leading to homocysteine accumulation (Choice C). In contrast, folate
supplementation results in the rapid conversion of homocysteine to methionine, leading to
low homocysteine and high methionine.

MethylImalonic acid is a biomarker for vitamin B,, because conversion of methylmalonyl-
