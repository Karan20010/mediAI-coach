MethyImalonic acid is a biomarker for vitamin B,, because conversion of methylmalonyl-
coenzyme A (CoA) to succinyl-CoA requires vitamin B,.. Because methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
is not a folate-dependent enzyme, it is unaffected by changes in folate level.

(Choice B) Decreased homocysteine, increased methionine, and decreased methylmalonic
acid would be expected after vitamin B,. supplementation, not folate supplementation.

(Choice D) Increased homocysteine, decreased methionine, and increased methylmalonic
acid would be expected in vitamin B,, deficiency.

(Choice E) Isolated methylmalonic acidemia occurs in a rare autosomal recessive condition
and is unrelated to folate deficiency and supplementation.

Educational objective:

Reduced forms of folate serve as methyl group donors in the synthesis of methionine. Folate
deficiency leads to impaired methionine synthesis with accumulation of homocysteine, a
precursor to methionine. Methylmalonic acid metabolism is unaffected by folate deficiency.
