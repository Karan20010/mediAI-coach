glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates a-ketoglutarate.
Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in
humans. Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine.

(Choices C, D, and E) Malate, citrate, and oxaloacetate are all intermediates of the
tricarboxylic acid cycle.

(Choice B) L-citrulline is an amino acid produced as an intermediate in the conversion of
ornithine to argininosuccinate during the hepatic urea cycle.

Educational objective:

Alanine is the major amino acid responsible for transferring nitrogen to the liver for disposal.
During the catabolism of proteins, amino groups are transferred to a-ketoglutarate to form
glutamate. Glutamate is then processed in the liver to form urea, the primary disposal form of
nitrogen in humans. Free ammonia is also excreted into the urine by the kidney for regulation
of acid-base status.
