This patient has inclusion cell (I-cell) disease, an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage
disorder. |-cell disease occurs due to defects in protein targeting, a process by which proteins
are transported to their appropriate intra- or extracellular location.

Normally, posttranslational modifications (eg, folding, glycosylation, phosphorylation) function
as markers that help guide proteins to their final destination. For lysosome-bound proteins
(ie, acid hydrolases), a Golgi body phosphotransferase enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation
of mannose residues on the proteins. Once tagged with mannose-6-phosphate, these
proteins traverse the Golgi network and are ultimately transported to the lysosome, where they
serve as catalysts for degradation of cellular components.

In I-cell disease, a defective phosphotransferase enzyme results in deficient
phosphorylation (ie, incorrect targeting) of mannose residues on acid hydrolases, which are
then inappropriately secreted to the extracellular space. This leads to lack of degradation of
lysosomal cellular debris, which accumulates within the lysosome, forming the characteristic
inclusion bodies. Patients with this disorder typically have failure to thrive, respiratory tract
infections, and cognitive deficits in the first year of life, along with characteristic physical
features (eg, coarse facies, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly).
