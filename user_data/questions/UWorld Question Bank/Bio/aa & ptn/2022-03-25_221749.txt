A 7-day-old neonate born to a 28-year-old woman is brought to the office due to progressive
lethargy, vomiting, and poor feeding. The mother reports an uneventful pregnancy and
perinatal course. She exclusively breastfeeds the infant and has no medical problems in any
of her other children. On examination, the infant is somnolent and dehydrated with decreased
muscle tone. Laboratory studies reveal metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap,

ketosis, and hypoglycemia. Further evaluation reveals a markedly elevated propionic acid
level due to defective conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. This patient is most
likely unable to use which of the following amino acids for energy production?
