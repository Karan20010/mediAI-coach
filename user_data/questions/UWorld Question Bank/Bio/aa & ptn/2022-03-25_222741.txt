(Choice A) Ascorbate (vitamin C) is a water-soluble vitamin required for hydroxylation of
proline and lysine residues during collagen synthesis. Deficiency results in scurvy, a disease
characterized by bone pain, easy bruising, and poor wound healing.

(Choice C) Pyridoxine (vitamin B.) acts as a coenzyme in the decarboxylation and

transamination of amino acids, including the metabolism of tryptophan to niacin. Deficiency of

pyridoxine leads to anemia, peripheral neuropathy, and dermatitis. Supplementation in

Hartnup disease is not effective due to underlying tryptophan malabsorption.

(Choice D) The coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide
(FAD) form the prosthetic groups of several enzymes important in electron transport; both are
synthesized from riboflavin (vitamin B,). Clinical features of deficiency include sore throat,
stomatitis, glossitis, normocytic anemia, and seborrheic dermatitis.

(Choice E) Thiamine use by the body is maximal in states of accelerated carbohydrate
metabolism because thiamine acts as a cofactor for the enzymes transketolase (pentose
phosphate pathway), a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (TCA cycle), and pyruvate
dehydrogenase (forms acetyl-CoA).

(Choice F) Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that functions as a scavenger of free radicals
