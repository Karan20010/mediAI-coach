This patient has features of arginase deficiency, including progressive development of
spastic diplegia, abnormal movements, and growth delay in the setting of elevated
arginine levels. Arginase is a urea cycle enzyme that produces urea and ornithine from
arginine. Diagnosis is based on elevated arginine levels on plasma amino acid testing.
Treatment of arginase deficiency consists of a low-protein diet devoid of arginine.
Administration of a synthetic protein made of essential amino acids usually results in a
dramatic decrease in plasma arginine concentration and an improvement in neurological
abnormalities. Unlike other urea cycle disorders, patients with arginase deficiency have mild
or no hyperammonemia.
