This patient's severe intellectual disability, history of seizures, and abnormal pallor of
catecholaminergic brain nuclei on autopsy are suggestive of phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU
results from the inability to convert phenylalanine into tyrosine, a reaction which is normally
catalyzed by phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme requires the cofactor
tetrahydrobiopterin (BH,), which is regenerated from dihydrobiopterin (BH.) by the enzyme
dihydropteridine reductase. Although neonatal hyperphenylalaninemia can be caused by
deficiency of either enzyme, most cases are attributable to abnormalities in phenylalanine
hydroxylase.

It is believed that excess phenylalanine and the presence of large concentrations of
phenylalanine metabolites (eg, phenyllactate & phenylacetate) contribute to the brain damage
seen in PKU. Hypopigmentation involving the skin, hair, eyes, and catecholaminergic brain
nuclei (which produce a dark pigment known as neuromelanin) results from the inhibitory effect
of excess phenylalanine on melanin synthesis. The classic musty or mousy body odor is due
to the accumulation of abnormal phenylalanine metabolites.
