This patient with phenylketonuria (PKU) most likely has a deficiency of dihydrobiopterin
reductase (reduces BH, to BH.) based on the combination of hyperphenylalaninemia and
elevated prolactin. Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase
using BH, as a cofactor. Tyrosine is converted to DOPA via the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase,
which also uses BH, as a cofactor. Once DOPA is synthesized, it is decarboxylated to
dopamine by DOPA decarboxylase. Dopamine ultimately serves as the precursor molecule to
the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine.

In classic PKU, supplementation of tyrosine allows for normal catecholamine production due to
intact function of tyrosine hydroxylase. However, deficiency of dihydrobiopterin reductase
results in both hyperphenylalaninemia from impaired phenylalanine hydroxylase activity and
low dopamine levels from impaired tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Although phenylalanine
levels can be controlled by dietary restriction, downstream deficiencies of neurotransmitters
(eg, dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin) lead to progressive neurologic
deterioration in these patients. Normally, dopamine from the tuberoinfundibular system
tonically inhibits prolactin release. Decreased BH, causes lower levels of dopamine, resulting

in increased prolactin levels.
