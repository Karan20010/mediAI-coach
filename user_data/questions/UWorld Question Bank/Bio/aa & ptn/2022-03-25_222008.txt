(Choices A and C) Although defects in carbamoyl phosphate synthetase | and N-
Acetylglutamate synthetase also result in hyperammonemia, levels of carbamoyl phosphate
are low and orotic acid is not elevated in the urine.
(Choice B) Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency (Lesch-Nyhan

syndrome) results in hyperuricemia because purines cannot be salvaged from degraded DNA.
Urate kidney stones and self-mutilation are classic clinical manifestations.

(Choice E) Uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS) is part of the pyrimidine synthesis
pathway. UMPS deficiency leads to orotic acid buildup (similar to OTC deficiency) but not
hyperammonemia. Characteristic findings include megaloblastic anemia and delayed growth.

Educational objective:

Patients with urea cycle disorders typically have discrete episodes of vomiting, tachypnea, and
confusion/coma secondary to hyperammonemia (a metabolic emergency). Ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common disorder of the urea cycle and is
characterized by hyperammonemia and elevated urinary orotic acid.
