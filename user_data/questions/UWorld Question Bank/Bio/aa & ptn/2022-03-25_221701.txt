Enzymes and the biochemical processes they catalyze often require distinct chemical
environments for optimal function; small variations in temperature, molecular concentrations,
and pH may render them ineffective. Cellular compartmentalization provides a means by
which multiple heterogeneous environments can exist within a cell. Organelles such as the
nucleus and mitochondria form distinct, membrane-bound regions with a chemical composition
different from the cytosol. This allows multiple biochemical processes to occur simultaneously
at maximum efficiency.

The cytosol and mitochondria are the predominant sites of metabolism in the cell.
Mitochondria are the site of beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the citric acid cycle, and the
carboxylation of pyruvate (gluconeogenesis). The cytosol is home to enzymes necessary for
glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. Transketolase is an
enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that uses thiamine (vitamin B,) as a cofactor to
shuttle 2-carbon fragments between sugar molecules. Other processes such as heme
synthesis, the urea cycle, and gluconeogenesis rely on a complex interplay between the
mitochondria and cytosol to function optimally; enzymes present in both cellular compartments
are required for these metabolic pathways.
