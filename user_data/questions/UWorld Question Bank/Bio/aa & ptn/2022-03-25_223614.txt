5. Tropocollagen monomers self-assemble into collagen fibrils. Finally, lysyl oxidase helps
create covalent crosslinks between collagen fibrils to form strong collagen fibers.

Educational objective:

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of rare hereditary disorders characterized by defective
collagen synthesis. It can be caused by procollagen peptidase deficiency, which results in
impaired cleavage of terminal propeptides in the extracellular space. Patients often have joint
laxity, hyperextensible skin, and tissue fragility due to the formation of soluble collagen that

does not properly crosslink.
