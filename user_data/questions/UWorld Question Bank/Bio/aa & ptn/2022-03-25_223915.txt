(Choice A) Restriction of branched-chain amino acids (eg, valine, leucine, isoleucine) is used
to treat maple syrup urine disease (branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase deficiency)
and propionic acidemia (propionyl-CoA carboxylase).

(Choice B) Fructose and sucrose restriction is the treatment for fructose 1-phosphate
aldolase (aldolase B) deficiency. This condition causes vomiting and hypoglycemia in infants

after fruit or juice is introduced.

(Choice C) Galactose and lactose are excluded from the diet in patients with classic
galactosemia (absent galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase). Galactosemia presents in
neonates with jaundice, vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hypoglycemia, and galactose-1-
phosphate accumulation.

(Choice D) Medium-chain triglycerides are restricted in medium-chain acyl-CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency, a condition characterized by lethargy, seizures, and hypoketotic
hypoglycemia following a period of fasting.

(Choice E) A phenylalanine-free diet is recommended in patients with phenylketonuria
(phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency). Failure to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine leads to
accumulation of phenylalanine and intellectual disability if the condition is left untreated.
