Ammonia generated from the metabolism of amino acids is converted into urea by the urea
cycle. The combination of bicarbonate (HCO.-), ammonia, and ATP is catalyzed by carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase (rate-limiting enzyme in the urea cycle) to yield carbamoyl! phosphate.
Carbamoyl phosphate combines with ornithine to form citrulline in a reaction catalyzed by
ornithine transcarbamylase. Citrulline enters the cytosol and is converted to argininosuccinate,
which is then converted to arginine. The conversion of arginine to ornithine by arginase
completes the urea cycle by releasing a urea molecule. N-acetylglutamate serves as a
regulator of the urea cycle through activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I.

This patient most likely has ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, the most
common urea cycle disorder. OTC deficiency results in excess carbamoyl phosphate, which
stimulates pyrimidine synthesis. As an intermediate product in this pathway, orotic acid
accumulates and results in increased urinary orotic acid.
