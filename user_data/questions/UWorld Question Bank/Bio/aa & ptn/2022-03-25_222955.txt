This patient's clinical presentation suggests phenylketonuria (PKU). Classic PKU (the most
common form) occurs most frequently in persons of Scandinavian descent. Individuals who
are homozygous for this autosomal recessive disorder have a severe deficiency of
phenylalanine hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of phenylalanine to
tyrosine. Tyrosine becomes an essential amino acid in these patients as it cannot be
synthesized from phenylalanine, although most patients receive adequate amounts in their diet
and do not require supplementation. Furthermore, the excess phenylalanine inhibits
tyrosinase, which normally results in the downstream production of melanin. The lack of
melanin causes the fair complexion seen in this patient.

Although development is initially normal, most untreated patients develop intellectual
disability by age 6 months. Other classic findings include seizures, eczema, light hair/skin
pigmentation, and a "musty," odor. However, cognitive impairment can be lessened by early
detection (newborn screening) and restriction of phenylalanine intake.
