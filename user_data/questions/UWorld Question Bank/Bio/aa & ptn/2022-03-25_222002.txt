Patients also have hyperammonemia due to impaired ammonia excretion, which is a
metabolic emergency. Ammonia is neurotoxic and causes episodes of vomiting and
confusion/coma. Tachypnea also occurs due to cerebral edema from ammonia buildup,
resulting in central hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. Metabolic decompensation is
often triggered by illness (eg, viral upper respiratory infection, acute otitis media), fasting, or

increased protein intake.
