Pyridoxine (vitamin B,) is necessary for the transamination and decarboxylation of amino
acids, for gluconeogenesis, and for other essential biochemical processes. Transamination
reactions typically occur between an amino acid and an a-keto acid. The amino group is
transferred to the a-keto acid from the amino acid, and the a-keto acid thereby becomes an
amino acid. For example, glutamate (amino acid) reacts with oxaloacetate (a-keto acid) to
form aspartate (the resulting amino acid) and a-ketoglutarate (the resulting a-keto acid).

Transaminases (aminotransferases) are the enzymes that catalyze transamination reactions,
and pyridoxal phosphate (active vitamin B,) serves as an essential cofactor for the

transaminase.
