(Choices D and E) Vitamin B,, is a cofactor for the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase in the
conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA, a reaction that occurs in the breakdown of
odd-chain fatty acids and some amino acids. As a result, patients with vitamin B,. deficiency
have elevated methylmalonyl-CoA levels that subsequently result in buildup of neurotoxic
methylmalonic acid. Symptomatic consequences include lethargy, seizures, paresthesias, and
hypotonia. Homocysteine is elevated in both folate and vitamin B,, deficiencies, but

methylmalonyl-CoA is elevated in vitamin B,, deficiency only.

Educational objective:

Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine are an independent risk factor for thrombotic events.
Homocysteine can be metabolized to methionine via remethylation or to cystathionine via
transsulfuration. Hyperhomocysteinemia is most commonly due to genetic mutations in critical
enzymes or deficiencies of vitamin B,., vitamin Bg, and folate.
