or no hyperammonemia.

(Choice A) The amino acid derivative y-aminobutyrate (GABA) is a well-known inhibitor of
presynaptic transmission in the retina and central nervous system. GABA is formed from
glutamate decarboxylation, a reaction catalyzed by glutamate decarboxylase.

(Choice B) Glutamine is the major amino acid in the blood because it transports excess
ammonia from peripheral tissues to the kidney. In the nephron, the amide nitrogen is
hydrolyzed by glutaminase to regenerate glutamate and a free ammonium ion, which can then
be excreted in the urine.

(Choice C) Deficiencies of vitamins B,, B,., and folate (B.) are associated with
hyperhomocysteinemia, which in turn is associated with atherosclerosis and thrombotic
events.

(Choice D) Orotic acid is overproduced when a block in the urea cycle leads to excess
carbamoyl phosphate, which is metabolized by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase to orotic acid.
Excessive amounts of orotic acid are usually found in citrullinemia and ornithine
transcarbamylase deficiency. These urea cycle disorders are also accompanied by
hyperammonemia.
