This patient likely has hereditary orotic aciduria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder of de
novo pyrimidine synthesis that results in physical and mental retardation (eg, low
height/weight, delayed developmental milestones), megaloblastic anemia (eg, elevated mean
corpuscular volume, low reticulocyte count), and elevated urinary orotic acid levels.
Increased urinary orotic acid may also be seen in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency;
however, patients with this condition classically have failure to thrive and hyperammonemic
encephalopathy within the first few weeks of life (due to impaired urea synthesis).

Hereditary orotic aciduria occurs due to a defect in uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP)
synthase, a polypeptide containing 2 enzymatic domains (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase
and OMP decarboxylase) that catalyze the final conversion of orotic acid to UMP. Impaired
conversion of orotic acid to UMP results in the excretion of large amounts of orotic acid in the
urine and the clinical features described above. Uridine supplementation can bypass this
enzymatic defect and improve symptoms as uridine is converted to UMP via nucleoside
kinases.
