(Choice B) HbS and HbC do not differ significantly from normal hemoglobin in affinity to 2,3-
bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). In addition, weaker interaction with 2,3-BPG would lead to
increased oxygen affinity (left shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve), which would
help ameliorate sickling.

(Choice C) The ability of HbS to polymerize helps stabilize the deoxygenated form, causing a
right shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve that facilitates oxygen unloading. In
contrast, impaired oxygen unloading occurs with carboxyhemoglobin due to an allosteric
change that increases the affinity of the remaining 3 oxygen-binding sites.

(Choice D) Aglu — val substitution affects the 3-dimensional (tertiary) structure of

hemoglobin, but it does not result in a significant change in the alpha helical (secondary)

structure. Introducing proline into the primary structure could distort the alpha helix due to

proline's rigid cyclic structure.

(Choice E) HbS and HbC mutations do not involve amino acids lining the heme pocket.

Heme iron oxidation (ferrous [Fez] — ferric [Fe*]) results in methemoglobin formation.

Hemoglobin M disease is a congenital cause of methemoglobinemia due to a mutation in the

heme-binding pocket. Activate Windows
