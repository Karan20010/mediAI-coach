Lactose is a disaccharide present in milk and other dairy products that is normally hydrolyzed
into glucose and galactose by lactase, a brush border enzyme concentrated in epithelial cells
of the small intestine. Lactose intolerance is due to decreased or absent lactase.
Malabsorbed lactose then enters the large intestine where it is fermented by bacteria, causing
the clinical features of lactose intolerance: diarrhea, flatulence, and abdominal bloating and
cramping.

Lactose intolerance can be either primary or secondary. Primary lactose intolerance is due to
a genetically regulated reduction of lactase production, and its incidence increases with age.
Secondary or acquired lactose intolerance can be due to inflammation (eg, celiac disease) or
infection (eg, giardiasis) of the small intestine, both of which cause cellular damage to the
intestinal lining. The damaged cells slough off and are replaced by immature cells with low
lactase concentrations, resulting in a decreased ability to convert lactose to galactose.
Secondary lactose intolerance is common after giardial infections.
