This question describes a scenario in which uracil is found in association with bacterial DNA
during prokaryotic DNA replication. In general, uracil is found only in RNA, so the question
essentially asks which enzyme involved in DNA synthesis catalyzes the formation of RNA
strands. In prokaryotic DNA replication, primase (an RNA polymerase) is responsible for
synthesizing a short RNA primer using the separated strands of DNA at the replication fork as
templates. DNA replication then proceeds, with DNA polymerase using the 3' hydroxyl group
of the RNA primer as a starting point for synthesis. Primase is a crucial enzyme for bacterial
replication as DNA polymerase cannot initiate DNA synthesis without this short nucleic acid
sequence primer.

(Choice A) DNA ligase is the enzyme that repairs single-strand breaks in duplex DNA during
DNA replication and repair.

(Choices B and C) During replication, DNA polymerase III is the primary enzyme responsible
for synthesis of daughter DNA strands; DNA polymerase | functions chiefly to replace the RNA
primers with DNA segments. Unlike DNA polymerase III, DNA polymerase | has 5'= 3'
exonuclease activity that can remove RNA primers and damaged DNA segments. The 3'> 5'
exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase | and III provides a proofreading function that fixes
mismatched nucleotides in the newly formed daughter strands.
