sufficient quantity of purine nucleotides.

(Choices A, B, and F) These enzymes are involved in pyrimidine synthesis. Their activity
would not be significantly altered in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, which impairs purine salvage.

(Choice C) The activity of HGPRT is decreased (not increased) in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.

(Choice E) Purine and pyrimidine nucleotides are initially synthesized as bases attached toa
ribose sugar. The enzyme ribonucleotide reductase converts ribose sugars to their
deoxyribose forms for use in DNA synthesis. This enzyme is negatively regulated by
accumulation of deoxyribose nucleotides; its activity is determined primarily by the cellular
proliferation rate (increased cell division requires more deoxyribose nucleotides).

Educational objective:

Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder caused by a defect in hypoxanthine-
guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This results in failure of the purine salvage
pathway, leading to increased degradation of hypoxanthine and guanine to uric acid. De novo
purine synthesis must increase to replace the lost bases, necessitating an increase in
phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase activity.
