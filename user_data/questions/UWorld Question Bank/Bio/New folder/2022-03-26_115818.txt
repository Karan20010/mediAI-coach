without treatment.

(Choices A, B, E, and G) Glycolytic enzyme deficiencies (eg, aldolase A, enolase,
phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase) generally present with hemolytic anemia because red
blood cells rely completely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production.

(Choice D) Lactate dehydrogenase is present in most cells and catalyzes the conversion of
pyruvate to lactate during anaerobic glycolysis. Deficiency can cause decreased exercise
tolerance and muscle stiffness.

(Choice F) Pyruvate carboxylase, one of the gluconeogenesis pathway enzymes in the
mitochondria, catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Deficiency of pyruvate
carboxylase causes lactic acidosis and fasting hypoglycemia.

Educational objective:
Insulin release by pancreatic beta cells is stimulated by increased glucose metabolism and
ATP production. Glucokinase functions as a glucose sensor in pancreatic beta cells by
controlling the rate of glucose entry into the glycolytic pathway. Mutations in the glucokinase

gene lead to a state in which higher glucose levels are required to stimulate insulin secretion
and are a cause of maturity-onset diabetes of the young.
