(Choice A) Hemoglobin A,. is formed by non-enzymatic glycosylation of hemoglobin A.
Glycosylation can interfere with the binding of 2,3-BPG to hemoglobin by altering the physical
structure of the binding pocket, which is compensated for by increased red cell 2,3-BPG levels
in patients with diabetes. However, the reduced 2,3-BPG binding affinity of this patient’s
mutated hemoglobin more closely resembles that of hemoglobin F.

(Choice B) Hemoglobin C results from a mutation in the B-globin chain that causes glutamate
to be replaced by lysine. Hemoglobin C forms hexagonal crystals and promotes red cell
dehydration, causing a mild chronic hemolytic anemia. 2,3-BPG binding and tissue oxygen
delivery are not significantly altered.

(Choice D) A defect in the synthesis of alpha chains results in varying degrees of alpha
thalassemia, which is characterized by the formation of B-globin and y-globin tetramers
(hemoglobin H and Barts, respectively). These abnormal tetramers have extremely high
oxygen affinity (resembling myoglobin) and are ineffective at delivering oxygen to tissues.

(Choice E) Hemoglobin S is the predominant form of hemoglobin in sickle cell disease and is
caused by replacement of a glutamate by valine in the B-globin chain. This results in formation
of hemoglobin polymers with reduced oxygen affinity.
