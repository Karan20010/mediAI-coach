joice A ucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD) leads to acute hemolytic
anemia in response to oxidative stress. Neurologic manifestations are not present in G6PD-
associated anemia.
(Choice B) Erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity may be decreased in patients with

vitamin B, (riboflavin) deficiency because glutathione reductase uses bound FAD (derived from
vitamin B,) and NADPH as cofactors to reduce disulfide bonds. Vitamin B, deficiency typically
presents with normocytic anemia and inflammation of the lips (cheilosis), mouth (stomatitis),
and/or tongue (glossitis).

(Choice C) Pyruvate kinase generates ATP through the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate
to pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an autosomal recessive condition that typically
presents with congenital hemolytic anemia due to impaired glycolytic ATP generation.

(Choice D) Transketolase is an enzyme of the hexose monophosphate pathway that utilizes
thiamine (vitamin B,) as a coenzyme. Erythrocyte transketolase activity is decreased in

thiamine deficiency, which causes Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and beriberi.

(Choice F) Serum protoporphyrin levels are increased in iron deficiency anemia, lead

poisoning, and erythropoietic protoporphyria. Lead poisoning can cause sideroblastic anemia

and peripheral neuropathy, but other characteristic features (eg, abdominal/musculoskeletal
