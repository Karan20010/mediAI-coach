In sickle cell (hemoglobin S [HbS]) anemia, the nonpolar amino acid valine replaces the
charged amino acid glutamate at position 6 of the B globin chain. This results in the alteration
of a hydrophobic portion of the B globin chain that fits into a complementary site on the a
globin chain of another hemoglobin molecule. As a result, hemoglobin molecules aggregate
under anoxic conditions. After polymerization, HbS initially forms a gel and then a meshwork
of fibrous polymers causing the red blood cells to distort into an abnormal sickle shape.

Sickling is promoted by conditions associated with low oxygen levels, increased acidity, or
low blood volume (dehydration). Sickled cells are not flexible enough to pass through
microvasculature. As a result, they impede blood flow and cause microinfarcts in tissues and
painful vasoocclusive crises. Organs in which blood moves slowly (eg, spleen, liver) are
predisposed to lower oxygen levels or acidity. Organs with particularly high metabolic
demands (eg, brain, muscles, placenta) promote sickling by extracting more oxygen from the
blood (oxygen unloading). The sickling process is complex and incompletely understood.
