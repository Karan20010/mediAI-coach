This patient has cataracts, a vision-impairing opacification of the lens that causes loss of the
red reflex with decreased visualization of retinal details on ophthalmoscopic evaluation. The
incidence of cataracts increases with age; other risk factors include smoking, excessive
sunlight exposure, diabetes mellitus, and glucocorticoid use. In this patient, long-term
hyperglycemia most likely contributed to cataract formation by causing oversaturation of the
polyol pathway.

The first step in the polyol pathway (an alternative route of glucose metabolism) is the
conversion of glucose into sorbitol by aldose reductase. Sorbitol cannot readily cross cell
membranes and is therefore trapped inside the cells where it forms. The second enzyme in
the pathway, sorbitol dehydrogenase, is able to convert sorbitol into fructose at a sufficient
rate to prevent accumulation when glucose levels are normal. However, the process is slow;
in long-standing hyperglycemia, sorbitol accumulates in tissues with lower sorbitol
dehydrogenase activity, such as the retina, lens, kidney, and peripheral nerves.

Sorbitol accumulation increases cellular osmotic and oxidative stress and contributes to
the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. In lens cells, the
increased stress leads to the development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate, eventually
resulting in lens opacification and cataract formation.
