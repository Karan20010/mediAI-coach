19 (Choices A, B, C, and D) Methemoglobin cannot bind to oxygen and therefore the oxygen
content and oxygen carrying capacity of the arterial blood will decrease. The bound fraction of
22 oxygen and oxygen delivery to the peripheral tissues will also decrease due to
methemoglobin's inability to carry and deliver oxygen.

Educational objective:

27 Methemoglobinemia causes dusky discoloration of the skin (similar to cyanosis), and because
methemoglobin is unable to carry oxygen, a state of functional anemia is induced. However,
30 the blood partial pressure of oxygen will be unchanged as it is a measure of oxygen dissolved

in plasma and is unrelated to hemoglobin function.
