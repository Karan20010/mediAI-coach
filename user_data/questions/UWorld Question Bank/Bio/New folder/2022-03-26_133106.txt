(Choice A) Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that is elevated in maple syrup urine
disease. Isoleucine and valine are also increased. Impaired metabolism of these amino acids
leads to cerebral edema, seizures, and a sweet smell of the urine.

(Choice B) Conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is defective in phenylketonuria and
usually occurs due to a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase. Undiagnosed and untreated
phenylketonuria results in significant intellectual disability not seen in this patient.

(Choice C) Impaired renal cystine (a homodimer of cysteine) transport leads to cystinuria, a
disease characterized by flank pain, hematuria, and renal stones in childhood or adolescence.

(Choice E) Sickle cell anemia results from the substitution of valine for glutamic acid due to a
single-nucleotide polymorphism. This mutation leads to loss of red cell elasticity,
polymerization of sickle hemoglobin, and sickling of red blood cells, which results in
vasoocclusive crises.
