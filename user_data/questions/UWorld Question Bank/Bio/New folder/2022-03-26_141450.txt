wanes, patients will become symptomatic.

(Choice A) a-globin is a normal component of both HbA and HbF. a-globin synthesis is
defective in a-thalassemia but it is normal in B-thalassemia. a-globin is able to combine with y-
globin to form HbF. This allows patients with B-thalassemia major to be asymptomatic in utero
and in the first few months following birth.

(Choice B) B-globin synthesis is defective in patients with b-thalassemia.

(Choice D) d-globin is a minor globin gene that is expressed at very low levels in normal
adults. Two a-globins and two 6-globins combine to form hemoglobin A2.

(Choice E) ¢-globin is a component of hemoglobin Gower, the initial hemoglobin formed by the
embryo very early in embryogenesis.

Educational Objective:

HbF contains y-globin instead of B-globin. Patients with homozygotic B-thalassemia (B-
thalassemia major) are asymptomatic at birth due to the presence of y-globins and HbF.
Switching to HbA production and the cessation of y-globin synthesis precipitates the
symptoms of B-thalassemia.
