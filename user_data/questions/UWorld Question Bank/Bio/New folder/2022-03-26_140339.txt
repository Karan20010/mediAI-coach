(Choice A) The Golgi apparatus is involved in posttranslational modification of proteins from
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. It also routes proteins to their ultimate location (eg,
lysosomes, extracellular space) using membrane-bound vesicles.

(Choice B) Lysosomes are organelles containing proteins that can digest a diverse range of
biomolecules, cellular debris, and engulfed pathogens. Lysosomal storage disorders (eg,
mucopolysaccharidoses, sphingolipidoses) result in intracellular accumulation of
glycosaminoglycans, glycoproteins, or glycolipids.

(Choice C) Mitochondria are responsible for beta-oxidation of most fatty acids, ketogenesis,
the TCA cycle and electron transport chain, and the first 2 steps of the urea cycle. Dysfunction
can lead to various types of encephalomyopathy. Mitochondria do not metabolize VLCFAs or
fatty acids with branch points at odd-numbered carbons.

(Choice E) Proteasomes degrade unneeded or defective intracellular proteins into small
polypeptides or amino acids. Impaired proteasome function can lead to cell cycle
dysregulation, protein aggregation, and defective processing of peptide antigens.

(Choice F) The rough endoplasmic reticulum is the site of synthesis for most secretory
proteins, integral membrane proteins of the nucleus and cell membrane, and lysosomal

proteins. PCEVENO
