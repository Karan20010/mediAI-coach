Acute facial flushing following accidental vitamin ingestion is highly suggestive of niacin
(vitamin B;) toxicity. Niacin is a water-soluble vitamin and the precursor for NAD
(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP, which are both cofactors for key enzymes
involved in the synthesis and metabolism of carbohydrates, protein, and fatty acids.

Niacin supplementation is effective in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. At high doses, niacin
increases the activity of lipoprotein lipase, which promotes delivery of fatty acids to tissues for
storage or metabolism. Adverse effects of niacin include cutaneous vasodilation, flushing,
and pruritus due to increased prostaglandin production in dermal Langerhans cells.
Pretreatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), like aspirin, prior to the
administration of niacin decreases prostaglandin production and minimizes flushing.

(Choice A) Thiamine (vitamin B,) is a coenzyme for transketolase in the pentose phosphate
pathway. Thiamine deficiency leads to wet beriberi (cardiac failure), dry beriberi (peripheral
neuropathy), and Wernicke encephalopathy (oculomotor dysfunction, ataxia, and
encephalopathy); clinically relevant toxicity does not occur.

(Choice B) Vitamin C is a coenzyme for the hydroxylation of prolyl and lysyl residues.
Vitamin C deficiency leads to scurvy (weakness, fatigue, easy bruising, bleeding gingivae).
