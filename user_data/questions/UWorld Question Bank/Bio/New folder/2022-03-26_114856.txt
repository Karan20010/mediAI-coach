A 34-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department in the early morning with
confusion, tremor, and sweating. Her husband reports that she did not wake to her alarm
clock and was difficult to arouse. Over the past week, the patient has had similar episodes in
the morning before eating and after exercise. Past medical history is unremarkable. Blood
pressure is 135/95 mm Hg, pulse is 110/min, and respirations are 24/min. The patient is
arousable to voice but does not follow commands. Cranial nerve examination, muscle tone,
and deep tendon reflexes are normal. A bedside fingerstick glucose level is 35 mg/dL. The
patient is given an intravenous infusion of glucose, which rapidly improves her mental status.
Further evaluation reveals that her episodes of hypoglycemia are due to increased levels of an
endogenous hormone. This hormonal imbalance is most likely causing the patient's symptoms
by stimulating which of the following conversions?
