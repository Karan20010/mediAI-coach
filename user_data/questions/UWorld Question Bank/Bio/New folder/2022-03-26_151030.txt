When excess ammonia is present in the blood, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken
up by astrocytes, increasing glutamine production. The presence of excess glutamine
within astrocytes leads to increased intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and
impaired glutamine release. Hyperammonemia consequently decreases the amount of
glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in neurons, resulting in disruption of
excitatory neurotransmission.
