Heme synthesis occurs partly in the mitochondria and partly in the cytoplasm of erythrocytes.
Mitochondria are necessary for the first and the final 3 steps. Erythrocyte precursors divide a
number of times before finally losing their nuclei and mitochondria and forming mature red
blood cells that survive for about 120 days (4 months). When erythrocytes lose their
mitochondria, they lose the ability to generate heme and therefore hemoglobin.

Heme is synthesized in virtually every organ, but the principal sites of synthesis are
erythrocyte precursor cells (located in the bone marrow) and hepatocytes (use heme in
microsomal cytochrome P450 system).

(Choices A, B, and D) Although mature erythrocytes do not contain a nucleus, a Golgi
apparatus, or an endoplasmic reticulum, their cytoplasm still contains residual amounts of the
enzymes necessary for heme synthesis. Therefore, the lack of mitochondria (and their
associated heme biosynthetic enzymes) is a better explanation for the lack of heme synthesis.

(Choices E and F) Proteasomes are involved in protein recycling and peroxisomes are
involved in fatty acid catabolism. These organelles typically disappear during erythrocyte
development.

Educational objective:

Maturing erythrocytes lose their ability to synthesize heme when they lose their mitochondria,
