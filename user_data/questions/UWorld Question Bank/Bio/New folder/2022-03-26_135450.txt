A 6-month-old boy is brought to the office by his mother out of concern that he is not
developing normally. He has been feeding regularly and has had no medical problems other
than a mild respiratory infection a month earlier. However, the mother says, "he doesn't seem
to be as interactive as my other children were at his age." Physical examination reveals
delayed developmental milestones and hypotonia. Two years later, the child is found to have

involuntary movements and demonstrates a tendency to aggressively bite his own lips and
fingers. Laboratory analysis shows an elevated blood uric acid level. Activity of which of the
