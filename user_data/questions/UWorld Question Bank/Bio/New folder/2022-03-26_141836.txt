Von Willebrand factor (vWF) is an important hemostatic glycoprotein (GP) synthesized by
endothelial cells and megakaryocytes. Following endothelial damage, vWF binds GP Ib
receptors on the platelet membrane and mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial
collagen. Deficiency of VWF impairs platelet adhesion and can lead to easy bruising and
prolonged mucocutaneous bleeding (eg, gingival bleeding, heavy menses).

Laboratory workup in vWF deficiency reveals a normal platelet count and an abnormal
ristocetin cofactor assay. The ristocetin cofactor assay measures in-vitro, vWF-dependent
platelet agglutination (indicative of impaired platelet adhesion in-vivo). Ristocetin activates GP
Ib receptors on platelets and makes them available for vWF binding; when the vWF level is
decreased, there is poor platelet agglutination in the presence of ristocetin. When normal
plasma that contains vWF is added, appropriate platelet agglutination occurs.

VWF also serves as a carrier for factor VIII to prolong its half-life, and vWF deficiency can
lead to functional deficiency of factor VIII that further contributes to bleeding complications.
PTT may be normal or prolonged depending on the degree of factor VIII impairment.

Combined oral contraceptives are often used for treatment of menorrhagia due to vWF
deficiency. Patients can also be treated with desmopressin, which stimulates vWF release
from endothelium.
