oxygen delivery from the maternal circulation to that of the fetus.

(Choice C) Hemoglobin A2 (a252) is a normal hemoglobin variant that makes up 2%-3% of
hemoglobin in a healthy adult and is functionally similar to Hb A. Patients with beta-
thalassemia major have impaired beta globin production, resulting in an excess of alpha globin
chains (eg, Hb A2, Hb F) and no HbA.

(Choices D and E) Alpha-thalassemia results from a shortage of alpha globin chains.
Hemoglobin H (84) and hemoglobin Barts (y4) have a very high oxygen affinity and cannot
release oxygen, resulting in tissue hypoxia. Hemoglobin H disease manifests as chronic
hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin Barts is incompatible with life (eg, hydrops fetalis) as normal
fetal and adult hemoglobin cannot be produced.

Educational objective:

Hemoglobin F (Hb F) is the predominant hemoglobin type in the second and third trimesters of
pregnancy and during the first few months after birth. Hb F consists of 2 alpha and 2 gamma
protein subunits (a2y2) and has a high affinity for oxygen, which facilitates oxygen transport
across the placenta to the fetus. Hb A (a2B2) is the major hemoglobin in adults.
