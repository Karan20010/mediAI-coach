Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) is an autosomal dominant disease
caused by defective DNA mismatch repair. DNA replication occurs with a high degree of
fidelity because mismatched nucleotides are repaired through the proofreading activity of DNA
polymerases delta and epsilon. However, this proofreading functionality is not infallible; base
substitutions and small insertion-deletion mismatches occur due to errors in base pairing every
10Â° bases on average. It is the function of the DNA mismatch repair system to fix these errors
shortly after the daughter strands are synthesized. The mismatch repair system involves
several genes, including MSH2 and MLH1, which code for components of the human MutS
and MutL homologs. Mutations in these 2 genes account for around 90% of cases of Lynch
syndrome.
