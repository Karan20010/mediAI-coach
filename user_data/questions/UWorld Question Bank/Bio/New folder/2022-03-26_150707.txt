Niacin can be obtained through dietary intake or synthesized endogenously from
tryptophan. In developing countries, niacin deficiency is seen in populations that subsist
primarily on corn products (niacin in corn occurs in a bound, unabsorbable form). In
developed countries, it is primarily seen in patients with impaired nutritional intake (eg, alcohol
use disorder, chronic illness). Pellagra can also be seen occasionally in those with carcinoid
syndrome, prolonged isoniazid therapy, or Hartnup disease.

(Choice A) Arginine is a nonessential amino acid and a precursor of nitric oxide, urea,
ornithine, and agmatine. It is also necessary for the formation of creatine.

(Choice B) Carotene is the precursor to vitamin A. Carotene deficiency may result in night
blindness and immune dysfunction.

(Choice C) Cholesterol is the precursor to steroid hormones.

(Choice D) Orotic acid is a precursor of pyrimidine. Hereditary orotic aciduria occurs due to
impairment of the enzyme uridine monophosphate synthetase, which synthesizes pyrimidines
from orotic acid. The accumulation of orotic acid leads to megaloblastic anemia,
developmental delay, and failure to thrive.
