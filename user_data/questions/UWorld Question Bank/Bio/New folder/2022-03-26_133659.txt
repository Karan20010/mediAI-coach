(Choice D) Reactive arthritis can occur following enteric or genitourinary infections with
organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Chlamydia. The typical pattern
is asymmetric involvement of lower extremity joints accompanied by enthesitis (inflammation at
insertion of tendons), conjunctivitis, and urethritis. Reactive arthritis has no associated skin
findings in contrast to alkaptonuria.

(Choice E) Albinism is caused by defects in biosynthesis and distribution of melanin.
Melanocytes synthesize melanin from tyrosine via the enzyme tyrosinase.

Educational objective:

Alkaptonuria is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of homogentisic acid
dioxygenase, an enzyme involved in tyrosine metabolism. Excess homogentisic acid causes
diffuse blue-black deposits in connective tissues. Adults have sclerae and ear cartilage
hyperpigmentation along with osteoarthropathy of the spine and large joints.
