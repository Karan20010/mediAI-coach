(Choices A, B, and C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency causes
the most severe and most common form of galactosemia. Symptoms occur within the first few
days of life after initiation of breastfeeding or formula and include vomiting, jaundice,
hepatomegaly, and lethargy. Excess galactose is converted to galactitol by aldose reductase,
resulting in cataracts from excess galactitol deposition in the lens. Galactokinase deficiency is
a less common type of galactosemia, causing cataract formation only.

(Choice D) Lactose synthase converts UDP-galactose to lactose within the mammary glands
during milk formation. Deficiency of this enzyme does not result in lactose malabsorption.

Educational objective:

Secondary lactase deficiency can occur after inflammatory (eg, celiac disease) or infectious
(eg, giardiasis) processes damage the microvilli of the small intestines. Clinical presentation
includes abdominal distension and cramping, flatulence, and diarrhea.
