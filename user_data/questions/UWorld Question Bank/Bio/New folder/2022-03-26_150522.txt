promote black pigment stone formation.
(Choice A) Inhibition of 7-alpha-hydroxylase (eg, fibrates) reduces the conversion of
cholesterol to bile acids and increases the risk of cholesterol stones. However, this patient's
gallstones are composed primarily of unconjugated bilirubin, not cholesterol.

(Choices B and E) Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen, which
increases hepatic cholesterol uptake. In addition, estrogens upregulate HMG Co-A reductase,
which increases cholesterol synthesis. This increases biliary excretion of cholesterol, favoring
formation of cholesterol stones, not pigment stones.

(Choice D) Desmolase (cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) catalyzes the conversion of
cholesterol to pregnenolone, which is the first step in the synthesis of steroid hormones.

Educational objective:

Brown pigment gallstones are composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin and arise
secondary to bacterial or helminthic infection of the biliary tract. Beta-glucuronidase released
by injured hepatocytes and bacteria hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides to unconjugated
bilirubin. The liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis has a high prevalence in East Asian countries and
is a common cause of pigment stones.
