(Choice A) In the lungs, chloride ions shift out of red blood cells and into the plasma in
exchange for HCO... These chloride ions are not bound to or released by hemoglobin.
(Choice B) Heme is not released from hemoglobin during O, loading or unloading. However,
it is released during the normal destruction of aged red blood cells in the spleen.

(Choice C) O, molecules bind to hemoglobin to increase hemoglobin saturation.

(Choice D) 2,3-diphosphoglycerate contains 2 phosphate groups and binds to hemoglobin to
facilitate unloading of O, in the tissues. However, phosphate molecules are not directly bound
or released by hemoglobin.

Educational objective:

The binding of O, to hemoglobin increases the affinity for binding of subsequent O, molecules
(cooperative binding). In the lungs, the binding of O, to hemoglobin drives the release of H-
and CO, from hemoglobin (Haldane effect). In the peripheral tissues, high concentrations of

CO, and H:- facilitate O, unloading from hemoglobin (Bohr effect).
