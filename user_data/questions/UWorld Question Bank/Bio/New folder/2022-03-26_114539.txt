(Choice A) Troponin (but not calmodulin) is responsible for contraction of both cardiac and
skeletal muscle. Unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is affected by verapamil due to its
dependence on extracellular calcium to induce calcium release from the sarcoplasmic
reticulum.

(Choice B) Arise in intracellular calcium concentration results in a structural change in the
troponin complex that allows actin and myosin to interact and cause skeletal muscle
contraction. Calcium channel blockers do not affect troponin's affinity to intracellular calcium.

(Choice C) An elaborate T tubule system is present in skeletal and cardiac muscle but not in
smooth muscle. T tubules are a communication of the extracellular space that allows the
depolarization impulse to reach deep into the cell, nearer to the myofilaments. They are in
close proximity to the sarcoplasmic reticulum and therefore facilitate rapid release of
intracellular calcium stores.

(Choice D) Unlike cardiac myocytes and specialized smooth muscle tissue (eg,
gastrointestinal tract, ureters), skeletal muscle does not display automaticity and contracts only
in response to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. However, the mechanical coupling between
L-type and RyR calcium channels is responsible for skeletal muscle's resistance to verapamil.
