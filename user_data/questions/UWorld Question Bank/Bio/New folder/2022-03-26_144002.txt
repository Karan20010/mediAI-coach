This patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is a
hemoglobinopathy that typically affects patients of African ancestry. A point mutation in the 6"
codon of the beta-globin gene, which causes the substitution of valine (hydrophobic) for
glutamic acid (hydrophilic), is responsible. The incorporation of this abnormal beta-globin
protein into hemoglobin results in the formation of hemoglobin S (HbS). HbS polymerizes at
low oxygen tension, causing sickling and hemolysis of erythrocytes and resultant vascular
occlusion. This patient's poor exercise tolerance and exertional dyspnea are due to anemia.
His history of acute chest syndrome, abdominal pain, and bone pain are due to vaso-occlusive
events in the lungs, spleen and bone, respectively.
