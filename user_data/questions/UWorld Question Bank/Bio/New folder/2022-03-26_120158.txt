protein synthesis (translation).

(Choices A and D) Polyadenylation of RNA transcripts is performed by the enzyme
polyadenylate polymerase. This process stabilizes mRNA, helping it exit the nucleus.

(Choices B and F) During eukaryotic DNA replication, DNA polymerase 6 elongates Okazaki
fragments of the lagging strand. These Okazaki fragments are later joined by the enzyme
DNA ligase.

(Choice C) During translation, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases catalyze the linkage of tRNAs to
their corresponding amino acids. Each enzyme recognizes a specific amino acid and all of the
tRNAs that match that amino acid.

Educational objective:

Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is synthesized by RNA polymerase II in the nucleus and
complexes with specific proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). snRNPs
are an essential component of spliceosomes, which remove introns from pre-mRNA to form
mature MRNA. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus can have autoantibodies directed
against snRNPs (eg, anti-Smith antibody).
