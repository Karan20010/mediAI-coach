Multiple metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced tissue
damage:

Â¢ Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs): Glucose can nonenzymatically attach
to proteins and lipids, forming reversible glycosylation products that slowly stabilize into
irreversible products. Under hyperglycemic conditions, AGEs accumulate and facilitate
deposition of LDL in blood vessel walls and inflammatory cell invasion that causes
atherosclerosis and microangiopathic complications. High glucose levels in the aqueous
humor may also induce nonenzymatic glycation of lens proteins, which contributes to
cataract formation.

Polyol pathway overactivity: The enzyme aldose reductase converts glucose to
sorbitol, which is then oxidized to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. With
hyperglycemia, formation of sorbitol occurs faster than its metabolism to fructose, resulting
in its accumulation. Sorbitol increases the osmotic pressure in tissues and stimulates the
influx of water, leading to osmotic cellular injury. In addition, oxidative stress resulting
from the depletion of NADPH (aldose reductase consumes NADPH) also contributes to
cataract formation and other diabetic complications such as retinopathy, peripheral
neuropathy, and nephropathy.
