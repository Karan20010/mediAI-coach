blood oxygen concentrations, higher 2,3-BPG levels within erythrocytes enable increased

oxygen delivery in the peripheral tissues.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) The enzyme bisphosphoglycerate mutase is present in large
amounts in erythrocytes. However, it is present in insignificant quantities in adipocytes,
hepatocytes, neurons, and myocytes; this causes virtually negligible 2,3-BPG production in
these cell types.

Educational objective:

2,3-BPG decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. Therefore, in the presence of lower
blood oxygen concentrations, higher 2,3-BPG levels within erythrocytes enable increased
oxygen delivery in the peripheral tissues. 2,3-BPG is produced from 1,3-BPG by the enzyme
bisphosphoglycerate mutase. This reaction bypasses an ATP-generating step of glycolysis,
causing no net gain in ATP.

the Rapoport-Luebering glycolytic shunt.
