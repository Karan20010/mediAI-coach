A 34-year-old woman comes to the office after her sister was diagnosed with breast cancer.
She has no nipple discharge, breast lumps, or discomfort. Breast examination is normal. Her
sister was found to have a multiple base pair insertion affecting exon 11 of the BRCA71 gene
that leads to a frameshift mutation. A screening test to evaluate for a similar insertion mutation
in the patient's BRCA7 gene is performed. The test uses polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to
amplify the target exon and gel electrophoresis to assess the size of the exon compared to the
wild-type allele. Which of the following must be known in order to perform the amplification
part of this analysis?

© A. Restriction enzyme susceptibility sites within the target exon
©) B. The amino acid sequence of the abnormal BRCA1 protein
© C. The cDNA nucleotide sequence

©) D. The complete nucleotide sequence of the target exon

() E. The nucleotide sequence of the regions flanking the target exon
