(Choice A) Krabbe disease (galactocerebroside accumulation) is a lysosomal storage
disease that causes progressive neurodegeneration. However, affected infants have optic
atrophy, which is visualized as optic nerve pallor rather than a bright red fovea.

(Choice B) Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which glucocerebroside

it accumulation results in bone pain, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow suppression (eg,
anemia, thrombocytopenia). This patient's normal abdominal examination and bright red fovea
14 makes Gaucher disease unlikely.

16 (Choice D) Mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome) are lysosomal
storage disorders characterized by the build-up of glycosaminoglycans such as heparan and
19 dermatan sulfate. Patients have neurocognitive decline, but coarse facial features and
hepatosplenomegaly are also expected. Although Hurler syndrome is associated with corneal
22 clouding, neither mucopolysaccharidosis causes a cherry-red macula.

24 (Choice E) Neurodegeneration and a cherry-red macular spot occur in Niemann-Pick
disease, which is characterized by sphingomyelin accumulation. However,
27 hepatosplenomegaly would be present and is not seen here.
