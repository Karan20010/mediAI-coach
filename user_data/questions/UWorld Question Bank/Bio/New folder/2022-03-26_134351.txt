Stress hyperglycemia is a transiently elevated blood glucose level in the context of severe
illness in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus. It is common in the intensive care unit
and is typically seen in those with sepsis and other severe infections, burns, trauma, or major
hemorrhage.

Severe metabolic stress is associated with increased production of cortisol, catecholamines
(primarily epinephrine and norepinephrine), glucagon, and proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1,
IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon act on the liver to
increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, stimulating release of glucose from the liver
into the blood.

In addition, the release of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with increased expression
of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 in the CNS and macrophages, along with decreased
expression of GLUT4 (which mediates insulin-induced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues).
This facilitates increased glucose uptake by the brain and immune cells responsible for
fighting infection.
