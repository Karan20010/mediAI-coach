This patient's autopsy shows foci of hemorrhage and necrosis in the mammillary bodies and
periaqueductal gray matter, findings characteristic of Wernicke encephalopathy. This
condition classically presents with the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and confusion but can
lead to coma and death if untreated. Wernicke encephalopathy occurs due to chronic thiamine
deficiency, which is common in patients with alcohol use disorder.
