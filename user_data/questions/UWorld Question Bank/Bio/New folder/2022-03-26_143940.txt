isoniazid.
(Choice A) 6-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase is another enzyme involved in heme synthesis.

Lead poisoning can cause anemia by directly inhibiting this enzyme. However, pyridoxine is
not a cofactor for this step; therefore, isoniazid would not affect its activity.

(Choice C) Cystathionine synthase catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from

iB homocysteine. Deficiency results in homocystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by a marfanoid body habitus and hypercoagulability. Although cystathionine
as synthase is a pyridoxine-dependent enzyme, impairment does not result in sideroblastic
v7 anemia.

(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency results in increased red
+ 20 blood cell susceptibility to oxidative stress (eg, infection, medication, fava beans), which
triggers hemolysis. This results in a normocytic, normochromic, hemolytic anemia without ring
23 sideroblasts.

28 (Choice E) Pyruvate kinase deficiency, an autosomal recessive disorder, results in a
normocytic, normochromic, hemolytic anemia without ring sideroblasts.
