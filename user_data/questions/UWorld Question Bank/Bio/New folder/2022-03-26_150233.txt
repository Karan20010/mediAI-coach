An investigator is studying weight regulation using experimental mouse models. Knockout
mice are created with a homozygous mutation in the gene coding for the leptin receptor. This
mutation prevents the receptor from binding leptin and initiating its normal signaling cascade.
The knockout mice are allowed to feed at will, and their body mass index (BMI) and serum
leptin levels are measured and compared with control mice. On the graph below, area C
represents the normal relationship between BMI and leptin in a control mouse.
