In adults, hemoglobin A is the predominant form of hemoglobin. It is a tetramer consisting of
two alpha and two beta chains. Normally the synthesis of alpha and beta chains is tightly
regulated such that one a-chain is synthesized for every B-chain. Hemoglobin formation
begins within a few weeks of conception. The initial hemoglobin formed by a fetus in utero is
called embryonic hemoglobin (Gower). This hemoglobin is composed of two zeta (¢) and two
epsilon (€) chains (¢2€2) and is produced in the embryonic yolk sac. Within a few weeks the
fetal liver starts synthesizing hemoglobin F (fetal hemoglobin). This form of hemoglobin is
composed of two alpha and two gamma chains (a2y2). HbF is the major hemoglobin in the
fetus during last few months of gestation and in infants during first few weeks of postnatal life.
HbA synthesis starts during the final month of gestation and gradually replaces HbF during
postnatal life. Knowing the chronology of fetal hemoglobin formation and the gradual transition
to adult hemoglobin (HbA) is important in understanding the relationship between clinical
manifestations and postnatal age in beta thalassemia.
