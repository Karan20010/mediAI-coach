(Choice A) Niacin deficiency is characterized by pellagra (ie, dementia, dermatitis, diarrhea).
Papilledema and hepatomegaly are not seen.

(Choice B) Thiamine deficiency is associated with beriberi (ie, peripheral neuropathy, heart
failure) as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (ie, confusion, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia) in
patients with alcohol use disorder.

(Choice D) Vitamin B,, (cobalamin) deficiency is frequently associated with pernicious
anemia, which typically presents with pale yellow skin (due to anemia and jaundice) in addition

to a smooth, shiny tongue (ie, atrophic glossitis) and a shuffling, broad-based gait.

(Choice E) Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), not toxicity, is associated with dry skin; excessive
vitamin C can cause headache and gastrointestinal upset. Hepatomegaly and papilledema
would not be expected with abnormal vitamin C levels.

(Choice F) Large doses of vitamin E are associated with an increased risk of bleeding (eg,
hemorrhagic stroke).
