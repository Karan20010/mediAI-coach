This patient with microcytic anemia that improved with vitamin B, (pyridoxine) but not iron
supplementation likely has X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). XLSAis an X-linked
recessive disorder affecting 5-aminolevulinate synthase. This enzyme, with vitamin B, as a
cofactor, catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in porphyrin synthesis in which glycine and
succinyl CoA form aminolevulinic acid.

Porphyrin combines with iron to form heme, which then combines with alpha- and beta-globin
to form hemoglobin. In XLSA, impaired porphyrin synthesis leads to ineffective
erythropoiesis as sufficient amounts of hemoglobin cannot be synthesized. As a result,
patients develop microcytic anemia with an increased red blood cell distribution width and an
inappropriately normal or low reticulocyte count. The anemia improves with vitamin

B, supplementation, which enhances the function of the defective 5-aminolevulinate synthase.

Vitamin B, deficiency or isoniazid therapy (acts as a competitive inhibitor of vitamin B,) may

induce sideroblastic anemia by impairing the function of 5-aminolevulinate synthase.
