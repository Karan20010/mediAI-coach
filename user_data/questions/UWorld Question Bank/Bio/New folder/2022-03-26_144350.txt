This patient most likely has familial erythrocytosis due to a B-globin mutation resulting in
reduced binding of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG). 2,3-BPG is synthesized from
glycolytic intermediates and binds strongly to deoxyhemoglobin in a pocket formed between
the 2 beta chains. This binding reduces the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, allowing more
oxygen to diffuse into the peripheral tissues. The hemoglobin 2,3-BPG binding pocket
contains positively charged amino acids (eg, histidine and lysine) that attract the negatively
charged phosphate groups in 2,3-BPG. Mutations that decrease the positive charge of the
binding site decrease 2,3-BPG binding and increase hemoglobin oxygen affinity.

Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) is synthesized primarily during fetal development (~8
weeks until term) and consists of the usual 2 alpha chains with 2 gamma chains in place of
beta chains. The gamma chains do not bind effectively to 2,3-BPG due to replacement of a
histidine residue with serine. As a result, fetal hemoglobin has significantly higher oxygen
affinity than adult hemoglobin A. This allows fetal hemoglobin to extract more oxygen from the
mother's adult hemoglobin in the placenta, providing the developing fetus with an adequate
supply of oxygen.
