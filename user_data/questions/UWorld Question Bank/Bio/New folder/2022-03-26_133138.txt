The Southern, Western, Northern, and Southwestern blot procedures are powerful techniques
used to analyze and identify DNA fragments, proteins, mRNA, and DNA-bound proteins,
respectively. The same basic technique underlies all of the blot procedures. First, the
unknown sample is separated by gel electrophoresis. Separation occurs based ona
molecule's size and charge. The separated molecules form bands on the gel that are then
blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with a labeled probe to identify the
specific DNA fragment, RNA molecule, or protein of interest.

Southwestern blots are used to identify and isolate proteins that bind DNA. In this technique,
the target protein binds to a labeled, double-stranded DNA probe that is homologous to the
proteinâ€™s regulatory sequence. Of the molecules listed, c-Jun is the only DNA-binding protein.
c-Jun and c-Fos are nuclear transcription factors that directly bind DNA via a leucine zipper
motif. The genes that code for c-Jun and c-Fos are proto-oncogenes, genes that can become
oncogenes following a mutation or with constitutive expression.
