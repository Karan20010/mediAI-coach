Peroxisomal disorders are rare inborn errors of metabolism in which peroxisomes are either
absent or nonfunctional. Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and certain branched-chain
fatty acids (eg, phytanic acid) cannot undergo mitochondrial beta-oxidation; these fatty acids
are metabolized by a special form of beta-oxidation (VLCFAs) or by alpha-oxidation (branched-
chain fatty acids) within peroxisomes. In peroxisomal disorders, these fatty acids build up in
various tissues. Accumulation in neuronal cell membranes leads to neurologic defects due
to improper neuronal migration, myelination, and degeneration.

This infant most likely has Zellweger syndrome, which is caused by defective peroxisomal
biogenesis. It typically presents in early infancy with craniofacial abnormalities (eg, widened
sutures, large anterior fontanelle), hepatomegaly, and profound neurologic defects (eg,
hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay). Death usually occurs within months of initial
presentation.

Another common peroxisomal disease is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which is
characterized by defective transport of VLCFAs into peroxisomes. Patients present in
childhood or adulthood with neurologic deterioration and adrenal insufficiency as VLCFAs
accumulate in the central nervous system and adrenal glands.
