Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder. It is caused by
a deficiency of sphingomyelinase, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing sphingomyelin
(a phospholipid) to ceramide.

Excess sphingomyelin results in cells that appear enlarged, foamy, and vacuolated on electron
microscopy. These lipid-laden foam cells accumulate in the liver (hepatomegaly), spleen
(splenomegaly), and CNS (hypotonia, neurodegeneration). After a period of normal
development, affected infants do not attain new skills and regress from previously acquired
milestones (eg, sitting with support, head control, social smile). Accumulation of
sphingomyelin in the retinal ganglion cells also leads to retinal opacification, which gives the
appearance of a cherry-red macula. Disease is progressive, and death usually occurs by age
3.

Niemann-Pick disease, like several other rare genetic disorders (eg, Tay-Sachs disease,
Gaucher disease, Bloom syndrome), is more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population
than in the general population. The increased risk for rare and often life-threatening genetic
mutations is attributed to the founder effect, or the loss of genetic variability within a group that
historically conceived within their own community. An Ashkenazi Jewish couple should be
offered genetic counseling and testing before they conceive a child.
