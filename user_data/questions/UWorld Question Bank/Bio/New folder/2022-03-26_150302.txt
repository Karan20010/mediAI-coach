is thought that the sustained elevation in leptin levels from the enlarged fat stores results in
leptin desensitization. Thus, obese individuals become resistant to the effects of leptin in a
manner similar to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes.

(Choice D) Low leptin and low BMI correlate with low adipocyte stores and may be seen after

prolonged starvation.

(Choice E) With intact receptor signaling, elevated leptin levels (ie, from exogenous leptin
administration) would result in weight loss.

Educational objective:

Leptin is a protein hormone produced by adipocytes in proportion to the quantity of fat stored.
Leptin acts on the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus to inhibit production of neuropeptide Y
(decreasing appetite) and stimulate production of alpha-MSH (increasing satiety). Mutations in
the leptin gene or receptor result in hyperphagia and profound obesity.
