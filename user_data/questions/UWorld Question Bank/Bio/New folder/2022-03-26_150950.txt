This patient has hepatic encephalopathy, likely due to his recent gastrointestinal bleeding
causing a corresponding increase in nitrogen absorption by the gut. The pathogenesis of
hepatic encephalopathy is related to increased circulatory levels of ammonia and other
neurotoxins due to failure of the liver to metabolize waste products.

Under normal conditions, astrocytes regulate neurotransmission by taking up glutamate
present in the synapse, preventing excessive neuronal excitation. Through the action of
glutamine synthetase, glutamate undergoes a condensation reaction with ammonia to form
glutamine (a non-neuroactive compound). Glutamine is then released by the astrocytes and
taken up by neurons, where it is converted back to glutamate for use as a neurotransmitter

(glutamate-glutamine cycle).

When excess ammonia is present in the blood, it crosses the blood-brain barrier and is taken
up by astrocytes, increasing glutamine production. The presence of excess glutamine
within astrocytes leads to increased intracellular osmolarity, causing astrocyte swelling and
impaired glutamine release. Hyperammonemia consequently decreases the amount of
glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in neurons, resulting in disruption of
excitatory neurotransmission.
