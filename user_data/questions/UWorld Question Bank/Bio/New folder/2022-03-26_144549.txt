Educational objective:

Hemoglobin C is caused by a missense mutation that results in a glutamate residue being
substituted by lysine in the beta globin chain. This results in an overall decrease in negative
charge for the hemoglobin molecule. The speed of hemoglobin movement during gel
electrophoresis is hemoglobin A > hemoglobin S > hemoglobin C.
