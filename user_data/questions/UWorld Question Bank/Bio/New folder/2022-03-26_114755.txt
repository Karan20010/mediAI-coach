(Choices D and E) Helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork. However, this process
results in supercoiling of the DNA. DNA gyrase is a type II topoisomerase that helps to relieve
the resultant strain.

Educational objective:
Primase is a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase that incorporates short RNA primers into
replicating DNA.
