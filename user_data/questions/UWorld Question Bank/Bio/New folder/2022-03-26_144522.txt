Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to assess for different forms of hemoglobin in patients with
suspected hemoglobinopathy. Normal hemoglobin consists primarily of hemoglobin A (HbA),
which migrates rapidly toward the positive electrode (anode) because of its negative charge.
Hemoglobin S (HbS) is an abnormal type of hemoglobin in which a nonpolar amino acid
(valine) replaces a negatively charged amino acid (glutamate) in the beta globin chain. This
amino acid replacement decreases the negative charge on the HbS molecule, which causes
HbS to move more slowly toward the anode. Similarly, hemoglobin C (HbC) has a glutamate
residue replaced by lysine in the beta globin chain. Because lysine is a positively charged
amino acid, HbC has even less total negative charge than HbS and moves even more slowly
toward the anode. Both HbC and HbS result from missense mutations, a type of mutation in
which a single base substitution results in a codon that codes for a different amino acid.

Patients with sickle cell disease have HbS mutations in both beta chains; those with HbC
disease have HbC mutations involving both beta chains. Patients with hemoglobin SC disease
have 1 HbS allele and 1 HbC allele and will have 2 hemoglobin bands on electrophoresis.

This patient's electrophoresis results show a single band that migrates less than the HbA
and HbS bands, meaning that he has HbC disease. Patients with HbC disease are typically
asymptomatic and often have mild hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly.
