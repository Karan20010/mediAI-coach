This patient with neurologic symptoms (eg, tingling, difficulty concentrating) and recurrent
episodes of nonspecific abdominal pain likely has acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an
autosomal dominant disease characterized by porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase
deficiency. Management of AIP attacks includes infusion of hemin, which downregulates
hepatic aminolevulinate (ALA) synthase (rate-limiting enzyme in hepatic pathway of heme
synthesis).

Heme, a porphyrin, is synthesized in the liver for use in the cytochrome p450 enzyme system
and in the bone marrow for hemoglobin use (these 2 synthesis pathways are regulated
differently). A deficiency in any of the enzymes responsible for porphyrin synthesis can result
in porphyria. Clinical manifestations result from the accumulation of porphyrin precursors in
blood, tissues, and urine. AIP attacks, which are characterized by acute abdominal pain and
neurologic symptoms, are due to accumulation of ALA and PBG, generally resulting from a
combination of 2 factors:

Â¢ PBG deaminase deficiency (inherited)

e ALAsynthase induction, typically precipitated by certain medications (eg, phenobarbital,
griseofulvin, phenytoin), alcohol use, smoking, progesterone (eg, puberty), or a low-calorie
diet (as seen with this patient)
