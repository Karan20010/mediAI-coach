Educational objective:

Dietary fructose is phosphorylated in the liver to F1P and is rapidly metabolized because it
bypasses PFK-1, the major rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. Other sugars (eg, glucose,
galactose, mannose) enter glycolysis prior to PFK-1 and as a result are metabolized more

slowly.
