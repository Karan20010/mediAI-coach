glossitis but not perifollicular/subperiosteal hemorrhage.

(Choice B) Vitamin B, (niacin) deficiency, or pellagra, is characterized by dermatitis,

dementia, and diarrhea. Bleeding symptoms are not seen.

(Choices C, E, and G) Vitamin B, (pyridoxine) and B,, (cobalamin) deficiencies may cause
peripheral neuropathy that leads to difficulty walking. Similarly, vitamin D deficiency can cause
difficulty walking but due to osteomalacia and bone pain. None of these conditions are
associated with the subperiosteal and perifollicular hemorrhages seen in this patient.

(Choice D) Vitamin B, (biotin) deficiency may cause difficulty walking that would be due to a
neurologic deficit (eg, ataxia, paresthesias), not subperiosteal hematomas. Moreover, other
typical findings include perioral dermatitis, conjunctivitis, and alopecia, none of which are seen
in this patient.

(Choice H) Vitamin K deficiency leads to impaired synthesis of coagulation factors, most
commonly causing easy bruising and mucosal bleeding. In contrast to this case, gingivitis
(swollen, tender gums) would not be seen. Moreover, the perifollicular hemorrhages seen in
this patient are more specific for scurvy because they represent capillary fragility, not impaired
