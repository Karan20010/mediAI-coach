The 2 most important factors in osteoclast differentiation are macrophage colony-stimulating
factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L), which
stimulate the development of mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. The interaction of RANK-L
with RANK (receptor) is blocked by osteoprotegerin (OPG), which acts as a decoy receptor.
By binding RANK-L, OPG reduces the differentiation and survival of osteoclasts, resulting in
decreased bone resorption and increased bone density. Bone turnover is therefore regulated
by the ratio of OPG to RANK-L; bone turnover increases when OPG is low and RANK-L is
high.

Estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women by inducing the production of OPG
by osteoblasts and stromal cells. It also decreases the expression of RANK on osteoclast
precursors. By contrast, the loss of estrogen effect (eg, menopause, oophorectomy)
increases the expression of RANK-L and decreases production of OPG (Choice E). The
decreased OPG to RANK-L ratio leads to increased osteoclast activity and bone resorption.
Denosumab is a monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
It works in a manner similar to OPG by binding RANK-L and blocking its interaction with
RANK.
