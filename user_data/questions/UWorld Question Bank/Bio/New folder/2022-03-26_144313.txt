RAN

(Choices A and C) RANK is not present on osteoblasts, so the decreased OPG to RANK-L
ratio seen following oophorectomy does not affect bone mineralization or osteoid formation.

(Choice B) Osteocytes are derived from osteoblasts. Estrogen reduces osteoblast and
osteocyte apoptosis through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases rather than
effects on RANK/RANK-L.

Educational objective:

The receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANK-L) interaction is
essential for the formation and differentiation of osteoclasts. Osteoprotegerin blocks binding of
RANK-L to RANK and reduces formation of mature osteoclasts. Low estrogen states cause
osteoporosis by decreasing osteoprotegerin production, increasing RANK-L production, and
increasing RANK expression in osteoclast precursors.
