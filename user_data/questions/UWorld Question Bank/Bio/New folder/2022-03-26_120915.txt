(Choices B and C) Another function of aldose reductase is the conversion of galactose into
galactitol (ie, this enzyme converts sugars into their corresponding sugar alcohols). Galactitol
production via this pathway is normally insignificant. In galactosemia (galactose-1-phosphate
uridyltransferase deficiency), an increased amount of galactitol is produced, resulting in
congenital cataracts.

(Choice D) The end product of sorbitol metabolism in most cells is fructose (not glucose),
which is then excreted by the cells and taken up by the liver to produce glucose and
triglycerides.

(Choice E) Xylulose is an intermediate in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is used to
generate NADPH (for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis) and ribose 5-phosphate (for
nucleotide synthesis).

Educational objective:

In the polyol pathway, aldose reductase converts glucose into sorbitol, which is slowly

metabolized into fructose by sorbitol dehydrogenase. Chronic hyperglycemia overwhelms this

pathway, causing intracellular sorbitol accumulation and increased osmotic/oxidative stress.

This accelerates cataract development in patients with diabetes, and contributes to the

pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Activate Windows
