The 3 main circulating catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.
Norepinephrine and dopamine are produced in the central as well as the peripheral nervous
system, whereas epinephrine is predominantly produced in the adrenal medulla. The first
step in the synthesis of catecholamines is the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine
(DOPA) by tyrosine hydroxylase. This is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of
catecholamines. DOPA is converted to dopamine by dopa decarboxylase (Choice B), which is
then converted to norepinephrine by dopamine beta-hydroxylase (Choice C). In the adrenal
medulla, norepinephrine is rapidly converted to epinephrine by phenylethanolamine-N-
methyltransferase (PNMT).

Expression of PNMT in the adrenal medulla is upregulated by cortisol. Because the venous
drainage of the adrenal cortex passes through the adrenal medulla, cortisol concentrations in
the medulla can be very high, and PNMT is expressed at a high level. However, following
pituitary resection, the loss of ACTH leads to decreased synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal
cortex. The result is decreased PNMT activity and reduced conversion of norepinephrine to
epinephrine.
