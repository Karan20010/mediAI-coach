Vitamin A toxicity can be categorized as acute, chronic, or teratogenic:
¢ Acute: A single high dose can cause nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and blurred vision.

¢ Chronic (most common): Long-term ingestion of excessive vitamin A can lead to
increased intracranial pressure (ie, benign intracranial hypertension). Other nonspecific
symptoms include increased bone resorption (eg, osteoporosis, fractures) as well as
alopecia and dry skin and mucous membranes. Because vitamin A is stored in the liver,
hypervitaminosis A is hepatotoxic and can cause elevated aminotransferases,
hepatomegaly, and liver fibrosis.

¢ Teratogenic: Excessive first trimester intake can cause neural crest cell toxicity, resulting
in fetal microcephaly, craniofacial defects, cardiac anomalies, and death.

Discontinuation of medications containing vitamin A and limiting dietary intake typically
reverses the symptoms of hypervitaminosis A.
