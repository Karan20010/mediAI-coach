This patient with latent tuberculosis has laboratory values and bone marrow aspirate findings
consistent with sideroblastic anemia due to isoniazid use.

Sideroblastic anemia is caused by impaired heme production within red blood cells. When
iron is transported to developing erythrocytes that cannot form heme, iron granules
accumulate in mitochondria circumferentially around the nucleus, forming ring sideroblasts
that can be seen on Prussian blue-stained bone marrow aspirate. Etiologies include X-linked
sideroblastic anemia (due to an 6-aminolevulinic acid synthase mutation), myelodysplastic
syndrome, alcohol use disorder, copper deficiency, and certain medications (eg, isoniazid,
chloramphenicol, linezolid).

Isoniazid directly inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine phosphokinase, which normally converts
pyridoxine (vitamin B,) to its active form, pyridoxal 5' phosphate. Pyridoxine is a cofactor for
5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in
heme synthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme impairs heme production and erythroid development
to produce a microcytic anemia. Pyridoxine deficiency can also lead to seborrheic dermatitis,
glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, pyridoxine is typically prescribed with
isoniazid.
