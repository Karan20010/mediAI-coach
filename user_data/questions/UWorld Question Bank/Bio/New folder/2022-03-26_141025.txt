(Choices A and B) The presence of 2,3-biphosphoglycerate causes a right shift in the
oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, decreasing hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen and
increasing its affinity for carbon dioxide.

(Choice C) Hemoglobin has a much higher affinity for carbon monoxide than it does for
oxygen. This is the basis for carbon monoxide poisoning, which is treated with high-flow
oxygen.

(Choice E) The affinity of hemoglobin for iron is not affected by nitrite administration, although
nitrites do oxidize the heme iron to its Fe state.

(Choice F) Lead poisoning causes defective heme synthesis. If lead is acutely ingested,
chelation therapy with dimercaprol or edetate disodium calcium (CaNa,EDTA) should be
initiated.

Educational objective:

Nitrites are oxidizing agents that are effective in treating cyanide poisoning due to their ability
to induce methemoglobinemia. Methemoglobin contains ferric (Fe-) rather than ferrous iron
(Fe). Cyanide binds to ferric iron more avidly than to mitochondrial cytochrome enzymes,

diminishing cyanide's toxic effect. Activate Windows
