This patient with perifollicular hemorrhages, gingivitis, and subperiosteal hematomas likely has
vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). This condition is rare in resource-rich countries but can occur
in patients who are malnourished; children with autism, as in this case, are at increased risk
due to a higher likelihood of self-restrictive diets that lack vitamin C—rich foods (eg,
vegetables, citrus fruits).

Vitamin C is a cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine during collagen synthesis.
Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are essential for the spontaneous cross-linking of collagen
molecules. Vitamin C deficiency impairs collagen cross-linking, compromising tensile strength,
particularly in the skin and vascular walls. Increased vascular wall fragility leads to:

¢ Perifollicular hemorrhages
e Petechiae/ecchymoses
¢ Periodontal disease (gingival erythema/edema/bleeding)

¢ Intramuscular or subperiosteal hemorrhages, especially in the lower extremities due to
increased hydrostatic pressure. This results in pain and difficulty with ambulation,
which may be the presenting symptoms in children.
