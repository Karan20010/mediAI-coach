Educational objective:

Hyperammonemia in advanced liver failure occurs as a direct result of the cirrhotic liver's
inability to metabolize nitrogenous waste products. Ammonia crosses the blood-brain barrier
and causes excess glutamine to accumulate within astrocytes. This decreases the amount of
glutamine available for conversion to glutamate in the neurons, resulting in disruption of
excitatory neurotransmission.
