A 61-year-old man is brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive on
a sidewalk. Paramedics noted that the patient's breath smelled of alcohol and that he had
vomitus in his mouth. The patient also has agonal respirations, and cardiac monitoring shows
pulseless electrical activity. Resuscitation efforts are unsuccessful, and he is pronounced
dead on arrival. Autopsy shows that the cause of death is airway occlusion by aspirated
vomitus. In addition, foci of hemorrhage and necrosis are seen in the mammillary bodies and
gray matter surrounding the third and fourth ventricles. This patient's brain findings are most
likely associated with a decrease in which of the following?
