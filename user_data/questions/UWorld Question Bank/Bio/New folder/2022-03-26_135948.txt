This patient's loss of motor skills, excessive startle response, and ophthalmic findings are most
likely due to Tay-Sachs disease, an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder
commonly seen in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Tay-Sachs is caused by B-
hexosaminidase A deficiency, which results in lysosomal accumulation of GM2 ganglioside,
a glycolipid component of cell membranes.

Infants with Tay-Sachs disease typically develop normally for the first few months of life

because the gradual build-up of ganglioside in neuronal lysosomes does not initially cause
cellular dysfunction. However, by age 6 months the accumulation of glycolipids in the brain
results in neuronal destruction. Subsequent neurologic degeneration typically manifests as
developmental regression, as seen in this patient who is no longer able to sit or roll over.

Progressive destruction of neurons in the brain and spinal cord leads to macrocephaly,
seizures, and spasticity; an exaggerated startle reflex with acoustic stimuli is the result of
brainstem injury. Ganglioside accumulation also occurs in the retina but spares the fovea,
which lacks ganglion cells. This leads to the characteristic funduscopic finding of a cherry-red
macular spot, or a bright red unaffected fovea (which reflects the underlying choroid) that is
accentuated due to surrounding opacification of the affected macula. Progressive
neurodegeneration typically leads to death by age 2-5.
