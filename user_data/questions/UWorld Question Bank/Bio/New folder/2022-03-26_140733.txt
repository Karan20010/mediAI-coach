This patient's confusion, miosis and lacrimation, bradycardia, diaphoresis, and bronchospasm
(bilateral wheezes) indicate a state of global muscarinic cholinergic overstimulation. This
can be the result of a pharmacologic cholinomimetic (eg, carbachol, methacholine) or
cholinesterase inhibitor (blocks breakdown of endogenous acetylcholine).

Organophosphates are cholinesterase inhibitors that are widely used as pesticides in
agriculture. They are lipid soluble; rapidly absorbed via oral, cutaneous, and inhalational
routes of exposure; and readily penetrate the blood brain barrier. Organophosphates are
irreversible cholinesterase inhibitors; they elicit cholinergic stimulation that lasts until new
cholinesterase enzymes are synthesized. Organophosphate poisoning is treated with
muscarinic antagonists (eg, atropine) and pralidoxime (PAM), a drug that reactivates
acetylcholinesterase by binding organophosphates and decoupling them from the enzyme.

(Choices A, B, and C) Blockade of neuronal choline uptake and inhibition of choline
acetyltransferase would diminish acetylcholine synthesis. Blockade of acetylcholine uptake
into axoplasmic vesicles would reduce acetylcholine release from presynaptic neurons. A
decrease in acetylcholine synthesis or release would have effects opposite those observed in
this patient.
