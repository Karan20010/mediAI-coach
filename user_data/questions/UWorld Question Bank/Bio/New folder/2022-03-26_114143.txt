Educational objective:

Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by a deficiency of branched-chain alpha-keto
acid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that requires several coenzymes (thiamine; lipoate;
coenzymes A, FAD, NAD) to metabolize branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). Some patients
with milder forms of MSUD improve with high-dose thiamine treatment.
