A 54-year-old man with a history of chronic kidney disease due to hypertension develops
anemia. Evaluation reveals that the cause of anemia is erythropoietin deficiency.
Erythropoietin increases the numbers of erythroid precursor cells in the bone marrow and
induces heme production in erythrocyte precursors. In this patient, mature erythrocytes are
found that are unable to synthesize heme even though they contain detectable levels of
cytoplasmic enzymes involved in heme synthesis. Lack of which of the following cellular
organelles best explains this phenomenon?

() A. Endoplasmic reticulum
©) B. Golgi apparatus

©) C. Mitochondria

©, D. Nucleus

() E. Peroxisomes

(©) F. Proteasomes
