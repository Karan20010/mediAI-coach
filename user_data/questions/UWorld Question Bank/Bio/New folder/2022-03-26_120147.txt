polymerase

Type of RNA produced

Function

RNA polymerase |

18S, 5.8S & 28S ribosomal
RNA

Forms essential ribosomal components

RNA polymerase II

mRNA

Translated by ribosomes to form specific proteins

Small nuclear RNA

Involved in mRNA splicing & transcription regulation

MicroRNA

Causes gene silencing via translation arrest or MRNA
degradation

RNA polymerase III

Transfer RNA

Adaptor molecule linking codons with specific amino
acids

5S ribosomal RNA

Essential component of 60S ribosomal subunit

MRNA = messenger RNA.
