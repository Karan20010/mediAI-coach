The toxicity of cyanide is dependent upon its ability to bind ferric iron (Fe*-) with high affinity,
inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria. This electron transport chain enzyme is
essential for oxidative phosphorylation; inhibition results in severe lactic acidosis and death as
a result of cells switching to anaerobic metabolism.

Cyanide poisoning presents with reddish skin discoloration, tachypnea, headache, and
tachycardia, often accompanied by nausea/vomiting, confusion, and weakness. Symptoms
develop rapidly and can quickly progress to seizures and cardiovascular collapse. Laboratory
studies indicate severe lactic acidosis in conjunction with a narrowing of the venous-
arterial PO, gradient, resulting from the inability of tissue to extract arterial oxygen.

Administration of inhaled amyl nitrite oxidizes ferrous iron (Fez) present in hemoglobin to
ferric iron (Fe), generating methemoglobin. Methemoglobin is incapable of carrying oxygen
but has a high affinity for cyanide; it binds and sequesters cyanide in the blood, freeing it from
cytochrome oxidase and limiting its toxic effects. Hydroxycobalamin, a vitamin B,, precursor,
and sodium thiosulfate are also antidotes for cyanide poisoning. Their interactions with
cyanide generate relatively nontoxic metabolites that are easily excreted in the urine.
