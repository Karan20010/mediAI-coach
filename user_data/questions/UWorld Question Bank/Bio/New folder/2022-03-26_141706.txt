This patient with Crohn disease has epistaxis, bruising, and prolonged PT and PTT that are
corrected with an intravenous medication. This presentation is consistent with vitamin K
deficiency. Intestinal diseases associated with malabsorption (eg, inflammatory bowel
disease [IBD]) are a risk factor for vitamin K deficiency. Infectious complications of IBD may
also require frequent antibiotics, another possible contributing factor.

Vitamin K is a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme required for the
activation of coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X. These factors are produced
in the liver as inactive forms. The carboxylase enzyme converts glutamic acid residues to
gamma-carboxyglutamic acid in the hepatocyte endoplasmic reticulum (ie, posttranslational
carboxylation). Carboxylation allows the coagulation proteins to bind calcium ions in the
blood and subsequently adhere to the platelet's negatively charged phospholipid bilayer,
resulting in efficient coagulation.

Vitamin K deficiency leads to decreased coagulation factor activity, which predisposes to
bruising and mucosal bleeding. Patients have prolonged PT and, in severe cases, PTT.
Vitamin K replacement allows for carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors
and reverses the coagulopathy.
