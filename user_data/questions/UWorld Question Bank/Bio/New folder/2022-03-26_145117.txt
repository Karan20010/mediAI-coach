Proteins & their function in prokaryotic DNA replication

Helicase

Unwinding of double helix

Topoisomerase II (DNA
gyrase)

Removal of supercoils

Single-stranded DNA-
binding protein

Stabilization of unwound template strands

Primase (RNA polymerase)

Synthesis of RNA primer

DNA polymerase III

5' to 3' DNA synthesis & 3' to 5' exonuclease
("proofreading") activity

DNA polymerase |

Same as DNA polymerase III
Also removes RNA primer (5' to 3' exonuclease activity)
& replaces it with DNA

DNA ligase

Joining of Okazaki fragments (lagging strand)
