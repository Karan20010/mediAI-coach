This patient's synovial fluid analysis shows negatively birefringent crystals (ie, monosodium
urate crystals) under polarized light, which is diagnostic for gouty arthritis. Neutrophils are the
primary cells responsible for the intense inflammatory response seen in patients with gout.
Phagocytosis of urate crystals by neutrophils causes the release of various cytokines and
inflammatory mediators that lead to further neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, resulting in a
positive feedback loop that amplifies the inflammatory response.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line therapy for treating acute gouty
arthritis. They inhibit prostanoid biosynthesis (eg, prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
thromboxanes), exerting a broad anti-inflammatory effect that includes inhibition of
neutrophils. Patients with contraindications to NSAIDs (eg, peptic ulcer disease, renal
impairment) are often treated with colchicine, which impairs neutrophil migration and
phagocytosis by interfering with microtubule formation. Colchicine also decreases tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to monosodium urate crystals, resulting in decreased neutrophil
activation.
