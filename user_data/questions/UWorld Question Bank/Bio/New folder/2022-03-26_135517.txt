This patient has Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by the
development of dystonia, choreoathetosis, self-mutilation, and hyperuricemia within the first
few years of life. The condition is caused by deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), an enzyme that normally functions in the purine
salvage pathway to convert hypoxanthine back to inosine monophosphate and guanine back
into guanosine monophosphate. The absence of HGPRT results in increased degradation of
guanine and hypoxanthine bases into uric acid, which increases the demand for de novo
purine synthesis.
