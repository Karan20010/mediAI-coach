Erythrocytes use glycolysis as the major pathway to generate energy as they do not have
mitochondria and therefore cannot use the citric acid cycle. During normal glycolysis, ATP is
generated when 1,3-BPG is converted to 3-phosphoglycerate by the enzyme
phosphoglycerate kinase. However, erythrocytes can bypass this part of the pathway using
bisphosphoglycerate mutase, an enzyme that converts 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG in a step that
produces no ATP. 2,3-BPG is subsequently catabolized to 3-phosphoglycerate by
bisphosphoglycerate phosphatase in a step that also yields no ATP. By generating 2,3-BPG
rather than proceeding with regular glycolysis, erythrocytes sacrifice the net ATP gain achieved
in normal glycolysis.

The major function of erythrocytes is to carry hemoglobin-bound oxygen from the lungs to the
peripheral tissues, and 2,3-BPG is a very important regulator of oxygen-hemoglobin binding.
The conversion of 1,3-BPG to 2,3-BPG is increased in hypoxia and chronic anemia. 2,3-BPG
allosterically decreases hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. As a result, in the presence of lower
blood oxygen concentrations, higher 2,3-BPG levels within erythrocytes enable increased
oxygen delivery in the peripheral tissues.
