This patient's laboratory studies show the presence of ketones in the urine and maintenance of
fasting blood glucose values in the low-normal range despite prolonged fasting.

Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is an enzyme found in adipose tissue that catalyzes the
mobilization of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids (FFAs) and glycerol. HSL is activated
in response to stress hormones (eg, catecholamines, glucagon, ACTH), whereas it is inhibited
by the release of insulin. The stress hormones stimulate Gs protein-coupled receptors on
adipocytes, leading to increased cAMP production and activation of protein kinase A (PKA).
Finally, PKA phosphorylates and activates HSL, stimulating lipolysis.

FFAs and glycerol released into the circulation can be taken up by the liver, where the glycerol
is used primarily as a carbon source for gluconeogenesis. The liver oxidizes the FFAs to
acetyl-coA, which can then be further metabolized to ketone bodies (eg, acetoacetate, beta-
hydroxybutyrate) or shunted into the TCA cycle to generate energy for gluconeogenesis.
During starvation, most tissues utilize a combination of FFAs and ketones for their energy
needs. Important exceptions include the brain (FFAs do not cross the blood-brain barrier, so
only ketone bodies/glucose can be used) and erythrocytes (can use only glucose due to lack
of mitochondria).
