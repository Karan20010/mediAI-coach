Educational objective:

Following endothelial damage, von Willebrand factor (vWF) binds glycoprotein Ib receptors on
platelets to mediate platelet adherence. The ristocetin cofactor assay measures platelet
agglutination via binding of glycoprotein Ib receptors to vWF; it will be abnormal in vWF
deficiency but will correct with the addition of normal (vWF-containing) plasma.
