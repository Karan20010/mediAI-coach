Globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are compactly folded due to nonpolar hydrophobic
residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface. In sickle cell disease, the
usual acidic (negatively charged) glutamic acid (glu) residue at the sixth position on the beta
globin chain is replaced by a nonpolar (neutral charge) valine (val) residue, forming
hemoglobin S (HbS). This single glu â€” val substitution leads to the formation of a
hydrophobic pocket on the beta globin surface that interacts with a complementary nonpolar
residue on another hemoglobin molecule. The hydrophobic interaction causes
polymerization of HbS molecules and subsequent erythrocyte sickling, leading to
membrane damage and permanent distortion of red blood cells. Red cell sickling is promoted
by low oxygen levels, increased acidity, and dehydration.

In patients with hemoglobin C (HbC), glu is replaced by a basic polar (positively charged)
lysine (lys) residue. Because lys is charged (although it has opposite polarity to glu), there is
no hydrophobic interaction between hemoglobin molecules and no polymerization/sickling.
However, the positive charge of lys causes HbC to have decreased mobility on
electrophoresis.
