Iron bound to heme is normally in the reduced ferrous (Fez) state. Nitrites cause poisoning
by inducing the conversion of this heme iron to the oxidized ferric (Fes) state, leading to the
formation of methemoglobin. With iron in the oxidized ferric state, methemoglobin is unable
to bind oxygen. In addition, the affinity of any residual ferrous iron in the hemoglobin tetramer
is increased, causing a leftward shift of the oxygen-dissociation curve. However, the partial
pressure of oxygen in blood, which represents the amount of oxygen dissolved in the
plasma, is unchanged.

Methemoglobinemia causes dusky discoloration of the skin (similar to cyanosis), and because
methemoglobin is unable to carry oxygen, a state of functional anemia is induced.
