¢ First, bilirubin production is increased due to increased breakdown of fetal RBCs, which
are high in number (hematocrit up to 60%) and have a shorter life span (90 days as

compared to 120 days in adults).

¢ Second, bilirubin conjugation is decreased due to physiologically lower levels of UDP
glucuronosyltransferase in the immature neonatal liver.

e Finally, relative gut sterility in newborns results in decreased reduction of bilirubin to
urobilinogen; instead, intestinal B-glucuronidase (which is synthesized both endogenously
and by gut bacteria) deconjugates the bilirubin which allows it to be reabsorbed, therefore

increasing enterohepatic circulation.

Educational objective:

Pathophysiology of benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia involves increased bilirubin production
and decreased bilirubin conjugation as well as increased enterohepatic circulation. Indirect
hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice typically peak in the first few days of life and usually resolve

without intervention.
