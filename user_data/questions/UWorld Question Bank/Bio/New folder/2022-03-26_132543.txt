(Choice B) Glucuronyl transferase (uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase) is
necessary for hepatic bilirubin conjugation. Gilbert syndrome, a condition marked by jaundice
(elevated unconjugated bilirubin levels) during times of stress, results from mutations in the
gene encoding glucuronyl transferase.

(Choice C) Defects in porphobilinogen deaminase result in acute intermittent porphyria (AIP),
a disorder characterized by acute attacks of abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and
red or brown urine. The chronicity of symptoms, lack of abdominal pain, and anemia make
AIP unlikely in this patient.

(Choice D) Pyruvate kinase deficiency is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern
and leads to hemolytic anemia. Pyruvate kinase deficiency can present with pallor, scleral
icterus, and splenomegaly, but it does not present with behavioral regression or language
difficulties.

(Choice E) Defects in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase cause porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT),
the most common form of porphyria. Patients with PCT exhibit chronic photosensitivity with
blistering in areas of sun exposure and elevated levels of uroporphyrinogen in the urine.
