This patient has a resolving hematoma after a traumatic injury. Following the injury,
hemoglobin-containing erythrocytes escape into the periorbital tissues, giving the bruise its
initial purple or bluish color. Erythrocyte destruction causes the release of iron-containing
heme molecules. Heme oxygenase (contained in macrophages, among other cells) degrades
heme into biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and ferrous iron while consuming oxygen and
electrons provided by NADH and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase. Biliverdin is green in
color and is further reduced (by the enzyme biliverdin reductase) to the yellow pigment
bilirubin, which is then transported to the liver bound to albumin.
