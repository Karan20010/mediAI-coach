(Choice A) Glycogen phosphorylase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycogenolysis, a process
that frees glucose-1-phosphate from stored glycogen chains. Glycogenolysis increases blood
glucose levels during the first several hours of fasting but has no effect on fatty acid oxidation.

(Choice C) Lipoprotein lipase is an enzyme found on endothelial cells that functions to
degrade triglycerides found in chylomicrons and VLDL. Although it is functionally similar to
HSL, it works in the bloodstream to form FFAs that are then transported into adipocytes
storage or used by tissues (eg, heart/skeletal muscle) for energy production.

(Choice D) Mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase plays a role in the production of ketones.
Although it could be responsible for the presence of urinary ketone bodies in this patient, it
would not account for the maintenance of blood glucose levels.

(Choice E) Phosphofructokinase-1 catalyzes the major rate-limiting step in glycolysis by
converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. It is not involved in
gluconeogenesis or ketone production.

Educational objective:

Hormone-sensitive lipase is found in adipose tissue, where it functions to drive the breakdown
of stored triglycerides into free fatty acids and glycerol. During times of starvation, this enzyme
provides substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis and ketone body formation.
