The alteration of cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis is
a crucial part of oncogenesis, and is thought to benefit cancer cells due to the following:

Â¢ Shunting glucose away from oxidative phosphorylation increases the concentration of
glucose metabolic products (eg, ribulose 5-P, serine, glycine, glycerol) for the synthesis of
nucleic acids, amino acids, and lipids.

e Lactic acid excretion promotes production of vascular endothelial growth factor by stromal
cells, which improves blood flow to the tumor. It also creates an acidic tumor
microenvironment, which impairs antitumor cytotoxic T cells.

Because anaerobic glycolysis generates only 2 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose,
tumor cells uptake much more glucose than normal cells. Therefore, areas of tumor activity
can usually be visualized by positron emission scanning with radiolabeled glucose.
