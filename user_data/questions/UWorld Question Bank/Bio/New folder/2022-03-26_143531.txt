(Choices B through E) Vitamin B,is not a cofactor for these enzymes, and anemia would not
improve with vitamin B, supplementation. However, other aberrations in the heme synthesis
pathway cause clinically recognized disease. For example, porphyria cutanea tarda is an
acquired condition in which the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (Choice D) is
markedly inhibited, causing porphyrin accumulation in skin and photosensitivity. In addition,
acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disease in which porphobilinogen
deaminase (Choice C) deficiency leads to episodes of abdominal pain and peripheral
neuropathy.

Educational objective:
Vitamin B, (pyridoxine) is a required cofactor for the enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase,

which catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step in porphyrin synthesis. Defects in this enzyme
cause X-linked sideroblastic anemia.
