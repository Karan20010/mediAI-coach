(Choice A) Acyclovir and related drugs (eg, famciclovir and valacyclovir) are inhibitors of viral
DNA polymerase.

(Choice C) Ricin (from the castor oil plant Ricinus communis) is a potent toxin that inhibits
protein synthesis by cleaving the rRNA component of the eukaryotic 60S subunit.

(Choice D) The only function of RNA polymerase | is to transcribe the majority of the
eukaryotic ribosomal RNA components. RNA polymerase | is insensitive to amatoxins.
(Choice E) Eukaryotic RNA polymerase III transcribes transfer RNA, 5S ribosomal RNA, and
other small RNA molecules. It is only weakly affected by amatoxins.

Educational objective:

Amatoxins are found in a variety of poisonous mushrooms (eg, Amanita phalloides, known as
death cap) and are potent inhibitors of RNA polymerase II (halting mRNA synthesis).
