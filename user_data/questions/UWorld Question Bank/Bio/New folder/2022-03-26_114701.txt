Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate helps control the balance between gluconeogenesis and
glycolysis through inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and fructose 1,6-
bisphosphatase. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates PFK-1, the main regulatory enzyme
involved in glycolysis, which converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The
opposite reaction (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) occurs in
gluconeogenesis and is catalyzed by the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (inhibited by
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate).

The interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is achieved by a
bifunctional enzyme complex composed of PFK-2 (increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels)
and fructose 2,6-bisphosphosphatase (decreases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels). Insulin
causes activation of PFK-2, leading to increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels and
augmented glycolysis. High concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate also inhibit
gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased conversion of alanine and other gluconeogenic
substrates to glucose.
