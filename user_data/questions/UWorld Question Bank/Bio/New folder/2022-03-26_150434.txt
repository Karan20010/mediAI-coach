(Choice B) $-glucuronidase is released by damaged hepatocytes and bacteria in infected
bile. It deconjugates bilirubin, and the resulting free bilirubin precipitates with calcium in the
bile to form pigmented gallstones. Decreased activity of this enzyme would reduce the
formation of pigmented stones but would not affect the formation of cholesterol gallstones.

(Choices D and E) The first step in cholesterol synthesis is the condensation of 2 molecules
of acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA acetyl transferase (thiolase) to form acetoacetyl-CoA.
Condensation with a third molecule of acetyl-CoA yields B-hydroxy-B-methylglutaryl-CoA
(HMG-CoA). HMG-CoA reductase then catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate,
the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. Decreased activity of these enzymes would
reduce cholesterol synthesis and the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile, discouraging
cholesterol stone formation.

Educational objective:

Fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) inhibit cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase, which
catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids. The reduced bile acid production
results in decreased cholesterol solubility in bile and favors the formation of cholesterol
gallstones.
