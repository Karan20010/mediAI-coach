Educational objective:

2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) normally forms ionic bonds with the beta subunits of
deoxygenated hemoglobin A, facilitating oxygen release in the peripheral tissues. Mutations
that result in loss of the 2,3-BPG binding pocket's positive charge cause hemoglobin A to
resemble fetal hemoglobin, which binds oxygen with a higher affinity due to its inability to
interact with 2,3-BPG.
