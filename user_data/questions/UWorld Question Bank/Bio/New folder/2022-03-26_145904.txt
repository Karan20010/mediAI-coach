In an animal experiment, murine proerythroblasts are cultured in 2 different growth media; the
first medium is folate deficient, whereas the second (control) is supplemented with additional
folic acid. Both media contain high concentrations of erythropoietin. Over 48 hours, cells in

the control media proliferate and differentiate into reticulocytes, whereas in the folate-deficient
media, cell proliferation is minimal, with the majority of cells undergoing apoptosis. In another
experiment, a substance is added to the folate-deficient media; this substance prevents
apoptosis and permits proliferation of some of the proerythroblasts. Which of the following is

the most likely substance added to the growth medium?

© A. Cobalamin

©) B. Cytosine

©, C. Glutamine

|) D. Homocysteine
©) E. Thymidine
