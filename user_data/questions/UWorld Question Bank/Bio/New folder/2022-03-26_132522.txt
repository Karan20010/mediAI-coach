This child's language regression and anemia are most likely due to lead poisoning. Lead
toxicity is most prevalent among impoverished children residing in deteriorating urban
housing built before 1978. Young children are particularly susceptible to lead poisoning via
inhalation and ingestion of lead-based paint dust or chips due to normal crawling and mouthing
behaviors. The incomplete blood-brain-barrier in children is vulnerable to the neurotoxic
effects of lead, which include long-standing behavioral problems and developmental delay or
regression.

Anemia in lead poisoning results from inhibition of ferrochelatase and 5-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA) dehydratase in the heme biosynthesis pathway. Because protoporphyrin IX cannot
combine with iron (Fez) to form heme due to ferrochelatase inhibition, it instead incorporates a
zinc ion, leading to elevated zinc protoporphyrin levels. In addition, ALA levels are
increased. Lead poisoning also commonly coexists with iron deficiency anemia, and severe
lead poisoning can also induce hemolytic anemia.
