Mismatch repair begins with MutS homolog detecting a mismatch on the newly created
daughter strand, which is distinguished from the parent strand by occasional nicks in the

phosphodiester bonds. MutL homolog is then recruited, and the resulting complex slides along

the DNA molecule until 1 of the daughter strand nicks is encountered. At this point,
exonuclease 1 is loaded onto and activated by the repair complex. The daughter strand is
then degraded backward past the initial mismatch point, leaving a variable gap of single-
stranded DNA that is stabilized by ssDNA-binding protein. The complex then dissociates while
DNA polymerase delta loads at the 3' end of the discontinuity and begins synthesizing a new
daughter strand segment. Finally, DNA ligase | seals the remaining nick to complete the repair
process.

(Choice B) Exposure to ultraviolet light can cause pyrimidine (usually thymine) dimers to form
due to covalent joining of adjacent pyrimidines. Pyrimidine dimers interfere with DNA
replication and are removed by nucleotide excision repair.

(Choices C and D) Several types of insults can alter the DNA bases. For example, nitrous
acid can deaminate C, A, and G. There are also spontaneous changes, such as deamination
of C to U and the constant low-level loss of purines via thermal disruption. Glycosylases are

enzymes that detect and remove abnormal bases from DNA, creating an empty sugar-
