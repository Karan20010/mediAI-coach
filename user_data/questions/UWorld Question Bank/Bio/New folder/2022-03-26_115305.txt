Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is characterized by
xanthomas and premature coronary and peripheral vascular disease. It is an autosomal
recessive disorder that is clinically more severe in patients with other conditions affecting
lipoprotein metabolism (eg, diabetes, hypothyroidism).

The primary defects in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia are in ApoE3 and ApoE4,
apolipoproteins found on the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons and VLDLs) that are
responsible for binding hepatic apolipoprotein receptors. Without ApoE3 and ApoE4, the liver
cannot efficiently remove chylomicrons and VLDL remnants from the circulation, causing their
accumulation in the blood and resultant elevations in cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
