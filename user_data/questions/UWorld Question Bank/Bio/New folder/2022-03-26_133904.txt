A couple comes to the clinic for preconception counseling. They are offered genetic screening
because they are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Test results show that both are carriers for a
lysosomal enzyme deficiency disorder that results in decreased metabolic degradation of a
phospholipid substrate to ceramide, which leads to a buildup of the phospholipid. They are
counseled about the chance that their offspring will be affected by this disorder. The couple
wants to know the clinical features of an affected child. Which of the following findings would
be most consistent with this condition?

A. Abnormally shaped bones and corneal clouding (10%)

B. Coarse facial features and cardiac dysfunction (12%)

C. Neuropathic pain and angiokeratomas (31%)
YD. Retinal opacification and splenomegaly (42%)

E. Small stature and infertility (2%)
