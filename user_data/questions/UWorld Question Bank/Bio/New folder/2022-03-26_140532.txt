(Choices A and C) The molecule 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) binds the 2 B globin
chains ionically and stabilizes the taut (T) deoxyhemoglobin. This binding decreases
hemoglobin's oxygen affinity, facilitating oxygen release at the tissue level. With 2,3-BPG
depletion, hemoglobin affinity for oxygen increases (left shift on oxygen-hemoglobin
dissociation curve), and this results in oxygen uptake by hemoglobin; therefore, erythrocyte
sickling will decrease. Similarly, increased acidity or low pH is associated with sickling, so
decreased acidity with elevated capillary pH values >7.4 would not promote sickling.

(Choice B) The globin chains in the hemoglobin tetramer are folded compactly, with nonpolar
hydrophobic residues in the interior and charged polar residues on the surface. A valine for
glutamic acid substitution does not result in a significant change in B globin folding. It is the
mature hemoglobin tetramer that undergoes polymerization, not individual globin chains during
folding.

(Choice D) HbS does not polymerize when fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is present, so patients with

sickle cell anemia often do not have symptoms until the HbF fraction decreases a few months
after delivery. Some patients with HbS may have fewer clinical manifestations because they
produce larger amounts of HbF as adults.
