(Choice A) During trauma resuscitation, most patients are given isotonic fluids (eg, normal
saline, Ringer lactate), which are unlikely to cause hyperglycemia. Even if mild fluid-induced
hyperglycemia occurs, blood glucose levels typically normalize quickly after fluid boluses.

(Choice B) Norepinephrine stimulates peripheral lipolysis, releasing glycerol, which can be
taken up by the liver for use in gluconeogenesis. Therefore, stress increases, not decreases,
the hepatic glycerol supply.

(Choice C) Severe illness is often associated with increased anaerobic glycolysis due to
systemic or local tissue hypoxia (blood loss in this patient). Increased conversion of glucose to
lactate in ischemic tissues raises plasma lactate levels. Glucose levels are often concurrently
elevated due to stress hyperglycemia, but anaerobic glycolysis itself depletes glucose.

(Choice E) The renal cortex can convert lactate to glucose via gluconeogenesis. However, it

makes a significantly smaller contribution to circulating glucose levels than hepatic
gluconeogenesis.
