A researcher is studying the role of glucose metabolites in normal cellular function. A specific
human cell type is incubated in glucose-rich media. Intracellular levels of glucose metabolizing
enzymes, intermediate products, and generated ATP are measured. In these cells, glycolysis
of a single glucose molecule always yields pyruvate but sometimes generates no net ATP.
Which of the following cells is most likely being studied in this experiment?

© A. Adipocytes
© B. Erythrocytes
(©) C. Hepatocytes
©) D. Neurons

©) E. Skeletal muscle cells
