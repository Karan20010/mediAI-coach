Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH.) is a cofactor in the synthesis of serotonin (a major neurotransmitter),
tyrosine (a precursor of DOPA), and DOPA (the antecedent of the neurotransmitters dopamine,
norepinephrine and epinephrine). Dihydropteridine reductase enzymatically reduces

dihydrobiopterin (BH.) to tetrahydrobiopterin (BH,). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or SHT) is

formed through hydroxylation and decarboxylation of the amino acid tryptophan.

Most cases of phenylketonuria are due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency. Less
commonly, the etiology is due to BH, deficiency secondary to dihydropteridine reductase
deficiency. The consequences of defective phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolism are
phenylalanine accumulation (Choice D) and low levels of serotonin and other
neurotransmitters, respectively.

The combination of high phenylalanine levels, which may disrupt neuronal and glial
development, and low serotonin and other neurotransmitters results in progressive neurologic
deterioration in untreated patients. Manifestations include developmental delay, hypotonia,
dystonia, and seizures. Treatment includes both a low phenylalanine diet and BH,

supplementation.
