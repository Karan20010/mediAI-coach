(Choice A) Thiamine (vitamin B,) is a cofactor in several decarboxylation reactions that are

catalyzed by dehydrogenase enzymes (eg, pyruvate to acetyl coenzyme A) in the citric acid

cycle. Deficiency can cause peripheral neuropathy (dry beriberi), heart failure (wet beriberi),
and central nervous system dysfunction (Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome).

(Choice C) Vitamin B, (pyridoxine) is a cofactor in several reactions that involve amino acids
(eg, transamination, decarboxylation, deamination). In contrast to this case, pyridoxine
deficiency manifests with cheilosis, glossitis, and peripheral neuropathy.

(Choices D and E) Folate deficiency causes decreased purine and thymidine synthesis,
which manifests with megaloblastic anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor, irritability). Vitamin B,. is a
cofactor for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and for synthesis of succinyl
coenzyme A from methylmalonyl coenzyme A; deficiency also presents with megaloblastic
anemia in addition to neurologic dysfunction.

Educational objective:

Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues during
collagen synthesis. Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy), primarily seen in patients with malnutrition
(eg, alcohol use disorder), leads to capillary bleeding (eg, epistaxis), poor wound healing,

follicular hyperkeratosis, and periodontal disease.
