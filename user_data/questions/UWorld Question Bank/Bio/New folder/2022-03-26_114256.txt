Gout is a disease caused by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Elevated uric

acid levels are a known risk factor for gout and increased purine metabolism is one possible

cause of hyperuricemia. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase is the enzyme

responsible for the production of the activated ribose necessary for de novo synthesis of

purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. The mutation described in the question stem will cause

increased production of purines due to feed-forward activation of the purine synthesis

pathway. As a result, more purine molecules will undergo degradation, resulting in

hyperuricemia and an increased risk of gout.

(Choice A) The aorta can develop aneurysms in patients with Marfan syndrome, which results
from defects in fibrillin-1.

(Choices B and D) The heart and liver can be affected by glycogen storage diseases
resulting from a variety of enzyme deficiencies such as glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (von
Gierke disease) and acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease).

(Choice E) The pancreas is affected in patients with cystic fibrosis, which results from a
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Common
sequelae include pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and destruction of islet cells.
