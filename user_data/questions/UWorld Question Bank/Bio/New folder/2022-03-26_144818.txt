(Choice C) Hereditary spherocytosis results from a variety of molecular defects involving
erythrocyte structural proteins responsible for linking the plasma membrane to the
cytoskeleton (eg, spectrin, ankyrin). The resulting membrane instability leads to the formation
of spherocytes — small, rounded erythrocytes with increased susceptibility to lyse in hypotonic
solutions.

(Choice D) Megaloblastic erythrocyte changes (t MCV) are characteristically seen in vitamin
B,. and folic acid deficiency due to impaired DNA synthesis.

(Choice E) Individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency develop rapid
hemolysis during periods of increased oxidant stress, such as when taking antimalarials or
sulfonamides or after ingestion of fava beans.

Educational objective:

P., refers to the partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated.
Hemoglobins with high oxygen affinity have a decreased P., that is represented by a leftward
shift of the oxygen dissociation curve. The reduced ability to release oxygen within the
peripheral tissues leads to renal hypoxia, increased erythropoietin synthesis, and
compensatory erythrocytosis.
