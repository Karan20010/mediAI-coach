In the well-fed state, the abundance of ATP in hepatocytes inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase,
leading to high levels of citrate in the mitochondria. Citrate is transferred to the cytosol via the
citrate shuttle and cleaved by ATP citrate lyase to form acetyl-CoA. High citrate levels (in
addition to elevated insulin caused by high carbohydrate intake) causes upregulation of
Acetyl-CoA carboxylase. This cytosolic enzyme catalyzes the conversion of acetyl-CoA to
malonyl-CoA in the rate-limiting step of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Fatty acid synthase
then catalyzes the condensation of malonyl-CoA with acetyl-CoA to create a 4-carbon
molecule that will undergo subsequent condensation reactions to form a 16-carbon fatty acid.

Beta-oxidation of fatty acids takes place primarily within the mitochondrial matrix.
Mitochondrial membranes are impermeable to fatty acids due to their negative charge, so a
specialized membrane carrier (carnitine) must be used to shuttle them into the matrix.
Malonyl-CoA inhibits carnitine acyltransferase, preventing the transfer of acyl groups into
the mitochondria. This inhibitory action functions to prevent the breakdown of newly
synthesized fatty acids.

(Choice A) Ketone bodies (eg, acetoacetate) are a major source of fuel for muscle, brain, and
cardiac tissue that are produced during times of starvation or fasting when oxaloacetate is in
short supply and acetyl-CoA is in excess.
