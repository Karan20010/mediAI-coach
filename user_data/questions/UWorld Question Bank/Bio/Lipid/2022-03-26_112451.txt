This patient developed hypoketotic hypoglycemia after fasting, which is consistent with a
defect in fatty acid beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids yields
FADH, and NADH for ATP production and generates acetyl-CoA for use in the citric acid cycle
or ketone body production. Ketone bodies are an important energy source during periods of
fasting; adults generally require more than 1-2 days of fasting before ketone use becomes
substantial, whereas children have limited glucose reserves and begin using ketone bodies
after as little as 8-10 hours.

Impaired beta-oxidation can be caused by a variety of enzymatic defects, the most common of
which is medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Affected individuals may
remain asymptomatic for long periods until they experience a significant fast, during which
they are unable to oxidize fatty acids to maintain glucose and ketone body production. Classic
manifestations include hypoketotic hypoglycemia (eg, undetectable acetoacetate level), mild
hepatomegaly, and liver dysfunction. Because the resulting metabolic crisis can have severe
consequences (eg, seizures, sudden infant death), fatty acid oxidation disorders are part of
standard newborn screening.
