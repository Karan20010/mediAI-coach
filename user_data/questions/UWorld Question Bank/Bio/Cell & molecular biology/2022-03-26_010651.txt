(Choices B, C, and F) Catecholamines (eg, epinephrine, norepinephrine) and glucagon
attenuate hypoglycemia. However, they exert their metabolic effects via extracellular,
transmembrane, G protein—coupled receptors that activate adenyl cyclase and increase cyclic
AMP production.

(Choice D) Growth hormone acts via an extracellular, transmembrane receptor that activates
a JAK-STAT pathway. Growth hormone antagonizes insulin action, increases
gluconeogenesis, and promotes lipolysis (provides gluconeogenic substrates).

(Choice E) In addition to the production of counterregulatory hormones, the inhibition of
insulin release from pancreatic beta cells plays a primary role in preventing hypoglycemia
during fasting. However, insulin acts on a extracellular transmembrane receptor with intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity.

Educational objective:

In a fasting state, glucagon and epinephrine bind to transmembrane receptors and prevent
hypoglycemia by increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Prolonged fasting
increases the secretion of cortisol, a steroid hormone that binds to an intracellular receptor and
acts to increase transcription of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and
proteolysis.
