In contrast, non-lipid-soluble hormones interact with transmembrane receptors found on the
cell membrane. These receptors use a signal transduction cascade involving second
messengers with subsequent activation of non-receptor-associated transcription factors; they
do not contain DNA-binding domains. Examples include the G-protein-coupled receptors that
bind ACTH, ADH, epinephrine, and glucagon (Choices A, B, C, and D) as well as receptors
with intrinsic and associated tyrosine kinase activity (eg, insulin and growth hormone
receptors, respectively) (Choices E and F).

Educational objective:

Zinc-finger motifs are composed of chains of amino acids bound together around a zinc atom
via linkages with cysteine and histidine residues. They recognize specific DNA sequences and
are used by many transcription factors to bind DNA and alter activity of target genes.
Intracellular receptors that bind steroids, thyroid hormone, and fat-soluble vitamins act directly
as transcription factors and contain zinc-finger binding domains.
