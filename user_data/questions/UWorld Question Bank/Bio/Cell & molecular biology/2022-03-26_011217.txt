(Choice B) Binding of a ligand to the extracellular domain of a transmembrane receptor can
result in activation of the cAMP or phosphatidylinositol second messenger system, activation
of receptor tyrosine kinases, opening of ion channels, and activation of the calcium-calmodulin
system. The extracellular domain of these receptors is typically composed of hydrophilic

amino acids.

(Choice C) Activation of G protein-coupled receptors utilizing the cAMP second messenger
system results in increased synthesis of intracellular CAMP and subsequent activation of
protein kinase A. Protein kinase A then phosphorylates cytosolic proteins that translocate into
the nucleus and bind to DNA promoter regions to modulate transcription.

(Choice D) Intracellular iron-containing proteins (hemeproteins) include hemoglobin,
myoglobin, and cytochrome oxidase. Heme is a complex of protoporphyrin IX and iron.
Hemoglobin A, the most common hemoglobin in adults, consists of 2 alpha and 2 beta globin
chains held together by noncovalent interactions. Each subunit contains stretches of alpha
helices that form a heme-binding pocket lined by nonpolar amino acids.

(Choice E) Insulin and IGF-1 bind to receptors that possess tyrosine kinase on their

intracellular domain (receptor tyrosine kinases). These receptors dimerize upon ligand binding
to the extracellular domain, which subsequently activates tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase
