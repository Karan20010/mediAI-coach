(Choice A) Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the components of
the extracellular matrix (eg, collagen, laminin, fibronectin). Metalloproteinases are essential for
proper tissue remodeling during wound healing.
(Choice B) Acid hydrolases do not participate in apoptosis.
(Choice D) Phospholipase A, does not participate in apoptosis.

(Choice E) Protein kinase Ais a component of the cAMP-associated signaling system. The
binding of a ligand to a G-protein-linked receptor results in adenylyl cyclase activation and the
release of cAMP. Elevated levels of cAMP activate protein kinase A.

Educational Objective:
Apoptosis can occur through either the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway or the
extrinsic (receptor-initiated) pathway. Both pathways converge in the activation of caspases.

Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that cleave cellular proteins.
