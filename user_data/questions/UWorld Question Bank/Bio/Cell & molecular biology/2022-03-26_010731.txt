kinetics.
(Choices A, B, C, D) These other factors are important for determining the rate of diffusion
(ie, slope of the line), but would not explain the flattening of the curve in line 1 (which is best
accounted for by saturation of a protein carrier). In general, the rate of diffusion increases

with:

¢ Higher concentration gradients across the membrane
e Lower molecular weight

¢ Larger diffusion surface area

¢ Thinner membrane thickness.

For molecules that move through the membrane via simple diffusion, the degree of lipophilicity
is also important; molecules with a high oil-water partition coefficient are more easily able to
cross the membrane and will diffuse faster.

Educational objective:

Carrier-mediated transport includes facilitated diffusion and active transport. Movement of
substrate across the cell membrane by these mechanisms depends on the presence of carrier
proteins that can become saturated at high substrate concentrations.
