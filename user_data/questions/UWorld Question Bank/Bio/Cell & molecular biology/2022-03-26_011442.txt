Calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) are transmembrane G, protein-coupled
(metabotropic) receptors that regulate the secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in response
to changes in circulating calcium levels. Binding of calcium to CaSRs leads to the inhibition of
PTH release, whereas low calcium levels allow increased PTH release.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a benign autosomal dominant disorder
caused by defective CaSRs in the parathyroid gland and kidneys. In FHH, higher serum
calcium levels are required to suppress the secretion of PTH. This raises the set point of
calcium-induced regulation of PTH secretion. Patients with FHH have mild asymptomatic
hypercalcemia, reduced urinary excretion of calcium, and high normal or mildly elevated PTH.
