Educational objective:

Calcium-sensing receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that regulate the secretion of
parathyroid hormone in response to changes in circulating calcium levels. Familial
hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a benign autosomal dominant disorder caused by defective
calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid gland and kidneys.
