Educational Objective:

The resting membrane potential is the difference in the electrical charges across the cell
membrane under steady-state conditions. The ions that are most permeable to the cell
membrane make the largest contribution to the resting membrane potential. In general, a high
potassium efflux and some sodium influx are responsible for the value of the resting potential,

which is typically about -70 mV.
