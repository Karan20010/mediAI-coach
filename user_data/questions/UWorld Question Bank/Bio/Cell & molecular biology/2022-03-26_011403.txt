Educational objective:

Ubiquitin is a protein that undergoes ATP-dependent attachment to other proteins, labeling
them for degradation. These modified proteins enter the proteasome and are degraded into
small peptides. Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the
development of neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases.
