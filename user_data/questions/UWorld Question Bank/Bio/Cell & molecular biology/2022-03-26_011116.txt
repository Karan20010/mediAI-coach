Nuclear chromosomes contain most of the DNA found in human cells. However, mitochondria
also contain their own DNA called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This DNA exists as a small
circular chromosome with a slightly different genetic code than that of nuclear DNA,
consistent with the endosymbiotic theory that mitochondria originated as prokaryotic cells that
were later engulfed by ancient eukaryotes.

Over time, most of the genes coding for mitochondrial proteins have migrated to nuclear DNA.
However, mtDNA still codes for about 14 proteins (some involved in oxidative metabolic
pathways) and the ribosomal and transfer RNA needed for mitochondrial protein synthesis.
Each mitochondrion contains 1-10 copies of maternally derived mtDNA. As a result,
diseases arising from mutations in mtDNA are transmitted from the mother to all of her
offspring.

Mitochondria can be identified on electron microscopy by their characteristic double
membrane and wavy cristae.
