The image above illustrates the difference between the rate of transport of solute across the
cell membrane in simple diffusion (line 2) and carrier-mediated transport (line 1).

There are two types of diffusion:

¢ Simple diffusion — molecules move through a membrane without the help of carrier
proteins.
¢ Facilitated diffusion — requires carrier proteins.

Carrier proteins are typically transmembrane proteins that possess binding sites for the
substrate they transport. Binding is followed by movement of the substrate across the cell
membrane to the intracellular space, where it is released into the cytoplasm. Because there is
a finite number of carrier proteins in the cell membrane, transporter saturation occurs with
facilitated diffusion, and can be seen as a flattening of the curve (maximum diffusion speed),
even as solute concentration continues to increase. This maximum rate of transport is referred
to as the transport maximum (T,,) and is similar in principle to the V,,.. in standard enzyme
kinetics.
