1.
Prokaryotes and eukaryotes use divergent cellular machinery for protein synthesis and require

different signaling sequences for efficient transcription and translation. Expression cloning is a
type of DNA cloning where the signals necessary for optimal protein expression are included in
the DNA vector. In this example, eukaryotic complementary DNA (containing the coding
sequence for the protein of interest) is modified with prokaryotic promoter sequences (eg,
the Pribnow box, -35 sequence) and a ribosomal binding site (Shine-Dalgarno sequence).
The vector is then incorporated into a suitable bacterial host (eg, Escherichia coli) and
subsequently transcribed and translated into protein.

The protein produced in the bioreactor contains a DNA-binding domain. DNA-binding
proteins are a diverse group that include transcription factors (Myc, CREB), steroid
receptors (cortisol, aldosterone, progesterone), thyroid hormone receptor, fat-soluble
vitamin receptors (vitamin D, retinoic acid), and DNA transcription and replication proteins.
2.
Of the choices listed, only the progesterone receptor can bind to DNA. The receptors for
most steroid hormones, including progesterone, are located in the cytoplasm and translocate
to the nucleus upon ligand binding. In contrast, receptors for thyroid hormone and vitamins A
and D are located within the nucleus at all times. Following activation by ligand binding, both
receptor types attach to DNA at hormone response elements located in the promoter region of
target genes to alter gene transcription.

Educational objective:
DNA-binding proteins include transcription factors (Myc, CREB), steroid receptors (cortisol,
aldosterone, progesterone), thyroid hormone receptor, fat-soluble vitamin receptors (vitamin D,
retinoic acid), and DNA transcription and replication proteins.
