Biologists investigating the morphologic changes associated with reversible cellular injury
perform a procedure on anesthetized mice to assess the effects of transient hepatic ischemia.
During the experiment, they clamp the hepatic artery and obtain liver biopsy samples at
varying intervals. The samples are then examined by electron microscopy. Cells that are
exposed to longer ischemic periods are found to have reduced numbers of ribosomes attached
to the endoplasmic reticulum. This structural change is most likely to impair which of the
following cellular functions?

A. ATP production (3%)
B. Drug detoxification (3%)

Y _ C. Synthesis of cell membrane proteins (64%)
D. Synthesis of cytosolic proteins (24%)

E. Synthesis of steroid hormones (4%)
