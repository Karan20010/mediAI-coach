pancreatic malignancies.

(Choices A and C) ATP serves as a phosphate source for kinase-dependent phosphorylation
reactions involved in numerous intracellular signaling pathways. It is also used as a substrate
to produce cyclic AMP (cAMP) in the cAMP second messenger system.

(Choice B) Caz is important for cell signaling as its intracellular presence alters the function of
many proteins and enzymes. Caz is required for many basic physiologic activities including

apoptosis, muscular contraction, and neuronal transmission.

(Choice E) IP; is the water-soluble component of the IP./DAG second messenger system. IP;
acts on the endoplasmic reticulum to cause intracellular Caz release while DAG remains in the
cell membrane and activates membrane-bound protein kinases.

Educational objective:

Regulation of the Ras-MAPK signal transduction pathway requires a balance between active
(GTP-bound) and inactive (GDP-bound) Ras proteins. RAS gene mutations, which result in
constitutively activated Ras proteins, are implicated in the development of malignant tumors.
