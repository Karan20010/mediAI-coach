Of the choices listed, only the progesterone receptor can bind to DNA. The receptors for
most steroid hormones, including progesterone, are located in the cytoplasm and translocate
to the nucleus upon ligand binding. In contrast, receptors for thyroid hormone and vitamins A
and D are located within the nucleus at all times. Following activation by ligand binding, both
receptor types attach to DNA at hormone response elements located in the promoter region of
target genes to alter gene transcription.
