Educational objective:

Posttranslational modification of proteins is important for targeting proteins to the correct
location. This step is defective in |-cell disease, which is characterized by a lack of mannose
residue phosphorylation, resulting in inappropriate trafficking of acid hydrolases to the
extracellular space instead of to lysosomes.
