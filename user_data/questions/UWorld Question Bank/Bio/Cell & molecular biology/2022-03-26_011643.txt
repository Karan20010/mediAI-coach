Cellular adhesion is the means by which one cell binds to another cell, surface, or matrix. The
integrins are a family of transmembrane protein receptors that interact with the extracellular
matrix by binding to specific proteins, including collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. Other
adhesion molecule classes include the cadherins, selectins, and lg superfamily members.

Fibronectins are large glycoproteins produced by fibroblasts and some epithelial cells.
Fibronectin binds to integrins, matrix collagen, and glycosaminoglycans, serving as a mediator
of cell adhesion and migration. Differential expression of integrin subtypes affects adhesion
properties of individual cells, and correlates with malignant behavior in a number of tumors,
including melanoma.
