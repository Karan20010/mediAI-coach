Protein synthesis is a process involving the following steps:

1. Transcription of DNA into pre-mRNA within the nucleus

2. Posttranscriptional modification (ie, pre-mRNA processing), including splicing of introns
and the addition of a 5' cap and poly-A tail

3. Translation of mRNA to protein at the ribosomes

4. Folding of the amino acid chain into a protein structure

5. Posttranslational modification and trafficking to the correct destinations

An error can occur at any of these stages and result in disease. Inclusion cell (I-cell)
disease is a defect in posttranslational modification in the Golgi body. Normally, proteins
designated for lysosomes are tagged with mannose-6-phosphate. However, in I-cell
disease, a defect in a phosphotransferase enzyme prevents phosphorylation of mannose.
Lysosomal acid hydrolases are therefore transported inappropriately to the extracellular
space, causing an increase in serum concentration and a decrease in intracellular
concentration, as seen in this patient. Without acid hydrolases to degrade cellular debris
within lysosomes, the waste products (eg, mucolipids, mucopolysaccharides) accumulate and
form inclusion bodies characteristic of the disease.
