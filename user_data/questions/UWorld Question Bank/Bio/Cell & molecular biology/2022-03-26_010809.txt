Every charged ion that the cell membrane is permeable attempts to push the resting
membrane potential of the cell toward its equilibrium potential. The resting membrane
potential can therefore be viewed as a combination of the equilibrium potentials of the ions that
can penetrate the cell membrane. Each permeable ion does not contribute equally to the
membrane potential; it is obvious that the resting membrane potential does not equal the
average of the different equilibrium potentials. The greater the permeability of a given ion, the
greater its contribution to the resting membrane potential will be. lons with little permeability
will contribute very little to the resting membrane potential. In the resting cell the permeability
of the membrane for K is much higher than that for Na. Outflow of K ions through non-gated
channels maintains the negative charge inside the membrane, which approaches the
equilibrium potential for K. There are, however, a small number of channels that allow the flow
of Na into the cell. This small influx of Na ions decreases the membrane potential, and for this
reason the resting potential of the membrane is always less negative than the equilibrium
potential for K (Choice A).
