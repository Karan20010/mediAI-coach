Ribosomes are cellular organelles that synthesize proteins. Each ribosome consists of 2
subunits. The small ribosomal 40S subunit is responsible for binding mRNA (the protein
synthesis template) and tRNA (carries amino acids). The larger 60S subunit contains peptidyl
transferase, the enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation between amino acids. All
ribosomes begin protein translation in the cytoplasm, but some translocate to the rough
endoplasmic reticulum (RER) during protein synthesis depending on the protein's target
destination.

¢ Free ribosomes remain floating in the cytosol throughout protein synthesis. They are
responsible for translating proteins found within the cytosol, nucleosol, peroxisome matrix,
and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (Choice D).

¢ Attached ribosomes bind to the RER after protein translation begins. They synthesize
most secretory proteins, the integral membrane proteins of the nucleus and cell
membrane, and proteins within the ER, Golgi network, and lysosomes.
The RER is particularly well developed in protein-secreting cells (eg, pancreatic and plasma
cells). Ribosomes attach to the RER via the translocon, a protein complex containing
ribophorins that bind the large 60S subunit.
