Acute and painless monocular vision loss is characteristic of central retinal artery occlusion
(CRAO). The vision loss includes the entire visual field and is often permanent. Funduscopic
findings include a pale retina (due to ischemia and edema) and a cherry-red macula (the
fovea and foveola are thin and have a separate blood supply from the choroid artery; the red
choroid is easily visible underneath).

The central retinal artery is a branch of the ophthalmic artery, which arises from the internal
carotid artery. Athero- and thromboembolism are the most common causes of CRAO.
Predisposing conditions include atrial fibrillation and carotid artery stenosis. CRAO may also
be caused by vasculitic diseases (eg, giant cell arteritis).
