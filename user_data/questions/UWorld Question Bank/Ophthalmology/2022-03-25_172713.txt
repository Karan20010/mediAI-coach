Educational objective:

Retinitis pigmentosa is a genetic condition resulting in progressive dystrophy of retinal
pigmented epithelium and photoreceptors. Patients typically present with progressive night
blindness and loss of peripheral vision due to early loss of rods, which are highly metabolically
active. Funduscopic examination may show dark pigments deposited in a bone-spicule
pattern in addition to retinal vessel attenuation and optic disc pallor.
