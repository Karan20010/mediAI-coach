are also known to cause increased pigmentation in the iris and eyelashes.

(Choices A, C, and E) Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (eg, dorzolamide) decrease formation of
bicarbonate in the ciliary body, leading to decreased sodium and fluid transport and
subsequently decreased production of aqueous humor. Alpha-adrenergic agonists (eg,
brimonidine) inhibit production of aqueous humor due to vasoconstriction in the ciliary body.
Beta blockers (eg, timolol) also decrease production of aqueous humor. Prostaglandins do not
affect production of aqueous humor but are often used in combination with these other agents.

(Choice B) Increased formation of new blood vessels at the optic disc is the characteristic
feature of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Strict control of diabetes will reduce the risk of
diabetic retinopathy, but it is not affected by topical prostaglandins.

Educational objective:

Glaucoma is a form of optic neuropathy characterized by increased intraocular pressure
associated with increased production or decreased outflow of aqueous humor. Topical
prostaglandins (eg, latanoprost) increase outflow of aqueous via the uveoscleral pathway and
are the preferred treatment for open-angle glaucoma.
