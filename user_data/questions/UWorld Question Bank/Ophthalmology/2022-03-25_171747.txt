Normal male erectile function involves interplay between psychological and physical
stimulation and the vascular, neurologic, and hormonal systems. On a vascular level, penile
erection is induced by increased blood flow to the corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum
accompanied by decreased outflow. Endothelial factors required for erection include formation
of nitric oxide, which induces formation of cyclic GMP (CGMP), which in turn mediates vascular
smooth muscle relaxation. cGMP is inactivated by cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) (ie,
PDES), which cleaves cGMP and terminates penile erection.

PDES inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil) are widely used, first-line agents for treatment of
erectile dysfunction (ED). PDE5S inhibitors increase activity of CGMP in the penile corpora,
leading to greater and more prolonged tumescence in men with ED.

However, PDE5S inhibitors can also inhibit PDE6 in the retina, which is involved in color vision.
Patients experience this effect as a transient bluish discoloration to vision. Less common
ocular effects of PDES inhibitors include nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,
which presents with sudden monocular vision loss associated with an afferent pupillary defect,
decreased visual acuity, and optic disc edema.
