This patient has cataracts: progressive opacification of the lenses with chronic loss of visual
acuity. Scattering of light within the lens leads to glare and halos around bright lights,
especially at night. Examination reveals cloudiness in the lens, decreased detail when
examining the retina, and loss of the red reflex.

Transparency of the lens requires an ordered epithelial cell structure and maintenance of
intracellular crystallins. Aging and environmental stressors can disrupt transparency and
contribute to cataract formation through the following mechanisms:

¢ Nuclear sclerosis: new layers of epithelia form on the cortex of the lens, compacting older
layers beneath

¢ Photooxidative damage and cross-linking of crystallins causes brown/yellow pigmentary
changes

¢ Osmotic injury resulting in development of hydropic lens fibers that degenerate

Cumulative photooxidative stress is worsened by heavy UV exposure (eg, outdoor
occupations), smoking, or ionizing radiation. Likewise, osmotic injury is accelerated in patients
with diabetes mellitus. A disordered balance of prooxidative versus antioxidative compounds
in the lens (eg, decreased glutathione) may also contribute.
