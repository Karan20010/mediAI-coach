(Choice A) The anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) can cause
dry eye, blurred vision, and triggering of angle-closure glaucoma (ie, ocular pain, headache,
unilateral vision loss). Discoloration of vision is not typical.

(Choice B) Important side effects of statins (eg, atorvastatin) include myopathy and hepatic
toxicity. Statins may have a small effect on the risk of cataract but otherwise have few ocular
manifestations.

(Choice C) Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (eg, canagliflozin) induce increased
renal excretion of glucose and water. Most of the side effects (eg, hypotension, urinary tract
infection) are related to glucosuria and fluid shifts; visual symptoms are not common.

(Choice D) Metformin most commonly causes gastrointestinal side effects (eg, nausea,
diarrhea). Lactic acidosis is a potentially serious but rare complication. Visual side effects are
not a significant concern.

(Choice E) Side effects of ACE inhibitors (eg, ramipril) are primarily related to renal function
(eg, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury) or blood pressure (eg, dizziness, hypotension).
Patients may also develop a dry cough due to an increase in circulating bradykinin.
