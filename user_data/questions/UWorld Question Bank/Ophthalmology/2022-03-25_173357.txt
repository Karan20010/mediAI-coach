This patient likely has age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of
blindness in industrialized countries. AMD occurs in genetically predisposed individuals as a
result of advancing age and environmental factors (eg, smoking) and is classified into dry and
wet subtypes. Dry AMD is characterized by gradual vision loss in one or both eyes and can
cause difficulty with driving/reading. The condition likely results from chronic oxidative damage
to the retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris, leading to subretinal inflammation with
abnormal extracellular matrix formation (eg, confluent drusen, basement membrane
thickening). These changes appear on funduscopy as subretinal drusen deposits with pigment
abnormalities.
