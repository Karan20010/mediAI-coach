DR is categorized as follows:

Nonproliferative (early disease): The earliest morphologic changes include thickening of
the basement membrane and failure of the blood-retinal barrier. Increased permeability
allows leakage of fluid into the retina (macular edema), which can distort vision and leave
behind lipid-rich deposits (hard exudates). Arteriolar obstruction causes ischemic injury to
the retina, which manifests as cotton-wool spots. Other findings include microaneurysms
and dot-blot hemorrhages (due to microaneurysm rupture).

Proliferative (advanced disease): Progressive retinal ischemia stimulates production of
angiogenic factors (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor), leading to formation of new
retinal vessels (neovascularization). The new vessels are fragile and often extend into
the adjacent vitreous. Traction from the vitreous can cause detachment of the retina or
laceration of the vessels, leading to acute hemorrhage and vision loss.
