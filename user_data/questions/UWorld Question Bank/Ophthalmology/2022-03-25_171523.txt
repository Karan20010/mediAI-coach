Retinoblastoma is the most common ocular tumor of childhood. It usually presents with a
white pupillary reflex (leukocoria) in children <5 years old. Approximately 60% of
retinoblastomas are sporadic (usually unilateral), while 40% are familial (often, but not always,
bilateral).

Familial retinoblastoma occurs due to a germline mutation that affects the Rb tumor
suppressor gene on chromosome 13; affected children carry one copy of the mutation in all
their cells. However, there are two copies of the Rb gene (one allele from each parent), and
malignancy does not occur while at least one copy of the gene is still functional. A somatic
second mutation acquired early in life is the "second hit" that leads to retinoblastoma, as cells
with two inactivated Rb genes proliferate uncontrollably and give rise to malignancy.

Children with familial retinoblastoma often acquire other "second hit" mutations later in life,
leading to additional tumors, usually sarcomas such as osteosarcoma. In contrast, patients
with sporadic retinoblastoma are not at risk for other malignancies, as the chance of two
acquired somatic mutations occuring multiple times in different cell lineages is very low.
