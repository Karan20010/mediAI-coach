A 67-year-old smoker comes to the office with a 2-week history of decreased vision in his right

eye that he describes as "blurry" and "distorted." The patient has been having vision problems

over the past year, and these have made it more difficult to drive and require that he use a

bright light to read the newspaper. He has no history of diabetes mellitus or hypertension.
