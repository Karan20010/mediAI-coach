A 75-year-old man comes to the office due to a 2-year history of slowly worsening vision in

both eyes. The symptoms are worse at night and the patient has stopped driving at night due

to excessive glare from oncoming headlights. He has worked his entire life as a farmer and

continues to drive tractors and other farm equipment during the day without difficulty. Medical

history is unremarkable. Ocular examination shows loss of the red reflex and poor

visualization of retinal detail. Acuity testing shows 20/100 vision in both eyes; visual field

testing is normal. Which of the following is the most likely etiologic factor for this patient's eye

condition?
