Macular lesions impair central vision and result in central scotomata (Choice E). The term
scotoma refers to any visual defect surrounded by a relatively unimpaired field of vision.
Scotomas occur due to pathologic processes that involve parts of the retina or optic nerve.
Examples of such processes include demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis,
diabetic retinopathy and retinitis pigmentosa. Pathologic processes that involve the entire

optic nerve lead to monocular blindness.

The patient described in this clinical vignette is likely to have macular degeneration (MD). This
disorder is frequently age-related, and is the most common cause of blindness in people over
50 years old in the US. Macular degeneration is characterized by progressive loss of central
vision due to deposition of fatty tissue (drusen) behind the retina (dry MD) and
neovascularization of the retina (wet MD).
