TPN = total parenteral nutrition.

This patient has Candida endophthalmitis, a purulent infection of the structures and (usually)
fluid chambers of the eye. Although molds such as Aspergillus or Fusarium generally spread
to the eye via direct extension following surgery or trauma, yeasts such as Candida typically
infect the eye via hematogenous dissemination in the setting of fungemia. Candida first
seeds the highly vascular choroid layer and then spreads to the retina and fluid chambers.

Most cases occur in hospitalized patients with a central venous catheter, which allows
commensal Candida organisms from the skin to enter the bloodstream. The risk is further
increased by total parenteral nutrition, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, recent abdominal
surgery, and immunocompromise (eg, neutropenia, glucocorticoid therapy).

Manifestations of Candida endophthalmitis are often unilateral and include floaters and a
progressive loss in vision. Eye pain does not typically occur until late in the disease
course. The patient may feel well and be otherwise asymptomatic or may have systemic
symptoms (eg, fever) due to fungemia. Blood cultures should be obtained, but vitreous fluid
sampling is usually required for diagnosis.
