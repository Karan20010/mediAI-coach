Damage to the visual pathway produces distinct types of visual field defects depending on the
location of the lesion. Visual perception begins with light from the nasal visual fields striking
the temporal side of each retina and light from the temporal visual fields striking the nasal side
of each retina. Information from the retina is then transmitted by the optic nerves to the optic
chiasm. At the optic chiasm, optic nerve fibers from the nasal half of each retina cross and
project into the contralateral optic tract. In contrast, nerve fibers from the temporal parts pass
into the ipsilateral optic tract. The optic tract thus contains nerve fibers from the temporal part
of the ipsilateral retina and the nasal part of the contralateral retina. Optic tract fibers project
mainly to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), but also project to superior colliculus (reflex
gaze), pretectal area (light reflex), and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (circadian rhythms).

Axons from the LGN that project to the striate (primary visual) cortex are known as the optic
radiation (or geniculocalcarine tract). The lower fibers of the optic radiation carry information
from the lower retina (upper contralateral visual field) and take a circuitous route anteriorly into
the temporal lobe (Meyer's loop) before reaching the lingual gyrus of the striate cortex. The
upper fibers of the optic radiation carry information from the upper retina (lower contralateral
visual field) and pass more directly from the LGN through the parietal lobe to reach the cuneus

gyrus of the striate cortex.
