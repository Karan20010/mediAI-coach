This patient is presenting with angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) that was precipitated by use of
over-the-counter eye drops. ACG typically occurs in patients with a predisposing narrow
chamber angle and develops when the normal drainage pathway of aqueous humor becomes
blocked.

Aqueous humor is produced by the ciliary body and flows from the posterior chamber of the
eye through the pupil into the anterior chamber and out of the eye via the trabecular network.
In susceptible individuals, dilation of the pupil causes the iris to press against the anterior
surface of the lens. This limits flow of aqueous humor through the pupil, causing the iris to
bulge forward. The corresponding reduction (closing) of the iridocorneal angle blocks drainage
of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork.

Acute ACG may be precipitated by topical and systemic medications that cause pupillary
dilation, such as alpha-adrenergic agonists (eg, naphazoline) and drugs with strong
anticholinergic effects (eg, tricyclic antidepressants, antihistamines). Acute blockage results
in a rapid rise in intraocular pressure that typically causes severe eye pain, conjunctival
injection, and corneal edema (haziness). If not corrected, the elevated pressure can
damage the optic nerve and cause permanent vision impairment.
