This patient has an acute retinal hemorrhage (arrow), most likely caused by severe, poorly
controlled hypertension. Hypertensive retinal hemorrhage typically causes painless,
unilateral visual disturbances, ranging from mild obscuration without loss of visual acuity to
permanent blindness. Severe hypertension in retinal precapillary arterioles causes endothelial
disruption, leakage of plasma into the arteriolar wall, and fibrinous necrosis. The necrotic
vessels can then bleed into the nerve fiber layers, causing dot- and flame-shaped
hemorrhages.

Diagnosis of hypertensive retinal hemorrhage is usually confirmed by direct ophthalmoscopic
evaluation. Other findings of hypertensive retinopathy include thickening of the arteriolar walls
("copper or silver wiring"), compression of the associated veins (arteriovenous nicking), and
small, white foci of retinal ischemia (cotton-wool spots).
