This patient, with painless vision loss and retinal neovascularization, has proliferative diabetic
retinopathy (DR). DR is a result of chronic hyperglycemic injury to the small retinal vessels
and is considered a microangiopathic complication of diabetes (along with neuropathy and
nephropathy). The prevalence of DR is proportionate to the duration of diabetes and severity

of hyperglycemia over time; tight control of diabetes is associated with a lower long-term risk of
DR.
