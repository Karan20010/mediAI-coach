(Choice F) Penicillin G is used to treat ocular (and neuro-) syphilis. Ocular syphilis often
presents as uveitis but can cause retinitis, which usually appears as ground-glass lesions with
significant vitreal inflammation. Most patients also have manifestations of syphilitic meningitis
(eg, headache, vomiting).

Educational objective:

Cytomegalovirus retinitis is the most common cause of ocular disease in patients with
untreated AIDS who have CD4 counts <50/mm:. Diagnosis is made by funduscopy, which
typically reveals yellow-white, fluffy retinal lesions near the retinal vessels with associated
hemorrhage. Treatment with ganciclovir is required to prevent blindness.
