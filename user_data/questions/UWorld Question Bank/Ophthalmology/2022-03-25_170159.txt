Lesions in the temporal lobe can disrupt Meyer's loop and produce a contralateral superior
quadrantanopia. Temporal lobe lesions can also produce other neurologic manifestations,
including aphasia (dominant hemisphere lesions), memory deficits, seizures (complex partial
and tonic-clonic), and hallucinations (auditory, olfactory, and visual).

Educational objective:
Injury to Meyer's loop in the temporal lobe results in contralateral superior quadrantanopia.
