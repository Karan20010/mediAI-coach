history of seasonal allergies and developed itchy, watery, red eyes after working outdoors in
her garden. The patient used over-the-counter eye drops to treat her allergy symptoms, and
several hours later, she began experiencing severe right eye pain and headache. On
examination, the right eye appears red with a hazy cornea and dilated pupil that responds
poorly to light. Palpation of the globes reveals notable firmness on the right compared to the

intraocular pressure. Which of the following medications was most likely used by this patient?
