(Choice E) Retinal ischemia can manifest with painless transient monocular vision loss
(amaurosis fugax) and is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic emboli originating from the
ipsilateral carotid artery. Funduscopy may show embolic plaques and retinal whitening caused
by ischemia. This condition typically affects older patients with vascular risk factors (eg,
hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus).

Educational objective:

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri) presents in young obese women
with daily headache (which worsens during the Valsalva maneuver), bilaterally symmetric
papilledema, and transient visual disturbances. Increased intracranial pressure compresses
the optic nerves, resulting in impaired axoplasmic flow and optic disc edema.
