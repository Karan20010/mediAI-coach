Skin rhytides (wrinkles) are also directly caused by chronological aging (with a contribution
from the harmful effects of ultraviolet light). With aging, skin becomes atrophic and fragile,
with reduced elasticity and subdermal fat. There is dermal and epidermal thinning, flattening
of the dermoepidermal junction, a decreased number of fibroblasts, and reduced synthesis and
increased breakdown of collagen and elastin.
