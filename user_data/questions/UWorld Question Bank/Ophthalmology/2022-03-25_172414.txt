(Choice A) Glaucoma, most commonly due to chronically elevated intraocular pressure, is
characterized by optic neuropathy, as evidenced by optic cupping seen on funduscopic
examination. Visual acuity may be affected but is a late manifestation after progressive loss of
peripheral vision, which is normal in this patient.

(Choice B) Untreated strabismus (misalignment of the eyes) in early childhood can cause
unilateral visual cortex suppression to avoid diplopia and eventually lead to amblyopia
(decreased visual acuity). This patient's recent symptom onset and normal extraocular
movements make this diagnosis unlikely.

(Choice D) Presbyopia is a nonrefractive error that increases with age due to the loss of
accommodating power of the lens from decreased elasticity. Blurry vision of nearby objects
typically develops in patients age >40.

(Choice E) Hyperopia (farsightedness) is a refractive error characterized by a reduced
anterior-posterior diameter of the eye, causing the focal point of the refracted image to be
positioned posterior to the retina. In contrast to myopia, hyperopia causes blurred vision of
nearby objects and is corrected by a converging (convex) lens.
