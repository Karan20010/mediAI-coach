Educational objective:

Cataracts are characterized by progressive opacification of the lens with chronic loss of visual
acuity. Aging and environmental exposures (eg, UV light) contribute to cataract formation by
inducing nuclear sclerosis, photooxidative damage to lens crystallins, and osmotic injury.
