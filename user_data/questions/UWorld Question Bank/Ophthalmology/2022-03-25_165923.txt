The image demonstrates a Kayser-Fleischer ring, an ophthalmologic finding most strongly
associated with Wilson's disease (although it can also be seen in chronic cholestatic diseases
such as primary biliary cirrhosis). Kayser-Fleischer rings are best identified on slit-lamp
examination, but they can be observed grossly, especially with long-standing, untreated
disease. The rings are formed through the granular deposition of copper within Descemet's
membrane in the cornea.

Wilson's disease is a rare, autosomal recessive disease most often identified in individuals 5-
40 years old. The genetic mutations associated with Wilson's disease hinder copper
metabolism by reducing the formation and secretion of ceruloplasmin and decreasing hepatic
secretion of copper into the biliary system. Copper is a pro-oxidant and causes damage to
hepatic tissue through the generation of free radicals. Eventually, it leaks from injured
hepatocytes into the circulation to be deposited in various tissues, including the cornea and
basal ganglia. Atrophy of the basal ganglia then ensues.

Treatment is life-long and focuses on removing accumulated copper in the tissues and
preventing its re-accumulation. First-line medications include copper chelators such as d-
penicillamine and trientine.
