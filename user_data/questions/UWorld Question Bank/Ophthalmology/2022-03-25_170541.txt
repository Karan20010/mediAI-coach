Patients with untreated AIDS who have CD4 counts <50/mm: are at high risk for
cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. Suspicion is often raised when a patient with advanced
AIDS develops slowly progressive blurred vision, scotoma (blind spots), floaters, or photopsia
(flashing lights). Although most cases are thought to arise due to hematogenous
dissemination of CMV, serum testing for the virus is often (~50%) negative. Therefore, the
diagnosis is typically established when funduscopy reveals yellow-white, fluffy retinal
lesions near the retinal vessels associated with hemorrhage.

Treatment is required to prevent progression and blindness. Ganciclovir, a guanine
nucleoside analogue that is structurally similar to acyclovir but expresses greater activity
against CMV DNA polymerase, is first-line therapy. Patients are also typically started on
antiretroviral therapy to increase CD4 count. A major complication of CMV retinitis is retinal
detachment due to the replacement of damaged retina with thin, atrophic scar tissue (which is
prone to tear).
