(Choice A) Anticholinergic medications (cycloplegics) reduce pain and prevent the formation
of adhesions in iridocyclitis (uveitis). Atropine does not precipitate iridocyclitis.

(Choices B, E, F, G, and H) These conditions present with either loss of vision or visual
disturbances. They are usually not painful and would not be affected by anticholinergic drugs.

Educational objective:

Atropine is indicated for the treatment of bradycardia as it decreases vagal influence on the SA
and AV nodes. Acommon side effect is increased intraocular pressure. It may precipitate
acute closed-angle glaucoma in susceptible individuals.
