This patient with a traumatic ocular injury has developed granulomatous inflammation of
the contralateral eye, a condition known as sympathetic ophthalmia. This occurs when there
is a robust T-cell response to previously sequestered antigens in the eye, an area that
displays immune privilege.

Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) have inherent immune privilege, in which
inflammation is inhibited by multiple mechanisms (eg, physical barriers, lack of lymphatics, low
expression of MHC class la); this helps limit potential organ damage that may result from a
robust inflammatory response.

Self-antigens located in immune-privileged sites can be recognized by T cells that escape
negative selection in the thymus. Therefore, if these self-antigens are released into the
lymphatic system as a result of trauma, T cells may recognize these self-antigens as
foreign and mount a response in both the injured eye and the contralateral eye. Bacterial
introduction and exposure during trauma may upregulate the inflammatory process, increasing
the chances that these autoreactive T cells will develop.

Because of this potential sight-threatening immune response, if an eye is severely injured with
no possibility that vision will be restored, it is enucleated (ie, surgically removed) to prevent
blindness in the uninjured eye.
