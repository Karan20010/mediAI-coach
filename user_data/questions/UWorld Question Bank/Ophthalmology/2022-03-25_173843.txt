This patient has impaired visual accommodation due to anticholinergic (anti-muscarinic)
effects of first-generation antihistamines (eg, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine).
Antihistamines are designed to relieve the allergic symptoms caused by release of histamine
from mast cells (eg, rhinorrhea, itchy eyes and nose, urticaria). However, first-generation
antihistamines can have prominent side effects due to blockade of other receptors, including
alpha-adrenergic, serotonergic, and cholinergic receptors.

The ciliary muscle attaches to the lens via the zonular fibers. Contraction of the muscle
reduces tension on the fibers, allowing the lens to become more spherical and increasing its
refractive power. The ciliary muscle is under parasympathetic control from the Edinger-
Westphal nucleus/ciliary ganglion. Inhibition of this pathway by antimuscarinic agents will limit
accommodation and cause blurring of vision for close objects. The pupillary sphincter also
receives parasympathetic innervation from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, and patients on
antimuscarinic agents may have mydriasis (pupillary dilation) as well.
