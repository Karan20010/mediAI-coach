(Choice A) Choroidal inflammation is characteristic of posterior uveitis, which typically
presents with painless vision loss and floaters. Ophthalmic examination may show
inflammation/leukocytes in the vitreous humor. Uveitis is often associated with systemic
inflammatory disorders (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, ankylosing spondylitis).

(Choice C) An acute increase in intraocular pressure is characteristic of angle-closure
glaucoma, which typically presents with painful monocular vision loss, headache, vomiting,
and conjunctival injection with a poorly reactive middilated pupil. Chronic increases in
intraocular pressure can cause optic disc cupping due to atrophy of the optic nerve head.
Glaucoma usually affects older individuals.

(Choice D) Optic neuritis is frequently associated with multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating
CNS disease that typically affects women age 15-50. Although swelling of the optic disc can
be present on funduscopy, optic neuritis usually causes sustained monocular vision loss over
several weeks with painful eye movement rather than daily headaches with transient bilateral

vision loss.
(Choice E) Retinal ischemia can manifest with painless transient monocular vision loss
(amaurosis fugax) and is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic emboli originating from the
