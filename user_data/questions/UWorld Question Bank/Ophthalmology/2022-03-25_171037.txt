Educational objective:

Severe hypertension in retinal precapillary arterioles causes endothelial disruption, leakage of
plasma into the arteriolar wall, and fibrinous necrosis. The necrotic vessels can then bleed
into the nerve fiber layer, which can be seen on examination as dot- or flame-shaped
hemorrhages.
