The improvement in this patient's mild myopia is likely due to age-related changes. Normally,
in accommodation, when focusing on near objects (eg, reading), ciliary muscle contraction
relaxes the zonular fibers, allowing the lens to become more convex so the image focuses on
the retina.

Starting around age 40-50, almost all individuals develop an inability to focus on near objects.
In this condition, called presbyopia, progressive denaturation of lens proteins and changes in
lens curvature cause the lens to become less elastic and lose its accommodating power. In
most patients, this causes the image of near objects to focus behind the retina resulting in
difficulty reading fine print and the need to hold objects farther away in order to see them
clearly. However, in patients with mild myopia (increased axial length with an image focused
in front of the retina), presbyopia can compensate for myopia by displacing the image
backward, so that it focuses on the retina. These patients often note improvement in visual

acuity with age as presbyopia develops.
