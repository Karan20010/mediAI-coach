(Choice A) Age-related macular degeneration presents with slowly progressive central vision
loss. It is due to oxidative damage to the pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris with
abnormal extracellular matrix formation (drusen). In late-stage disease, patients may develop
neovascularization ("wet" macular degeneration), but associated findings include subretinal

drusen and pigment abnormalities.

(Choice C) Open-angle glaucoma is a form of optic neuropathy, characterized by ganglion
cell death in association with elevated intraocular pressure. It causes insidious loss of
peripheral vision; examination findings include enlargement of the retinal cup and a pale optic
disc with thinning of the rim.

(Choice D) Atheroembolic retinal artery occlusion presents with acute monocular vision loss.
Examination findings include retinal pallor and a cherry red spot at the macula.

(Choice E) Hypertensive retinopathy can manifest with retinal hemorrhages, cotton-wool
spots, and hard exudates. However, the thickened and stiffened arterial walls are typically
visible as arteriolar narrowing and impingement on the veins where they are crossed by
arteries (arteriovenous nicking).
