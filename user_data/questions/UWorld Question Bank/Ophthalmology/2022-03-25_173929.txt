(Choice B) First-generation antihistamines easily cross the blood-brain barrier into the central
nervous system, where they interfere with the normal neurotransmitter functions of histamine.
Side effects can include drowsiness and cognitive dysfunction.

(Choice C) Leukotrienes are inflammatory mediators that contribute to nasal, ocular, and
respiratory symptoms in patients with allergic disorders and asthma. Antihistamines do not
interfere with leukotriene formation or action.

(Choice D) Alpha-adrenergic blockade causes peripheral vasodilation, resulting in
hypotension and postural dizziness.

(Choice E) Serotonin receptor blockade by antihistamines causes appetite stimulation and
weight gain.

Educational objective:

In addition to blocking histamine receptors, first-generation antihistamines (eg,
chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) have antimuscarinic, anti-alpha adrenergic, and anti-
serotonergic properties. Anticholinergic effects on the ocular ciliary muscles impair
accommodation and cause blurring of vision for close objects.
