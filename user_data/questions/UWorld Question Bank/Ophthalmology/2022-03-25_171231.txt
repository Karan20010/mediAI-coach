This patient has internuclear ophthalmoplegia, a disorder of impaired horizontal gaze caused
by damage to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The frontal eye field initiates
horizontal gaze through the contralateral abducens (CN VI) nucleus, which communicates with
the ipsilateral oculomotor (CN III) nucleus by way of the MLF. This allows for simultaneous
activation of the lateral rectus muscle in the contralateral eye (abduction) and the medial
rectus muscle in the ipsilateral eye (adduction), resulting in coordinated conjugate horizontal
gaze.

Unilateral MLF lesions typically occur in older patients with lacunar strokes in the dorsal pons
or midbrain (pontine artery distribution) and result in impaired adduction of the ipsilateral
eye during horizontal gaze, causing diplopia. Abduction in the contralateral eye is preserved
(but often with gaze-evoked nystagmus). The pathways for convergence and the pupillary
light reflex bypass the MLF lesion, so these reflexes are generally preserved.
