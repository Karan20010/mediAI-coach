(Choice A) Viral conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by adenovirus. It typically presents
with monocular conjunctival erythema and eye discomfort; scattered skin vesicles and corneal
ulcerations would not be seen.

(Choice B) Hematogenous dissemination of Candida albicans can cause fungal

endophthalmitis. The fungus typically seeds the highly vascular choroid then spreads to the
retina and fluid chambers, manifesting as floaters and progressively decreasing vision. Eye
pain is rare until late in the disease process, and corneal ulceration does not typically occur.

(Choices C and D) Herpes simplex virus is a common cause of keratitis and can occur in
healthy adults, although immunodeficiency increases the risk. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a
common cause of bacterial keratitis, especially in contact lens users. Both can cause corneal
ulceration, leading to eye pain, redness, and decreased vision. However, neither causes a
vesicular, dermatomal rash.

Educational objective:

Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is caused by reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the
ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1). It is characterized by a painful,
dermatomal rash and ocular involvement (eg, acute keratitis, corneal ulceration). It most
commonly occurs in elderly and immunosuppressed patients.
