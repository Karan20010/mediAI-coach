This infant born at 29 weeks gestation has abnormal retinal vascularization extending into
the vitreous, findings diagnostic of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). This condition,
exclusive to premature neonates, is a leading cause of severe visual impairment and
blindness.

In utero, the relatively low oxygen tension normally causes upregulation of proangiogenic
factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); these growth factors stimulate
normal vessel growth. Premature birth disrupts this process as follows:

¢ The relatively hyperoxic environment (even in room air) after delivery leads to
downregulation of VEGF and slowing or arrest of retinal vascular growth.

¢ Once the retina begins to mature (over subsequent weeks), increased metabolic demand
causes relative retinal hypoxia, which again stimulates VEGF. This often results in
aberrant new vessel formation (neovascularization), which can lead to retinal scarring
and/or detachment if severe.
