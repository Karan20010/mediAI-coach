acquired somatic mutations occuring multiple times in different cell lineages is very low.

(Choice A) Patients with Down syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and neurofibromatosis type 1
have an increased risk of development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is not
associated with familial retinoblastoma.

(Choice B) Neuroblastoma is a common childhood cancer that arises from sympathetic
nervous tissue, most commonly in the adrenals. Most cases are sporadic.

(Choice C) Ewing sarcoma is an undifferentiated neoplasm of mesenchymal origin that most
commonly occurs in the long and flat bones of children and adolescents. It occurs
sporadically.

(Choice E) Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood,
typically arising in the cerebellum.

Familial retinoblastoma occurs as a result of mutations of each of the two Rb genes ("two

later in life.
