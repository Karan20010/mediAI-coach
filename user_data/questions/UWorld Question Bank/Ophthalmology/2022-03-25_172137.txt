This patient has herpes zoster ophthalmicus, a condition caused by reactivation of latent
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) in the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V1).

Following primary VZV infection (ie, chickenpox), the virus is transported retrograde along
sensory nerves to cranial nerve and dorsal spinal ganglia, where it lies dormant for years.
Reactivation of the virus most commonly occurs in elderly or immunosuppressed patients and
typically causes sensory disturbances (eg, burning or shooting pains) and eruption of a painful
rash (eg, scattered vesicles) in the associated dermatome (eg, unilateral forehead, side of
the nose, periorbital area). A prodrome of systemic symptoms (eg, headache, malaise, fever)
can also occur.

Because CN V1 also conveys sensory innervation of the cornea (sensory limb of the
corneal/blink reflex), involvement can cause acute keratitis (ie, corneal inflammation) and
corneal ulceration (eg, linear, branching ulcerations on fluorescein stain). Involvement of the
side or tip of the nose (ie, Hutchinson sign) correlates highly with ocular involvement because
the nasociliary branch of CN V1 innervates both the eye and the side/tip of the nose.
