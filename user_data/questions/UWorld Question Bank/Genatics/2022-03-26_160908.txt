A 26-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up. The patient and her husband want to
have a child, and she inquires about the risk of certain genetic conditions, including cystic
fibrosis (CF). The patient is from a small city with a stable Caucasian population, where the
carrier frequency for CF is 1/30 Caucasian individuals. Her husband is from a nearby
community, where CF carrier frequency in individuals of Asian descent is 1/100. Both the
patient, who is Caucasian, and her husband, who is of Asian descent, are healthy. What is the
probability that a child born to a mother from the Caucasian community and a father from the
Asian community will have the disease?
