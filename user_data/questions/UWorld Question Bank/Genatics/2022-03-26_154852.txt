(Choice F) The occurrence of multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic manifestations (often
in different organ systems as a result of a single genetic defect) is termed pleiotrophy.
Although this may apply to features of oculocutaneous albinism (eg, absence of melanin in
skin, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus), it does not explain why a child of two affected parents
would be unaffected.

Educational objective:
Locus heterogeneity describes when a similar phenotype is produced by mutations in different
genetic loci (eg, oculocutaneous albinism).
