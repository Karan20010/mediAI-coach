Down syndrome (trisomy 21) is the most common trisomy in liveborn infants. The diagnosis
is often suspected by prenatal screening (eg, decreased maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein
[AFP]) and/or ultrasonography (eg, increased nuchal translucency) and confirmed by
chorionic villous sampling or amniocentesis. Most cases are caused by meiotic nondisjunction
due to maternal age >35, which result in 3 complete copies of chromosome 21.

Duodenal atresia, the failure of recanalization of the duodenum in early gestation, is the most
common gastrointestinal abnormality associated with Down syndrome. Infants present during
the first few days of life with bilious emesis and the classic "double-bubble" sign, which
represents the dilated stomach and proximal duodenum. Patients with Down syndrome are
also at risk for imperforate anus, Hirschsprung disease, tracheoesophageal fistula, and celiac
disease.

(Choice B) Holoprosencephaly, a severe developmental defect of the forebrain

(prosencephalon), is associated with trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). Additional features include

microcephaly, microphthalmia, cleft lip/palate, and intellectual disability.

(Choices C and E) Markedly elevated AFP levels are associated with open neural tube and
ventral wall defects (omphalocele, gastroschisis). Myelomeningocele is associated with
trisomy 18, and omphalocele is associated with trisomies 13 and 18.
