Educational objective:

Anticipation describes an inherited condition that presents earlier and with more severe
disease in successive generations. In myotonic dystrophy, increasing length of the pathogenic
trinucleotide repeat expansion accounts for severe hypotonia in a neonate (congenital) and
mild symptoms (eg, myotonia, facial weakness) in a parent (classic [adult]).
