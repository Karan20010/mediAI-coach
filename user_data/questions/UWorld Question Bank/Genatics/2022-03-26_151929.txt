The pedigree shows that only males are affected by the drug intolerance. Specifically, male
offspring of unaffected parents are affected. There is no evidence of male-to-male
transmission. This pattern is most consistent with X-linked recessive inheritance from an
asymptomatic carrier female in the first generation. In X-linked recessive inheritance:

1. Affected males will always produce unaffected sons and carrier daughters.
2. Carrier females have a 50% chance of producing an affected son or carrier daughter.

G6PD deficiency, which causes acute hemolytic anemia on exposure to oxidant drugs,
follows an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance.

(Choice A) With autosomal dominant inheritance, affected individuals have at least 1 parent
that is also affected.

(Choice B) In autosomal recessive inheritance, both parents must at least be carriers
(heterozygous) for the mutation in order to produce affected offspring. However, the father of
the marked individual comes from outside the family and would be unlikely to carry the
mutation (the question states the mutation is rare in the general population).

(Choice C) In X-linked dominant inheritance, affected individuals have at least 1 parent (of

either sex) that is also affected. An affected male will always produce affected daughters, but
