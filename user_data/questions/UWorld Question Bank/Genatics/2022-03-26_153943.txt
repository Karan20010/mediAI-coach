(Choice B) 5'—3' exonuclease activity is needed during the synthesis of both daughter
strands to remove RNA primers (although there are many more primers on the lagging strand,
primers must also be removed when joining leading strands from separate origins of
replication). In addition, 5'3' exonuclease activity is necessary to correct DNA replication
errors that occur on both strands.

(Choice C) DNA polymerases have 3'—5' exonuclease activity (proofreading function) that
allows them to reverse direction and remove incorrectly placed bases. This process occurs on
both newly formed daughter strands to help reduce replication errors.

(Choice D) DNA polymerases do not have 3'—5' polymerase activity; all known polymerases
synthesize in the 5'—3' direction.

(Choice E) Before DNA polymerase can initiate DNA synthesis, RNA primers must first be
synthesized by the enzyme primase (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase). This process is
necessary for synthesis of both daughter strands (even though it occurs much more frequently
on the lagging strand).

Educational objective:
DNA synthesis can occur only in the 5'3' direction. Okazaki fragments are short stretches of

newly synthesized DNA that are separated by RNA primers. They are formed by the
Block Time Elapse
