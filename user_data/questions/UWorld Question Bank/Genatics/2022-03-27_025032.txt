Types of DNA mutations

Silent

Base substitution codes for same amino acid

Missense

Base substitution codes for different amino acid

Conservative

Base substitution codes for different amino acid with similar chemical structure

Nonsense | Base substitution introduces premature stop codon

Nonstop Base substitution within stop codon results in continued translation
Splice site | Mutation at splice site alters intron removal from pre-mRNA
Frameshift | Deletion/insertion of bases causes downstream misreading
