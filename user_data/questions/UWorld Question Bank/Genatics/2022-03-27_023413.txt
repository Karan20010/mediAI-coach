(Choice D) Imprinting refers to gene expression from only one parental allele, rather than
from both. A mutation in the preferentially expressed allele can result in Prader-Willi syndrome
(PWS) or Angelman syndrome. PWS is caused by a paternally-inherited deletion of part of
chromosome 15 while the maternal allele is not expressed. In contrast, Angelman syndrome is
caused by a maternally-inherited deletion of the same portion of chromosome 15 while the
paternal allele is not expressed.

(Choice E) Defects in DNA mismatch repair genes cause Lynch syndrome, a condition
characterized by an increased risk of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and
extraintestinal malignancies (eg, endometrial cancer).

Educational objective:

Fragile X syndrome is caused by an increased number of CGG trinucleotide repeats on the
fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR7) gene on the long arm of the X chromosome. This leads
to hypermethylation and inactivation of FMR7.
