This karyotype shows trisomy 21 (47, XY, +21), which is diagnostic for Down syndrome. This
condition usually results from meiotic nondisjunction in the ovum, with advanced maternal age
(age 235) as a risk factor. Prenatal diagnosis is often suspected based on associated
ultrasound findings, including a thickened nuchal fold, cardiac septal defects, and/or
gastrointestinal abnormalities (eg, duodenal atresia).

Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. In addition, Down
syndrome significantly increases the risk of childhood hematologic malignancies, including
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (most common leukemia in patients with Down syndrome)
and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. The pathogenesis of the increased leukemia risk is
uncertain, but may involve increased chromosome 21 gene expression promoting overall
genomic instability.

(Choice B) Patients with Fanconi anemia, not Down syndrome, develop bone marrow failure
(aplastic anemia) due to an inherited mutation that causes defective DNA repair. Karyotype
analysis would be normal in this condition.

(Choice C) Chronic myelogenous leukemia is commonly associated with a reciprocal
translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 (ie, Philadelphia
chromosome). This translocation fuses the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the ABL gene on
