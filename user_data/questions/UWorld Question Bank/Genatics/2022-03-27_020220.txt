A 32-year-old man is recovering from extensive burns. Fibroblasts near the site of injury
actively synthesize precursor mRNA to be used as templates for protein synthesis. After
transcription, extensive processing of the precursor RNA occurs to form the finalized mRNA
sequence. The finalized mRNA then exits the nucleus and undergoes translation by ribosome
complexes before being degraded. Which of the following steps involving the processing and
handling of mRNA occurs only within the cytoplasm of cells?

A. 5'-terminal guanosine triphosphate addition (6%)

B. Methylation of the 5'-terminal guanine (13%)

C. Multiple adenine nucleotide attachment to the 3'-end (11%)
D. Interaction with snRNP (14%)

E. Removal of intervening sequences (8%)
