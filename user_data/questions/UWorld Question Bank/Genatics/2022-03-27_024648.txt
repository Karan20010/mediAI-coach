Dysmorphic features of Down syndrome include epicanthal folds, upslanting palpebral
fissures, a protruding tongue, and excessive skin at the nape of the neck. Birth weight and
length are often below average, and hypotonia and a weak startle (Moro) reflex are
characteristic. Cardiac defects are present in >50% of cases.

(Choice A) Turner syndrome (45,XO) presents with low-set ears, a webbed neck, wide-
spaced nipples, and cardiac defects (eg, aortic coarctation). Most cases are due to absence
of the paternally contributed X chromosome.

(Choice B) DiGeorge syndrome, caused by sporadic 22q11 deletions, presents with
hypertelorism, micrognathia, cleft palate, and cardiac defects (eg, interrupted aortic arch,
Tetralogy of Fallot).

(Choice C) The Philadelphia chromosome is a balanced translocation between chromosomes
9 and 22 that produces an oncogenic fusion gene (BCR-ABL) associated with chronic
myelogenous leukemia.

(Choice E) Trisomy 18 (47, XX, +18), or Edwards syndrome, usually arises secondary to
meiotic nondisjunction with maternal age >35. Findings include dysmorphic facies (eg,
micrognathia, low-set ears), clenched hands with overlapping fingers, and hypertonia.
