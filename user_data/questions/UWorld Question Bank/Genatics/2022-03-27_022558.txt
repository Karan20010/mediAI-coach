14 The most common type of hair loss in males and females is androgenetic alopecia (male
pattern baldness). As the name implies, the hair loss is driven by both hormonal (eg,

17 circulating androgens) and genetic factors. The hair loss occurs primarily at the temporal

. areas and vertex and progresses through life. The pattern and severity vary between males
+ 20 and females.
» 21
+ 2 Androgenetic alopecia demonstrates polygenic inheritance with variable expressivity. Key

sites of genetic influence have been identified on the short arm of chromosome 20, and also

25 on the X and possibly Y chromosomes. Therefore, some of the genetic factors may be

. transmitted with X-linked recessive inheritance (eg, gene variations in the androgen receptor),
+ 28 whereas others will show autosomal dominant inheritance (Choice A).
» 29
. 30 (Choice B) Autosomal recessive inheritance classically shows disease development in 25%

of offspring from 2 asymptomatic carrier parents. In most cases, conditions with autosomal

33 recessive inheritance will not be seen in consecutive generations.
34
35 (Choice C) Conditions passed through mitochondrial inheritance are transmitted only by the
* 38 mother, and all of her offspring are affected. Conditions transmitted by mitochondrial
+ 37
. 38 inheritance include a number of uncommon neuromuscular disorders. ee
