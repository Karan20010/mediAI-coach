This patient has hemophilia A, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by easy bruising
and excessive bleeding due to a deficiency in coagulation factor VIII. The disorder can be
caused by a variety of different mutations in the factor VIII gene, including deletions in the
enhancer sequence.

In eukaryotic gene transcription, nuclear RNA polymerase II uses a DNA template to generate
complementary mRNA, which is then processed and translated into protein. Eukaryotic genes
have associated promoter and enhancer sequences that mediate transcription. Promoter
sequences directly bind general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II upstream from
the gene locus, which is necessary for the initiation of transcription (Choices C and E). There
are 2 types of eukaryotic promoter regions: the TATA, or Hogness, box, which is located
approximately 25 bases upstream from the gene being transcribed; and the CAAT box, which
is 70-80 bases upstream from the gene.

In contrast to promoters, enhancer sequences bind activator proteins that facilitate bending of
DNA. DNA bending allows activator proteins to interact with general transcription factors and
RNA polymerase II at the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription (Choice D).
Enhancers can be located upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed and
may be near the gene or thousands of base pairs away (Choice B). They have also been
