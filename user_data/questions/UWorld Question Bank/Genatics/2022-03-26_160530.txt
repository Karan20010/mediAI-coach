(Choice D) Locus heterogeneity refers to the ability of one disease or trait to be caused by
mutations in multiple different genes. An example is familial hypercholesteremia, which can be
caused by different mutations affecting cholesterol metabolism genes (eg, LDL receptor, apo
B-100).
(Choice F) Polyploidy occurs when more than 2 complete sets of homologous chromosomes
exist within an organism or cell. In a partial hydatidiform mole, for example, there are cells of
nonstandard ploidy (typically 69,XXX; 69,XXY; or 69,XYY). The chromosomes in this case are
derived from 1 haploid maternal set and 2 haploid paternal sets of chromosomes.

(Choice G) The law of segregation (Mendel's first law) describes the phenomenon whereby
gametogenesis within the parent organism results in the separation of paired alleles so that
each offspring inherits only half of each parent's genetic composition.

Educational objective:

Pleiotropy describes instances where multiple phenotypic manifestations result from a single
genetic mutation. Most syndromic genetic illnesses exhibit pleiotropy.
