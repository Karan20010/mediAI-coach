During normal meiosis, homologous chromosomes separate to pass on individual chromatids
to daughter cells. In meiotic nondisjunction, the chromosomes fail to separate, allowing one
or more daughter cells to pass on with an extra copy of a chromosome. Increasing maternal
age, particularly age >35, is associated with an elevated risk of nondisjunction that is likely due
to cumulative oxidative stress, depletion of available mature oocytes, and shortening of oocyte
telomeres. From highest to lowest prevalence, the most common consequences of maternal
nondisjunction are trisomies 21 (Down syndrome), 18 (Edwards syndrome), and 13 (Patau
syndrome).

Less than 5% of Down syndrome cases are caused by a Robertsonian translocation (Choice
B), which results from a break near the centromeres of 2 chromosomes (eg, chromosomes 14
and 21) and subsequent transfer of genetic material between these chromosomes. This
translocation results in 46 chromosomes in the fetus with 3 effective copies of chromosome
21.

Classic features of Down syndrome include a flat facial profile, epicanthal folds, upslanting
palpebral fissures, protruding tongue, and small ears. Congenital heart defects (eg, complete
atrioventricular defect, ventricular or atrial septal defect) are seen in 50% of patients.

(Choice A) Chromosomal deletions are associated with cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion),
