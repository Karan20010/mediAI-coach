(Choice A) Chromosomal deletions can be either macro or micro, depending on how many
base pairs are eliminated. Neither process results in the elimination of entire chromosomes or
the presence of multiple cell lines within the body.

(Choice B) Complete monosomy X also causes Turner syndrome. However, it would not
explain the 2 separate genotypes seen on karyotyping.

(Choice C) This patient has manifestations of Turner syndrome and peripheral cells with
multiple distinct genotypes, which indicates that she has somatic mosaicism. If the mitotic
error occurred very early in embryogenesis, before separation of the germline, she could also
have germline mosaicism. However, germline mosaicism would not be the cause of her
clinical manifestations and would not be detectable on karyotyping of a blood sample.

(Choice E) Uniparental disomy describes the phenomenon wherein both chromosomes in a
given pair come from one parent. In such cases, patients still have the full complement of
chromosomes on karyotyping.

(Choice F) In women, one X chromosome is normally inactivated in each somatic cell to

maintain proper gene dosage. Despite the presence of only one functional X chromosome in
each cell, both are still detectable on karyotyping.
