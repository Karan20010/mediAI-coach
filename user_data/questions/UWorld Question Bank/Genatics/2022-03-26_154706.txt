(Choices A and C) Changing CUU (leucine) to AUU (isoleucine) or UAC (tyrosine) to CAC
(histidine) would result in an amino acid substitution at one position (missense mutation). The

function of this protein may be altered depending on a variety of factors, but the ultimate size
of the protein will remain the same. Missense mutations that result in the substitution of a new
amino acid with similar chemical properties are called conservative mutations.

(Choice B) Changing UAA to UAG would not affect protein structure or function because both
of these sequences are stop codons. Stop codons are normally located at the end of the
translated region of MRNA.

(Choice E) Changing UUU to UUC would not affect the protein as both sequences code for
phenylalanine. Point mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of a protein are
called silent mutations.

Educational objective:

Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness in young
boys due to increased muscle fiber degeneration. It is caused by frameshift mutations (most
common) or nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene that lead to the formation of a

truncated, defective protein. Nonsense mutations introduce premature stop codons (eg, UAA,
UAG, UGA) in the coding sequence of mRNA. Activate V
