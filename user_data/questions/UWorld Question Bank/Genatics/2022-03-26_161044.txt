3 This child has many of the characteristic features of Down syndrome (DS), a condition that
: results from an increased gene dosage effect due to an extra copy of chromosome 21.
16 Three cytogenetic abnormalities can lead to DS:

1s ¢ Meiotic nondisjunction accounts for nearly 95% of DS cases. Failure of homologous

chromosomes or sister chromatids to separate during meiosis can result in the inheritance
21 of 3 copies of chromosome 21 in one daughter cell (trisomy) and 1 copy in the other
daughter cell (monosomy). Nondisjunction during meiosis is almost always of maternal

+ 24 origin.

Unbalanced translocations account for 2%-3% of DS cases. These individuals have 46

chromosomes, but have extra genetic material (consisting of duplicate chromosome 21
29 genes) attached to one of their chromosomes. Approximately one third of these cases are
due to a balanced translocation in one parent, which confers a high recurrence risk.

Mosaicism accounts for <2% of DS cases. Affected individuals have 2 distinct cell lines

+ 34 as a result of nondisjunction during mitosis: one with a normal genotype and one with
trisomy 21. The proportion of affected cells determines the severity of DS features.

Of the available answer options, only mosaicism is consistent with a third copy of ctivate V
