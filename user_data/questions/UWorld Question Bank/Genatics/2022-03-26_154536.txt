A cell biologist is studying the role of ribonucleoproteins in normal cellular function. He
prepares a cell extract using a specific cell type obtained from a 73-year-old man.
Ribonucleoproteins are separated and purified from the cell extract for structural and functional

analyses. These cells are found to express higher amounts of a particular protein in
comparison to other cell types. This protein has reverse transcriptase activity that functions to
add TTAGGG repeats to the 3' end of chromosomes. Which of the following cell types was
most likely studied in this experiment?

©) A. Epidermal basal cells
© B. Erythrocytes

(©) C. Myocardial cells

©, D. Neurons

©) E. Pancreatic B cells
