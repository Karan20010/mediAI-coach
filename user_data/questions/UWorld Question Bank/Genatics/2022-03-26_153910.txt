A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician for fatigue and persistent bone pain. Physical
examination shows diffuse lymphadenopathy and multiple purpura over his arms and legs.
Laboratory analysis reveals anemia and thrombocytopenia, and a peripheral blood smear
shows lymphoblasts. After further workup, he is diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia
and started on a chemotherapy regimen that includes doxorubicin. This agent intercalates
between DNA base pairs and inhibits DNA replication, a process that normally occurs at sites
known as replication forks. As the replication forks move across the DNA molecule, 2 distinct
daughter strands are formed. Which of the following is unique to the daughter strand that is
synthesized in the opposite direction of the growing replication fork?

JY A. Synthesis of multiple, short DNA fragments (75%)
B. 5'>3' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase (6%)
C. 3'=5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase (8%)
D. 3'—5' polymerase activity of DNA polymerase (3%)

E. RNA primer synthesis before DNA strand synthesis (5%)
