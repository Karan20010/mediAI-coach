This patient has B thalassemia due to a mutation in the 8 globin gene just before
the methionine start codon (AUG) that is most likely disrupting translation initiation.
Eukaryotic translation initiation requires the assembly of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S),
mRNA, initiation factors, initiator tRNA charged with methionine, and guanosine-5'-
triphosphate (GTP).

The small ribosomal subunit (40S) initially binds to the 5' cap of mRNA and scans for the start
codon, which is positioned near the beginning of the mRNA and is surrounded by the Kozak
consensus sequence. This short sequence identifies the specific AUG codon that serves as
the initiator of translation (analogous to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence in bacteria).

Mutations affecting the Kozak consensus sequence can significantly impair protein
translation and have been identified in patients with a and B thalassemias.

(Choice A) Co-translational protein targeting is mediated by the N-terminal amino acid
sequence of an elongating polypeptide. This localization signal is recognized by a signal
recognition protein that helps transport the ribosome to the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
Mutations affecting the signal sequence would be found after the start codon (AUG).
