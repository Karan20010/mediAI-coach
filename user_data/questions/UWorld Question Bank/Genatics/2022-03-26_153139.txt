DNA polymerases are the primary enzymes responsible for DNA synthesis, which occurs in
the 5' to 3' direction. Prokaryotes such as Escherichia coli have 3 major DNA polymerases: |,
Il, and Ill. DNA replication requires a high degree of fidelity to preserve the genetic code in
daughter cells and prevent potentially lethal mutations. This high-fidelity replication is
accomplished by the 3' to 5' "proofreading" exonuclease activity of all 3 DNA polymerases.

DNA polymerase | is unique as it is the only prokaryotic polymerase that also has 5" to 3’
exonuclease activity. This activity functions to remove the RNA primer created by RNA
primase and repair damaged DNA sequences.

(Choice B) DNA polymerase III has 5' to 3' polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease activity;
however, it does not possess 5' to 3' exonuclease activity.

(Choice C) The enzyme topoisomerase II, also known as DNA gyrase in prokaryotes, relieves
tension created during DNA strand unwinding by introducing negative supercoils into the
circular DNA. Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) are a class of antibiotics that work by
inhibiting DNA gyrase.

(Choice D) Before DNA replication begins, helicase unwinds the DNA double helix, facilitating
separation of the 2 DNA strands by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins.
