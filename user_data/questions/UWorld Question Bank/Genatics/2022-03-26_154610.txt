can be classified as either embryonic or adult stem cells. Although embryonic stem cells are
present in the very early stages of embryogenesis and can give rise to every cell type in adult
humans (pluripotent), adult stem cells are present in most tissues and are generally
responsible for replacing dead cells. For example, the epidermis is continuously replaced by
stem cells present in the basal cell layers. Bone marrow stem cells similarly replace peripheral

red and white blood cells.
(Choice B) Erythrocytes have no nuclei and therefore have no potential to divide.

Educational objective:

Critical shortening in telomere length can signal for programmed cell death. Telomerase is a
reverse transcriptase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase) that lengthens telomeres by adding
TTAGGG repeats to the 3' end of chromosomes. Stem cells have long telomeres due to high
telomerase activity, allowing them to proliferate indefinitely in a controlled manner.
