(Choice B) Northern blots analyze mRNA. A sample containing a large number of MRNA
molecules is separated via gel electrophoresis. Separated bands are then transferred to a
membrane and hybridized with a probe containing a nucleotide sequence complementary to
the mRNA of interest.

(Choice C) Southern blotting is used to analyze DNA sequences. DNA that is fragmented
using restriction endonucleases is separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to a
nitrocellulose membrane. A radiolabeled DNA probe containing a sequence complementary to
an area of interest is then used for hybridization. Restriction site mutations can be detected by
Southern blotting because they alter DNA fragment lengths, thereby altering electrophoresis
migration patterns.

Microarray analysis is similar to Southern and Northern blotting but involves hybridization of a
large number of probes at once (Choice A). The genomic DNA or cDNA being analyzed is
labeled with a fluorescent tag and placed on a gene chip containing complementary
sequences for a large number of genes. The degree of fluorescence corresponds to the
mRNA expressed in the particular sample.

(Choice D) Southwestern blotting is a technique that analyzes DNA-binding proteins using
principles of the Southern and Western blot techniques. DNA-binding proteins are recognized
