(Choice A) Because complementary sequences align in antiparallel fashion, during
translation the tRNA anticodons will bind the 5' to 3' mRNA in the (opposite) 3' to 5' direction.
Therefore, the 5'-UUG-3' mRNA codon will bind the 5'-CAA-3' tRNA anticodon, not the 5'-
AAC-3' anticodon.

(Choices B and E) The 5'-AUC-3' and 5'-UCG-3' anticodons will bind to the 5'-GAU-3' and 5'-
CGA-3' codons, respectively (5' to 3' binds 3' to 5'). These are not present in the above mRNA
sequence.

(Choice D) The last codon shown in the above mRNA sequence is 5'-UAG-3' (a stop codon),
with the second-to-last codon being 5'-AGC-3'. Therefore, 5'-GCU-3' would be the tRNA
anticodon responsible for adding the last amino acid to the normal (non-truncated) protein.

Educational objective:

Translation of the mRNA template proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction. Because complementary
sequences align in antiparallel fashion, during translation tRNA anticodons will be oriented in
the opposite 3' to 5' direction. Stop codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) halt protein synthesis by
binding a release factor; they do not add amino acids to the polypeptide chain.
