A 5-year-old boy is being evaluated for progressive muscle weakness that has resulted in
numerous recent falls. There is no family history of muscle disorders. Physical examination
reveals bilateral calf enlargement. When the patient is asked to stand, he uses his hands and
arms to help push himself to an upright position. Serum creatine kinase is 12,600 U/L (normal:
30-170 U/L). Molecular tests reveal a large muscle protein that is defective due to the loss of
508 amino acid residues. Genetic analysis reveals a single base substitution within exon 48 of
the gene encoding this muscle protein. This patient's gene mutation has most likely resulted in
which of the following mRNA codon changes?
