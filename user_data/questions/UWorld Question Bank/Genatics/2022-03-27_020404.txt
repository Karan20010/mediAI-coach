e The anticodon loop contains sequences that are complementary to the mRNA codon.
During translation, the ribosome complex selects the proper tRNA based solely on its
anticodon sequence.

¢ The T loop contains the TYC sequence that is necessary for binding of tRNA to
ribosomes. The TVC sequence refers to the presence of ribothymidine, pseudouridine,
and cytidine residues.

(Choices A and F) AUG and UAG are mRNA start and stop codons that initiate and terminate
translation, respectively.

(Choices C and D) After transcription, eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes posttranscriptional
modification, which includes the addition of a poly-A tail at the 3' end and methylguanosine cap
at the 5' end, and the removal of introns.

(Choice E) A TATA box is an upstream promoter region associated with some genes in
eukaryotic organisms. TATA binding protein binds to this promoter during transcription,
unwinding the DNA and initiating separation of the strands.

Educational objective:
Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a small, noncoding form of RNA that contains chemically modified
bases (eg, dihydrouridine, ribothymidine, pseudouridine). tRNA has a CCA sequence at its 3'-
