transcription. Hypermethylation of the promotor region of a gene results in transcriptional
silencing; hypomethylation improves gene expression.

(Choice C) The manifestations of Huntington disease are caused by a deleterious gain of
function mutation. Although the normal function of huntingtin is not completely understood, it is
known to play a critical role in embryonic development; loss of huntingtin results in embryonic
death.

(Choice D) Homeodomain (homeobox) genes are critical for the sequential development of
organs and tissues along the body axis during embryogenesis. Mutations affecting these
genes cause alterations in body structure, leading to congenital malformations or spontaneous
abortion.

(Choice E) Thymidine dimerization is a mechanism of DNA damage induced by ultraviolet
radiation.

Educational objective:

Hypo-acetylated histones bind tightly to DNA and prevent transcription of genes in their
associated regions. Alteration of gene expression in Huntington disease occurs in part due to
deacetylation of histones. This prevents the transcription of certain genes that code for

neurotrophic factors, contributing to neuronal cell death.
