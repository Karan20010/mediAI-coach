The couple's 3-year-old son has sickle cell anemia, an autosomal recessive disorder that
causes red blood cells to assume a sickle shape during times of hypoxic stress, resulting in
painful and potentially life-threatening vasoocclusive crises. The disease can be diagnosed
using hemoglobin electrophoresis, which is able to determine the different types of hemoglobin
in a blood sample based on their electrical charge and the speed by which they move through
the medium. The patient's electrophoresis results show a predominance of hemoglobin S
(HbS), which is diagnostic for sickle cell disease.

In this case, both parents are unaffected and must be heterozygous carriers (Aa) of the
disorder because they have an affected child. This means that each parent has a 50%
chance of passing either a normal allele (A) or a mutant allele (a) to the offspring. The
possible genotypes of the unborn child can be calculated using a Punnett square and are as
follows:

¢ 25% chance of inheriting two normal alleles (AA, child is unaffected)
¢ 50% chance of inheriting one normal and one mutant allele (Aa or aA, child is a carrier)
¢ 25% chance of inheriting two mutant alleles (aa, child is affected)

Only the last 2 options result in the child inheriting a mutant allele, so the probability that the

unborn child is carrying one or more mutant alleles is 75%.
