A pharmaceutical corporation investigating new therapeutic agents for treatment of Burkitt
lymphoma synthesizes a double-stranded RNA molecule that is 21 base pairs in length. The
RNA molecule has a base pair sequence that is complementary to a region of MRNA encoding
c-Myc. Introduction of the RNA molecule into tumor cells results in a significant reduction in
cell growth. Western blot analysis of equivalent numbers of treated and untreated cells is
shown below.
