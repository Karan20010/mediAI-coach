The ovaries described in the vignette are the streak ovaries of Turner syndrome (TS). Patients
with TS have normal ovarian development during fetal life. However, lack of the paternal X
chromosome causes loss of ovarian follicles by age 2, as well as a karyotype of 45, X. At
puberty, patients with TS usually have normal pubic hair but no breasts or menses due to
ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure is characterized by high LH and FSH levels, and
TS is one of the most common causes.

Patients with TS also have several extragonadal abnormalities. Short stature, shield chest
(broad, with widely spaced nipples), and webbed neck (broad neck with low hairline) comprise
the appearance of these patients. Lymphedema may be seen at any age, including neonates.
Bicuspid aortic valve (20%-30%) is the most common cardiovascular anomaly; other
common defects include coarctation of the aorta (3%-10%) and aortic root dilation with an
increased risk of aortic dissection in adulthood.

(Choice B) Pancreatic insufficiency occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis due to obstructed,
inspissated pancreatic ducts.

(Choices C and D) Mitral valve prolapse and lens displacement are seen in patients with
Marfan syndrome. These patients are also at risk for aortic root dilation and aortic dissection. aiveteV
