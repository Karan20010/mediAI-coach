Question Id: 2087
Patients with B thalassemia have decreased B globin chain synthesis, which causes
hypochromic, microcytic anemia (mean corpuscular volume <80 m:). Reduced B globin
synthesis also results in the precipitation of unpaired a chains within red cells, causing
membrane damage. This subsequently leads to the death of red cell precursors in the bone
marrow (ineffective erythropoiesis) and lysis of circulating erythrocytes (hemolysis).

Normal erythrocytes have an area of central pallor that typically measures 1/3 of the cell
diameter. Patients with B thalassemia classically have blood smears showing small red cells
with an increased area of central pallor, as seen in the image above. Other common findings
include anisopoikilocytosis (variation in size and shape), target cells, nucleated red cell
precursors, and basophilic stippling.

(Choices A and E) Hyperchromia is characterized by reduced central pallor due to increased
hemoglobin concentration and is usually associated with spherocytosis. Hereditary
spherocytosis is caused by a variety of molecular defects in the genes that encode certain red
cell membrane proteins (eg, spectrin, ankyrin, band 3, protein 4.2).

(Choice B) Iron deficiency often leads to hypochromic, microcytic anemia and is commonly
caused by chronic, asymptomatic bleeding (eg, slow gastrointestinal bleed, abnormal

menstruation). In contrast, patients with thalassemia often have iron overload, not iron
