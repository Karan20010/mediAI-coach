(Choice B) Exposure to ionizing radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) causes double-strand
DNA breaks. The fractured ends can be joined by nonhomologous end joining.

(Choice D) Incorrect base substitution occurs during normal DNA replication and can result in
mutations if they are not corrected. DNA mismatch repair in certain prokaryotes is guided by
hypermethylation of the parent strand, which helps to identify the non-mutated strand for use

as a template.

(Choice E) Deamination of DNA bases (eg, cytosine conversion to uracil, adenine to
hypoxanthine) can occur spontaneously or secondary to chemical exposure. These errors are
corrected by base excision repair. In this process, abnormal bases are recognized and
removed by specific glycosylases without disruption of the phosphodiester backbone. The
apurinic and apyrimidinic residues are then removed by specific endonucleases and replaced
with the correct base by DNA polymerase.

Educational objective:

Pyrimidine dimers are formed in DNA as a result of ultraviolet light exposure. They are

recognized by a specific endonuclease complex that initiates the process of repair by nicking

the damaged strand on both sides of the pyrimidine dimer. The damaged segment is then

excised, and replacement DNA is synthesized by DNA polymerase. ctivate V
