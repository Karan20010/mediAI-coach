Chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion involves deletion of genes residing in adjacent loci. This
results in variable phenotypes including DiGeorge syndrome (cardiac anomalies,
hypoplastic/absent thymus, hypocalcemia) and velocardiofacial syndrome (cleft palate,
cardiac anomalies, dysmorphic facies); the latter is exemplified in this patient.

Defective neural crest migration into derivatives of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches
results in maldevelopment of the thymus and parathyroid as well as subsequent T-cell
deficiency and hypocalcemia. Cardiac defects include interrupted aortic arch and tetralogy of
Fallot (described in this patient). Dysmorphic facial features include orbital hypertelorism,
short palpebral fissures and short philtrum, cleft palate, and bifid uvula. In fluorescence in
situ hybridization (the gold standard test), genes of interest are hybridized with fluorescently
labeled DNA probe. Lack of fluorescent signal is indicative of a microdeletion.

(Choice A) Kartagener syndrome results from immotile cilia due to an autosomal recessive
microtubular defect in the dynein arm. It results in infertility, situs inversus, chronic sinusitis,
and bronchiectasis.

(Choice C) Marfan syndrome, a fibrillin defect, causes cystic medial necrosis of the aorta and
joint hyperextensibility. It is not associated with a cleft palate, but rather with a high-arched

palate with crowded teeth and a narrow face.
