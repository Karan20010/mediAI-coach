2 The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
= molecules that are expressed on the cell surface and are key to recognition of cells as self or
6 non-self by the immune system. These include major class | genes (eg, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-
: C) and class II genes (eg, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR), along with other minor HLA genes.
i Although there are thousands of HLA alleles in the human population with millions of potential
* 20 combinations, the HLA genes are clustered within a short region of a single chromosome.
: = This results in a low rate of crossover, allowing the HLA gene cluster to be treated as an HLA
2 haplotype (a series of linked genes on the same chromosome). Each child inherits 2 HLA
* haplotypes, one from the mother and one from the father. Therefore, the probabilities that a
. . given sibling will share some or all of the same HLA genes are as follows:
7 28 ¢ 1/4 chance of inheriting all the same HLA genes (ie, identical HLA match).
: = ¢ 1/2 chance of inheriting half of the same HLA genes (ie, haploidentical HLA match)
ot (Choice E).
2 ¢ 1/4 chance of inheriting none of the same HLA genes (ie, HLA mismatch).
= Molecular typing of HLA antigens is performed prior to transplants (eg, allogeneic stem cell
035 transplant) to evaluate potential donors for mismatch in HLA alleles (eg, HLA-DR8 versus
: = HLA-DR3), which is associated with higher rates of posttransplant complications (eg, graft
