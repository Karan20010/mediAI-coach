not expressed on the cell surface, which allows the cells to evade apoptosis.

(Choice B) Polyadenylation is a post-transcriptional modification in which a tail comprised of
multiple adenosine nucleotides is added to the 3' end of anew mRNA transcript. This process
is necessary for the nuclear export and cytoplasmic stability of MRNA.

(Choice C) DNAmethylation describes the process by which methyl groups are added to
DNA, suppressing transcription of the methylated genes.

(Choice D) Polycistronic mRNA is often found in bacteria and contains multiple open reading
frames that are translated into several proteins. In contrast, eukaryotic organisms have
monocistronic mRNA, which codes for only one protein.

(Choice E) Ubiquitination is a process by which certain proteins are tagged with ubiquitin, a
small regulatory protein, marking them for proteasomal degradation.

Educational objective:

Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can code for various unique proteins

by selectively including or excluding different DNA coding regions (exons) into mature MRNA.
