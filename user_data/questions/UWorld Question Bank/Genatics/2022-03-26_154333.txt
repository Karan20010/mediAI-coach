(Choice A) Eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA polymerases synthesize daughter strand DNA in
the 5' to 3' direction. The leading strand is formed continuously, whereas the lagging strand is
formed discontinuously, creating Okazaki fragments.

(Choice B) DNA unwinding is an energy-dependent process performed by the enzyme
helicase in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

(Choice D) Proofreading of daughter strands during DNA replication is necessary to preserve
the genetic code and prevent potentially lethal mutations. All 3 prokaryotic DNA polymerases
and most eukaryotic DNA polymerases (eg, y, 5, €) possess 3' to 5' exonuclease
("proofreading") activity.

(Choice E) Prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases require an RNA primer before they
can initiate synthesis of complementary DNA on a single-stranded template. Primase
(prokaryotes) and DNA polymerase a (eukaryotes) are the enzymes responsible for
synthesizing this primer.

Educational objective:

Multiple origins of replication make eukaryotic DNA replication quick and effective despite the
large size and complexity of the genome compared to that of prokaryotic organisms.
