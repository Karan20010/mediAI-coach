(Choice B) DNA (gene) rearrangement occurs during the development and maturation of B
cells and T cells. VDJ (Variable, Diverse, and Joining) gene recombination is a random
process that takes place in the primary lymphoid tissue (the bone marrow for B cells, and
Thymus for T cells).

(Choice C) A mutation is a change in the DNA sequence of a gene. While somatic mutations
do sporadically occur throughout the body, they do so only in a minority of cells. The vast
majority of DNA throughout the body’s tissues consists of identical gene coding sequences.

(Choice D & E) Transcription factors influence RNA polymerase’s affinity for specific genes by
binding to DNA promoter sequences or enhancer regions, which can either stimulate or inhibit
gene transcription. Transcription factors and enhancer regions affect the expression of pre-
mRNA, but they do not influence post-transcriptional processing.

Educational objective:

Alternative splicing is a process where the exons of a gene are reconnected in multiple ways
during post-transcriptional processing. This creates different mRNA sequences and
subsequently, different protein isoforms. It is a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes that greatly
increases the biodiversity of proteins encoded by the genome.
