Mitochondria have a small amount of their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA),
which can have deletions and point mutations just like regular DNA. Mitochondrial disorders
(mutations in mtDNA) are unique in that they are exclusively inherited from one's mother.
Recall that the ovum is relatively large and has many copies of mtDNA; whereas, the few
copies of mtDNA present in sperm are lost during fertilization.

Mitochondrial diseases affect both male and female offspring with equal frequency (100%), but
there are variable degrees of severity. This variability occurs because, during mitosis,
mitochondria are randomly distributed between daughter cells. As a result, some cells contain
mitochondria with mostly damaged mtDNA, while some contain mostly normal mitochondrial
genomes. This mixture of two types of genetic material is called heteroplasmy and is
responsible for the clinical variability of mitochondrial diseases. The following mitochondrial

syndromes are important:

1. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy leads to bilateral vision loss.
2. Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged-red fibers: myoclonic seizures and myopathy associated
with exercise. Skeletal muscle biopsy shows irregularly shaped muscle fibers (ragged red
fibers).
3. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Activate \
