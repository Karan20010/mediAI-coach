(Choice B) It is not necessary to perform maternal hemoglobin electrophoresis as it has been
established from this patient's history that she has sickle cell trait.

(Choice C) Northern blots use electrophoresis to separate RNA by size, followed by the
application of a DNA probe to detect a specific RNA molecule. This allows for the
quantification of the RNA expression of specific genes. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a more
appropriate test for SCD as it involves the separation of protein (eg, hemoglobin) rather than
RNA.

(Choice E) A karyotype is a visual analysis of all the chromosomes in a cell ordered by size
and stained to reveal chromosomal banding. SCD results from a single nucleotide mutation,
not from any abnormality in overall chromosome structure. Disorders due to chromosomal

abnormalities include Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY), Turner syndrome (45,XO) and trisomy

disorders.

Educational objective:

Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy. In order for a child to have
sickle cell disease, both parents must be carriers. Hemoglobin electrophoresis can be used to
determine the carrier status of a prospective parent who has no history of sickle cell anemia.
