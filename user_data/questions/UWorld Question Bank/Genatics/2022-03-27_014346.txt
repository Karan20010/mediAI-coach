Alternative splicing is a process by which different combinations of DNA coding regions
(exons) are selectively included or excluded from a mature messenger RNA (mRNA)
transcript. This allows the DNA contained in a single gene to code for a functionally diverse
group of proteins.

Splicing is a post-transcriptional modification that removes noncoding DNA regions (introns)
from precursor-mRNA (pre-mRNA). The process is driven by a large protein complex
(spliceosome) comprised of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (SnRNPs). Pre-mRNA splice
sites are bound by the spliceosome, forming a lariat-shaped intermediate containing the
introns. This intermediate is excised and the exons are joined, completing the splicing
process.

Alternative splicing is a normal process that allows production of alternate sets of proteins in
different tissues. It has also been implicated in various human diseases. Cancers in particular
can use alternative splicing to evade innate defense mechanisms. The Fas receptor-Fas
ligand interaction drives programmed cell death via the cytotoxic T-cell mediated extrinsic
pathway. Cancer cells may develop the ability to splice out a particular exon that codes for
the transmembrane domain of the Fas receptor (FasR), converting it to a soluble form that is
not expressed on the cell surface, which allows the cells to evade apoptosis.
