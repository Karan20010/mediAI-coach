Question Id: 1486

A 24-year-old woman comes to the office after discovering a new mole on her right leg. She is
worried that it might be skin cancer as she has used tanning beds several times a year since
age 18. Physical examination shows a 5-mm brown, oval macule on her anterior thigh with a
homogeneous coloration and discrete borders. The lesion appears darker than her other
moles. A biopsy of the lesion shows normal-appearing nevus cells clustered in the epidermis,
and she is diagnosed with a benign acquired melanocytic nevus. During histologic analysis,
her epithelial cells are each found to contain a condensed body composed of heavily
methylated DNA at the periphery of the nucleus. This region of DNA is most likely associated

with which of the following genetic findings?
