This boy with severe photosensitivity, poikiloderma, hyperpigmentation in sun-exposed areas,
and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin has xeroderma pigmentosum, an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by defects in nucleotide excision repair.

DNA can be damaged by ultraviolet rays, leading to formation of thymine dimers between 2
adjacent thymine residues. These thymine dimers are repaired by UV-specific
endonuclease, an enzyme that is frequently deficient in patients with xeroderma
pigmentosum. This enzyme recognizes distortions in the structure of DNA caused by thymine
dimers and subsequently excises stretches of single-stranded DNA that contain these defects.
The gap created following this excision is then filled by DNA polymerase, which uses the
opposite DNA strand as a template. The new strand of DNA is then joined on both ends to the
existing DNA by the enzyme ligase.

(Choice A) 3'—5' exonuclease activity describes the "proofreading" ability of DNA
polymerase. This ability allows for the recognition and repair of mismatched bases during
DNA replication. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer is associated with DNA mismatch

repair gene mutations.

(Choice B) DNAligase is responsible for creating a phosphodiester linkage between the

phosphate group of the 5' end of a DNA fragment and the hydroxyl group of the 3' end. DNA
