Educational objective:

Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a trinucleotide repeat
expansion; successive generations typically have an increased number of repeats, resulting in
earlier and more severe disease (ie, anticipation). In children, cognitive/behavioral issues may
be the initial findings before development of muscle weakness and myotonia.
