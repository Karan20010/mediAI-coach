One codon (AUG) signals initiation of protein synthesis and 3 codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA)
stop protein synthesis. Stop codons function only to terminate translation; they do not add
amino acids to the polypeptide chain.

Transfer RNA molecules (tRNA) transport amino acids to the ribosome and ensure placement
of the proper amino acid. One end of the molecule serves as the amino acid binding site; the
opposite end contains a specific nucleic acid sequence known as the anticodon that is
complementary to one or more MRNA codons (due to base wobbling). The type of amino
acid that is bound to each tRNA molecule is determined by its anticodon sequence; this
ensures that the proper amino acid is added at each MRNA codon during protein synthesis.

Translation of the mRNA template proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction. The mRNA of the
dysfunctional protein in the question stem contains an extra stop codon (UAA) before the
normal stop codon (UAG) at the end of the template. During protein translation, the first stop

codon encountered will bind a release factor, halting protein synthesis. Therefore, the codon

just prior to the first stop codon will be the last codon to add an amino acid. In this case, (5'-
UUG-3’') is the last codon to add an amino acid to the truncated protein, and this amino acid

will be carried by the 5'-CAA-3' anticodon (codon-anticodon binding occurs in opposite
directions [ie, 5" to 3" binds 3° to 5’).
