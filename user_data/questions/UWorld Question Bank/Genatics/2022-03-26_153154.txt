A 3-year-old boy is being evaluated for recurrent respiratory infections. The patient's family
immigrated to the United States 5 months after his birth. Since then, the boy has experienced
multiple episodes of pneumonia and bronchitis, and has developed a persistent cough and
failure to thrive. His older brother has no medical issues. A genetic test is performed and
reveals a mutation in an exon of a gene that codes for a transmembrane chloride channel.
The abnormal mRNA is isolated from cultured epithelial cells, and its complementary DNA is
synthesized. Amplified CDNA samples from both the patient and his healthy sibling are
analyzed using gel electrophoresis and compared to DNA fragments of known size to
determine base pair length. The results are shown below.
