Despite the autosomal dominant inheritance, affected patients may not always have an
identifiable first-degree relative who is similarly affected because not all mutations responsible
for HCM have been identified and many known mutations have variable penetrance.

Educational objective:

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by
mutation in one of several genes encoding the myocardial contractile proteins of the cardiac
sarcomere. Mutations that affect cardiac myosin binding protein C or cardiac beta-myosin
heavy chain are responsible for the majority of identifiable mutations in patients with HCM.
