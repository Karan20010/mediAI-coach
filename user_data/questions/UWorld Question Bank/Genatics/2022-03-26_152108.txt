oice A) Matrix metalloproteinases are proteases that degrade extracellular matrix
proteins. They also modulate cell signaling by cleaving cell surface receptors, releasing
apoptotic ligands, and inactivating chemokines/cytokines. These enzymes generally increase
cell proliferation and allow for tissue invasion and metastasis.

(Choice B) Proto-oncogenes often encode proteins involved in signal transduction in
response to growth factors. Mutations in these genes can result in constitutive signal
activation and increased transcription factor expression, stimulating cellular proliferation.

(Choice D) Cyclin D is a protein that is synthesized during the G1 phase of the cell cycle and
helps promote the G1/S phase transition. Increased expression of cyclin D can result in
unchecked cellular proliferation.

(Choice E) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signal protein that helps create
new blood vessels after injury. Cancer cells can overexpress VEGF to promote angiogenesis
and allow for increased growth and metastasis.

Educational objective:

Telomerase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that synthesizes telomeric DNA

sequences that can replace the lost chromosomal ends of the telomeres. Cancer cells

typically contain increased telomerase activity to allow for continued proliferation. ctivate V
