(Choice A) Chromosomal deletions are associated with cri-du-chat syndrome (5p deletion),
DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 microdeletion), and Prader-Willi syndrome (15q deletion).
Deletions are not associated with increased maternal age.

(Choice C) Imprinting is the selective inactivation of a maternal or paternal allele. When a
selectively expressed allele is abnormal (eg, gene deletion), conditions such as Prader-Willi
syndrome (maternal inactivation/paternal deletion) or Angelman syndrome (paternal
inactivation/maternal deletion) can result.

(Choice E) Trinucleotide repeat expansions within DNA can dysregulate protein production,
causing disorders such as Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, and fragile X syndrome.

Educational objective:

Down syndrome is most commonly caused by maternal meiotic nondisjunction, a process by
which the fetus receives 3 full copies of chromosome 21. Dysmorphic features (eg, flat facial
profile, protruding tongue, small ears, upslanting palpebral fissures) and cardiac defects (eg,
endocardial cushion defects) are characteristic.
