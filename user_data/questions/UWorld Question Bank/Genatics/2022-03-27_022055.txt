This patient's short stature, short and thick neck, broad chest, and shortened fourth
metacarpals are characteristic of Turner syndrome (TS). Bicuspid aortic valve is the most
common congenital cardiac malformation in patients with TS. It is usually an isolated
abnormality; however, it may occur in combination with other anomalies, particularly aortic
coarctation. Anonstenotic bicuspid aortic valve manifests with an aortic ejection sound, which
is an early systolic, high-frequency click heard over the right second interspace. As the
valve calcifies, it may result in progressive valvular dysfunction, manifesting with aortic
stenosis or regurgitation and associated murmurs. Patients with a bicuspid aortic valve are
susceptible to infectious endocarditis due to abnormal leaflet structure and turbulent flow.

(Choices A and F) Complete atrioventricular canal, atrial septal defect (ASD), and ventricular
septal defect (VSD) are the most common cardiac anomalies in Down syndrome. Fixed
splitting of the second heart sound is characteristically heard with an ASD, whereas VSDs
produce a holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border.

(Choice C) Mitral stenosis is seen in rheumatic heart disease. It produces a mid-diastolic,
low-pitched, rumbling murmur that may begin with an opening snap.

(Choice D) A mid-systolic click, often accompanied by a late systolic murmur, is the hallmark
of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is more common in connective tissue disorders such as
