structure. Heat shock proteins assist in the spontaneous refolding of proteins.

(Choice C) Posttranscriptional RNA splicing is facilitated by small nuclear ribonucleoproteins
(snRNPs) that remove introns from heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA) containing GU at the
5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site.

(Choice D) The TATA box only participates in the initiation of transcription. The addition of
nucleotides to the forming RNA molecule (RNA elongation) continues until RNA polymerase II
encounters a termination signal.

(Choice F) In eukaryotes, translation initiation requires both ribosomal subunits (60S and
40S) with their associated rRNA, mRNA, initiation factors, initiator tRNA charged with
methionine, and GTP. The assembled ribosome then recognizes the AUG start codon on
mRNA to begin the process.

Educational objective:

The TATA box is a promoter region that binds transcription factors and RNA polymerase II
during the initiation of transcription. It is located approximately 25 bases upstream from the
beginning of the coding region.
