since had 2 additional episodes of pneumonia, each requiring antibiotics for improvement of
symptoms. His current chest x-ray again reveals bilateral lower lobe infiltrates. Further testing
shows a high chloride content in his sweat. Which of the following abnormalities is most likely

to be seen in this patient?

©) A. Abnormal post-translational processing of a transmembrane protein
