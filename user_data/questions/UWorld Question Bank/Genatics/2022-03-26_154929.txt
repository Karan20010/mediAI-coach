DNA can be damaged by a number of agents, including chemicals, ultraviolet radiation, and
ionizing radiation. Ultraviolet rays damage DNA primarily through formation of abnormal
covalent bonds between adjacent thymine or cytosine residues (pyrimidine dimers). The
presence of pyrimidine dimers interferes with base recognition during transcription and
replication, and DNA mutations can result if the damage is not repaired.

Pyrimidine dimers are removed by nucleotide excision repair. In this process, a specific
endonuclease complex detects abnormalities in the DNA structure caused by the formation of
DNA photoproducts. The endonuclease complex then nicks the damaged strand on both
sides of the pyrimidine dimer, and the defective region is excised. DNA polymerase
synthesizes new DNA in the place of the damaged DNA, and DNA ligase seals the final
remaining nick.

Mutations that impair the components involved in nucleotide excision repair cause xeroderma
pigmentosum, a condition characterized by severe photosensitivity and the development of

skin cancers at a young age.

(Choice A) Ultraviolet radiation causes the formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine dimers, not

purine-purine dimers.

(Choice B) Exposure to ionizing radiation (x-rays and gamma rays) causes double-strand
