Trisomy 21, the cause of Down syndrome (DS), is the most common chromosomal
abnormality and most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Risk factors include
advanced maternal age (235) and a parent with a Robertsonian translocation.

DS can be screened and diagnosed prenatally. One common option for screening during the
second trimester is the quadruple screen at 15-19 weeks gestation. Low maternal serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and unconjugated estriol levels are associated with DS and
correlate with decreased fetal levels (possibly due to suboptimal fetal tissue function). In
addition, increased B-hCG and inhibin A are secreted by the placenta, possibly due to
compensatory placental hyperfunction. The diagnosis is confirmed by karyotyping fetal cells in
the amniotic fluid (amniocentesis).

Most patients with DS have trisomy 21 from meiotic nondisjunction—specifically, failure of
chromosome 21 to divide during meiosis. Chromosome 21 nondisjunction occurs during

oogenesis and is significantly associated with advanced maternal age; it is not seen in

spermatogenesis or in postzygotic mitotic errors. DS can also result from an unbalanced
Robertsonian translocation, during which the entire long arm of one chromosome 21 is
translocated to the long arm of an acrocentric chromosome (ie, chromosome 14). These
individuals have 46 chromosomes; however, one chromosome 14 is comprised of the long
