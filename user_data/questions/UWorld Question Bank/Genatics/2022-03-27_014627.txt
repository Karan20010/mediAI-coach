(Choice B) Genetic heterogeneity describes different genetic mutations causing the same
disease (eg, tuberous sclerosis). This mechanism is inconsistent with this patient's symptoms
because affected members of the same family would have the same mutation. Moreover, this
mother and child have markedly different disease manifestations.

(Choice C) Germline mosaicism occurs when an unaffected parent has gametes with a
mutated allele that is passed to offspring; it is typically suspected when multiple siblings have
an autosomal dominant disorder with phenotypically normal parents.

(Choice D) Prader-Willi syndrome often occurs due to maternal imprinting, in which a loss-of-
function mutation in the paternal allele is inherited while the maternally inherited allele is
silenced. Infants can have profound disease (eg, hypotonia, feeding difficulties), but the
mother would not be affected.

(Choice E) Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) refers to a variation at a single base pair
within a DNA sequence. SNPs occur frequently throughout the genome and contribute to
genetic variation within the population. If located near or within a gene, they may be markers
of certain genetic diseases but would not cause the increasingly severe manifestations seen in
this family's successive generations.
