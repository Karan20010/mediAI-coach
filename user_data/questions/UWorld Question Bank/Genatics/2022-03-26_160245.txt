Question Id: 8283
Two genetic loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when their respective alleles are
inherited together in the same gamete (haplotype) more or less often than expected by
chance alone given their corresponding allele frequencies. Although linkage disequilibrium is
often the result of physical proximity of genes on the same chromosome, it does not always
imply physical linkage between the allelic loci.

To estimate the expected probability of 2 alleles from separate loci appearing together, multiply
their occurrence rates. Note that the Hardy-Weinberg principle (2pq) is not applicable when

considering alleles at different loci.

DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 = [Frequency of DQA1*0501] x
haplotype frequency [Frequency of DQB1*0201]
=0.3 x 0.2
= 0.06

In this example, the observed frequency of both alleles being inherited together is 0.2, which is
greater than the expected frequency of 0.06; therefore, the population is said to be in linkage
disequilibrium. This disequilibrium is explained by the close proximity of the HLA-DQA1 and
HLA-DQB1 loci that code for a and B chains of class II major histocompatibility complex.
