the mother had a failure in meiosis II, the child’s RFLP analysis would reveal

only two bands (see example). There would be a single band from the father and a darker,

rom the mother. The darker, thicker band signifies the inheritance of both sister

chromatids, which will produce equal-size restriction fragments (but twice the normal amount).

the father had a failure in meiosis I, the child’s RFLP analysis would reveal 3

bands (see example). In this instance, there would be a single band inherited from the mother

with two bands inherited from the father.

the father had a failure in meiosis II, the child’s RFLP analysis would reveal two

bands (see example). In this instance, there would be a single band inherited from the mother
and a second band from the father. The father’s band would be darker and thicker, signifying
the inheritance of both sister chromatids.

Educational objective:

Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosome pairs to separate properly during cell division.
This could be due to a failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis | or a failure
of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II or mitosis.
