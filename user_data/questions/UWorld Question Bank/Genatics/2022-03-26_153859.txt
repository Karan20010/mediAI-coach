phosphate group of the 5' end of a DNA fragment and the hydroxyl group of the 3' end. DNA
ligase is particularly active in joining the Okazaki fragments created during discontinuous

replication of the lagging strand.

(Choice D) Helicases are responsible for unwinding and separating double-stranded DNA into
single-stranded DNA in preparation for DNA replication.

(Choice E) Topoisomerase enzymes relieve DNA supercoiling produced during unwinding
and separation by helicase. Prokaryotic topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) is inhibited by
fluoroquinolone antibiotics, whereas eukaryotic topoisomerase II is inhibited by the anticancer

drug etoposide.
