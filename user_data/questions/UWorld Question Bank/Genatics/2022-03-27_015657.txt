A 12-year-old boy is evaluated in the clinic due to excessive bleeding following a tooth
extraction. The patient also develops large bruises after only minor injury but has had no
major bleeding episodes in the past. His maternal uncle died from an intracranial

hemorrhage. Laboratory testing reveals decreased coagulation factor VIII activity levels. A
referral is made to a clinical geneticist, who suspects that the patient has a deletion mutation in
the enhancer sequence of the factor VIII gene. This mutation has resulted in decreased
transcription of factor VIII by RNA polymerase II. Which of the following is the most accurate
statement regarding the abnormal genetic sequence in this patient?

© A. It can be located upstream, downstream, or within introns of the gene
©) B. It can function within only a short distance of the gene

©) C. It directly binds RNA polymerase and general transcription factors

©) D. It does not require protein binding to affect transcription

©) E. Itis required to initiate transcription
