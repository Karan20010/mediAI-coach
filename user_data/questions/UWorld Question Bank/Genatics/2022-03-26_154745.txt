This case is an example of locus heterogeneity, in which mutations at different genetic loci
result in similar phenotypes. Both parents have oculocutaneous albinism, an inherited
autosomal recessive disorder. However, although their phenotype is similar, their recessive
mutations occur on different chromosomes.

In this case, the child would inherit one normal (paternal) allele and one abnormal (maternal)
allele at location 15q12-q13 and one normal (maternal) allele and one abnormal (paternal)
allele at location 11q14.3. Because the child would have one normal, dominant allele at
each location, they would be a double heterozygote and therefore would not express an
oculocutaneous albinism phenotype.

(Choice A) In contrast to this case, allelic heterogeneity describes different mutations at the
same genetic locus causing similar phenotypes (eg, cystic fibrosis). Children born to parents
who have autosomal recessive genetic conditions resulting from different mutations at the
same genetic locus would inherit two abnormal copies of the gene and likely display the
corresponding phenotype.

(Choice B) Mitochondrial diseases (eg, MELAS syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy)
are maternally inherited. The variable severity of these diseases is explained by

heteroplasmy, the random distribution of normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA between
