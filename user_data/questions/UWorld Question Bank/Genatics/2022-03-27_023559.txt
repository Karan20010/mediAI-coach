This patient has a history of recurrent pneumonia, digital clubbing, azoospermia, and bilateral
absence of the vas deferens; this is most likely due to cystic fibrosis (CF). Patients with CF
have variable severity of lung and pancreatic function. Although most patients have recurrent
sinopulmonary infections and pancreatic insufficiency, some patients may have mild disease
depending on their underlying mutation. Regardless of lung or pancreas function, virtually all
adult men with CF have azoospermia and infertility. Although spermatogenesis is usually
normal, almost all males with CF are unable to secrete semen due to congenital bilateral
absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). CFTR mutations are likely responsible for abnormal
development of Wolffian structures, resulting in vasal agenesis and defective sperm transport.

A diagnosis of CF can be based on elevated sweat chloride levels. If the sweat chloride test
is equivocal, measurement of nasal transepithelial potential difference and genetic testing
for CFTR mutations should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

(Choice B) Although, primary ciliary dyskinesia (eg, Kartagener syndrome) can cause
recurrent pulmonary infections and digital clubbing, infertility in Kartagener syndrome is usually
due to immotile spermatozoa. Abnormal nasociliary motility is a nonspecific finding that is
seen most commonly in patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia and in some patients with CF
(due to abnormally thick mucus). A more specific test for CF is the nasal transepithelial
