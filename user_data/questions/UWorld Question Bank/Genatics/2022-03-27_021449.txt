Mosaicism is defined as the presence of multiple, genetically different cell lines within the
body. It can result from several processes, including chromosomal nondisjunction or a
mutation during the first stages of embryonic development. Somatic mosaicism results in a
mixture of normal and mutated somatic cells, often leading to a milder form of the disease.
