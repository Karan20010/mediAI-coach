A 1-day-old infant in the newborn nursery is found to have a harsh, holosystolic murmur on
physical examination. The neonate was born at 39 weeks gestation to a 36-year-old woman
who opted to defer prenatal screening. Review of medical records shows no family history of
genetic or chromosomal disorders. The infant's vital signs are appropriate for his age. The
rest of the physical examination shows a flat facial profile, protruding tongue, and small ears.
