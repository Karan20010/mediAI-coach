(Choice C) Chronic myelogenous leukemia is commonly associated with a reciprocal
translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 (ie, Philadelphia
chromosome). This translocation fuses the BCR gene on chromosome 22 to the ABL gene on
chromosome 9, resulting in formation of the oncogenic BCR-ABL fusion gene. Unlike this
case, karyotype analysis would show elongation of chromosome 9 and shortening of
chromosome 22.

(Choice D) Turner syndrome (45, XO) and Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY) increase the risk of
ovarian germ cell tumors and extragonadal germ cell tumors, respectively. This patient's
karyotype is inconsistent with these diagnoses, and germ cell tumors are not increased in
patients with Down syndrome.

(Choices E and F) Incidence of retinoblastoma, which is associated with a retinoblastoma
(RB1) gene mutation, and rhabdomyosarcoma is not increased in patients with Down
syndrome.

Educational objective:

Trisomy 21 (which is diagnostic for Down syndrome) is detectable by cytogenetic karyotype

analysis. Patients are at increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies, including

acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. Activate Windows
