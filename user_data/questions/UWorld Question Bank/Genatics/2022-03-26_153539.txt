Therapeutic ionizing radiation (eg, gamma rays, x-rays), commonly used to treat or palliate
several types of cancer, can cause cell death through 2 major mechanisms:

¢ DNA double-strand breakage: Breakage of both strands is generally required, as single
strand breaks are readily repaired by polymerases.

¢ Free radical formation: Reactive oxygen species are formed by ionization of water;
oxygen free radicals are then able to cause cellular and DNA damage.

The effect of radiation is most pronounced in malignant cells as they are rapidly dividing and
consequently less able to repair DNA damage. Epithelial surfaces (eg, bowel mucosa, skin)
are also severely affected because they are rapidly dividing.

A characteristic cell death curve of exposure to radiation shows a nearly flat line on initial
exposure, followed by a steep increase in cell death as the radiation dose increases
(Diagram). The steep portion is due to a sharp increase in double-stranded DNA strand
fractures and oxygen free radicals.
