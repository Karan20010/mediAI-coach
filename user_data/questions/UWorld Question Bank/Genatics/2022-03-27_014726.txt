Amino acid activation and attachment to the 3' end of tRNA are catalyzed by aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases (AA-tRNA synthetases). Each amino acid/tRNA pair has a specific AA-tRNA
synthetase that links them together. These enzymes are responsible for ensuring that each
amino acid binds to the tRNA with the proper anticodon. AA-tRNA synthetase activation and
binding sites are highly specific for their correct amino acids and tRNA molecules. In
addition, some AA-tRNA synthetases can "proofread" their specific tRNA molecules and
hydrolyze the amino acid bond when their tRNAs are incorrectly charged. The error rate for
AA-tRNA synthetases is therefore very low, with less than 1 error per 10+ charges.

During protein synthesis, tRNA acts as an adaptor molecule between the codons found on
mRNA and the amino acids being incorporated into the polypeptide chain. The amino acid
sequence in a polypeptide chain is dictated by the binding of a tRNA anticodon to its

complementary codon on the mRNA molecule being translated. Erroneous amino acid/tRNA

coupling by AA-tRNA synthetase causes the wrong amino acid to be incorporated into the
growing polypeptide chain (Choice E).

For example, under normal circumstances, when the ribosome encounters a cysteine codon
(eg, UGU) on mRNA, the complementary tRNA anticodon (eg, ACA) binds. If this tRNA is
improperly charged with alanine, as described in the experiment above, alanine will be
