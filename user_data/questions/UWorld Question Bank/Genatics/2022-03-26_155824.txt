Educational Objective:

Mitochondrial diseases are characterized by exclusively-maternal inheritance. The variable
severity of these diseases is explained by the random distribution of normal and mutated
mitochondria between daughter cells during mitosis; as a result, some cells may have
completely healthy mitochondria, while other cells contain mitochondria affected by genetic

mutation (heteroplasmy). MELAS is a mitochondrial syndrome.
