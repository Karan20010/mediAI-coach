Geneticists are studying a malfunctioning protein that causes impaired endothelial cell
migration and angiogenesis. They have noticed that the amino acid sequence of the protein is
truncated compared to normal controls. The mutated mRNA strand is isolated, and analysis
shows a nonsense mutation located near the 3' end of the coding region. The 3' terminal
coding sequence of the abnormal mRNA strand is shown below.
