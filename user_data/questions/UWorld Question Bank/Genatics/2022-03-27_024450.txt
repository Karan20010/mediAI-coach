Fragile X syndrome, an X-linked disorder, is the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability. The defect is an unstable expansion of trinucleotide repeats (CGG) in the fragile
X mental retardation 1 (FMR7) gene, located on the long arm of the X chromosome. When the
cells of affected individuals are cultured in folate-deficient medium, the area of increased
repeats does not stain and appears "broken," hence the name "fragile X.". Cytogenetic studies
(chromosomal analysis) typically show a small gap near the tip of the long arm of the X

chromosome.

The earliest manifestations of fragile X syndrome involve developmental delay, including
delayed attainment of motor and language milestones. Mild to moderate intellectual disability
is common. Classic physical features in fragile X syndrome include macrocephaly, a long
narrow face, and a prominent forehead, jaw, chin, and ears. Macroorchidism (testicular
enlargement) is also a key finding. All examination findings tend to be subtle during infancy

and become most noticeable after puberty.

(Choice A) Cardinal features of Marfan syndrome are lens dislocation (ectopia lentis) and
aortic root dilation. Other common abnormalities include arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and mitral
valve prolapse. Cognition and chromosomal studies are typically normal in these patients.

(Choice C) Down syndrome is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability.
