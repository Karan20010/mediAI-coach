A study is undertaken to map the HLA-DQ loci in a population with a high incidence of celiac
sprue. High-resolution HLA typing of the DQA1 and DQB1 loci is performed using polymerase
chain reaction sequencing. The frequency of the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype, strongly
implicated in autoimmunity, is found to be 0.2. However, in the same population, the frequency
of the DQA1*0501 allele is 0.3 and the frequency of the DQB1*0201 allele is 0.2. Which of the
following best explains the observed DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype frequency in this
population?

A. Heteroplasmy (11%)

B. Increased penetrance (8%)
SY C. Linkage disequilibrium (60%)

D. Pleiotropy (13%)

E. Segregation (7%)
