Proteins & their function in prokaryotic DNA replication

Helicase

Unwinding of double helix

Topoisomerase Il
(DNA gyrase)

¢ Removal of supercoils

Single-stranded
DNA-binding protein

Stabilization of unwound
template strands

Primase (RNA
polymerase)

Synthesis of RNA primer

5' to 3' DNA synthesis & 3' to 5'

DNA polymerase Ill exonuclease ("proofreading")
activity
¢ Same as DNA polymerase III
e Also removes RNA primer (5' to
DNA polymerase |

3' exonuclease activity) &
replaces it with DNA
