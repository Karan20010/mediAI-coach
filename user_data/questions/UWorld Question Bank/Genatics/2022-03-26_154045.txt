(Choice B) Autosomal recessive conditions affect about 25% of all children (males and
females) with two carrier parents. Offspring of a single affected parent will be carriers for the
disorder. As a result, the disease can skip generations, but consanguineous families will show
increased incidence.

(Choice C) In X-linked dominant disorders, all female children of affected males will have the
condition, but both female and male children of an affected female have a 50% chance of
being affected. There is no father-to-son transmission.

(Choice D) In X-linked recessive conditions, male offspring of a carrier female have a 50%
chance of being affected, whereas female offspring have a 50% chance of being carriers.
Female children of an affected father are obligate carriers. The disease can skip generations,
and there is no father-to-son transmission.

Educational objective:

Mitochondrial dysfunction frequently presents with myopathy, nervous system dysfunction,
lactic acidosis, and ragged red fibers on muscle biopsy. Mitochondrial myopathies due to
mtDNA mutations are inherited solely in a maternal fashion (ie, maternal inheritance).
Therefore, transmission occurs only through affected females and never through males.
