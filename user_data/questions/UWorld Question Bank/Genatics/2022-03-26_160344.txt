The probability that the sister will have an affected son is the probability that all 3 of the above
events will take place (ie, the product of their individual probabilities): p1 x p2 x p3 = 1/2 x 1/2 x
1/2 = 1/8.

Educational objective:
Given phenotypically normal parents, the probability that a female sibling of a male affected by
an X-linked recessive disease will give birth to an affected child is 1/8.
