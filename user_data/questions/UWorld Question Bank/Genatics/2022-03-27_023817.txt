Female gametogenesis begins in utero at approximately 4 weeks gestation when primordial
germ cells migrate from the yolk sac region to the developing gonadal region. These germ
cells then differentiate into oogonia and multiply by mitosis before beginning meiosis |. Now
called primary oocytes, these cells arrest in prophase of meiosis | (Choice C) and remain
there until ovulation. The chromosome pairs are arranged in a tetrad during this phase, and
their proximity allows for genetic recombination. The full complement of oocytes is developed
by 5 months gestation and then degenerates during the woman's lifetime until depleted at

menopause.

At puberty, ovulatory cycles begin and the female is capable of reproduction. During each
menstrual cycle, FSH stimulation followed by an LH surge causes some oocytes to resume
meiosis |. Telophase | (Choice E) is the last phase of meiosis | and yields secondary oocytes
and polar bodies. The secondary oocyte begins meiosis II (the polar body degenerates) but
halts in metaphase II. Approximately 36 hours after LH levels begin to rise, a secondary
oocyte is released from the ovarian follicle. The secondary oocyte remains frozen in
metaphase II until fertilization occurs, at which point it completes its division (telophase II,
Choice F) into a mature oocyte (ovum) and second polar body. A normally fertilized embryo is
then diploid due to genetic contribution from both the ovum and sperm pronuclei.
