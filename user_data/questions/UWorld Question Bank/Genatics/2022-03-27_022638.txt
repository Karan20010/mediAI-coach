2 This patient has trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), in which a complete extra copy of

= division occurs prior to ovulation and fertilization and increases with maternal age >35.
v Dysmorphic features include micrognathia, low-set ears, prominent occiput, and rocker
i bottom feet. Patients have significant hypertonia, including clenched hands with
* 20 overlapping fingers. Anomalies of cardiac (eg, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus
: = arteriosus), genitourinary (eg, horseshoe kidney), and gastrointestinal (eg, Meckel's
2 diverticulum, malrotation) systems are characteristic. Prenatal ultrasound findings include fetal
* growth restriction, as seen in this patient. The majority of those affected die in utero; half of
. . livebirths die by age 2 weeks. Surviving patients have severe intellectual disability.
