¢ Gastrointestinal tract disturbances (eg, dysphagia, constipation)

¢ Nonmuscular involvement such as frontal hair loss, cataracts (lens opacities), insulin
resistance, and daytime somnolence

(Choice B) Mitochondrial myopathies are often maternally inherited and characterized by
muscle weakness (eg, exercise intolerance) and lactic acidosis in more severe cases.
Cataracts may be present, but myotonia does not occur.

(Choice C) Partial chromosome deletion can be seen with inherited causes of intellectual
disability (eg, cri-du-chat syndrome) but would not explain this patient's myotonia or cataracts.

(Choice D) Uniparental disomy is the mode of inheritance for Prader-Willi and Angelman
syndromes, which are associated with cognitive dysfunction and behavioral disturbances but
not myotonia.

(Choice E) X-linked frameshift mutation in dystrophin gene can cause both Duchenne and
Becker muscular dystrophy. These conditions present with muscle weakness, but the proximal
lower extremities are typically affected first and cataracts and myotonia are not seen.

Educational objective:
Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant condition caused by a trinucleotide repeat
