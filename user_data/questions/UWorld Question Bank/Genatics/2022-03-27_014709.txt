In an experiment, erythrocyte precursor cells are incubated in a medium containing
radiolabeled cysteine. These radiolabeled cysteine residues are attached to their appropriate
tRNAs by the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. The bound cysteine residues are then
chemically modified to form alanine. The end product of this reaction is a tRNA molecule that
contains the cysteine anticodon but is mischarged with alanine. Which of the following is most
ikely to occur to this alanine residue during polypeptide synthesis of alpha-hemoglobin?

A. It will be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at a site requiring alanine (5%)
YB. It will be incorporated into the polypeptide chain at a site requiring cysteine (69%)

C. It will be randomly incorporated into the polypeptide chain, halting chain elongation
(5%)
D. It will be rapidly cleaved off tRNA by the enzyme glycosylase (13%)

E. It will never be incorporated into the polypeptide chain and will remain attached to
tRNA (6%)
