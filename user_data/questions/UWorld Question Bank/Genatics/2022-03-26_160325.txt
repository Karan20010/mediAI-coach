= This patient is a boy with excessive bleeding and hemarthroses, suggesting a diagnosis of

5 hemophilia A or B. Both diseases are X-linked recessive coagulation factor deficiencies. The

: probability that his sister will give birth to an affected child can be calculated by multiplying the

8 following probabilities:

9

10 ¢ The probability (p1) that the sister is a carrier = 0.5. The patient's father does not carry
the mutation on his X chromosome because he would be affected by the disease if he did.
13 That means the mother carries the mutation on 1 of her 2 X chromosomes. This gives the
daughter a 50% chance of having inherited the mutated X chromosome and therefore

16 being a carrier.
17
18 ¢ The probability (p2) that the offspring of a female carrier will inherit the X chromosome
= with the hemophilia gene = 0.5. Assuming the daughter is a carrier, the probability of
21 passing on the mutant allele is 50% as only 1 of her 2 X chromosomes is passed to her
22 .
3 offspring.
= * ¢ The probability (p3) that his sister will have a boy = 0.5. If the sister's child is female, the
+ 26 child could be a carrier of the disease but would not be affected by it. If a male child

inherits the mutated X chromosome, he will have the disease.
