common than the AF508 mutation.

(Choice D) Mutations causing premature termination of the transmembrane protein (eg,
nonsense, frameshift) also lead to a complete absence of membrane-bound CFTR as the
truncated protein is typically recognized and degraded. These mutations are more common in
the Ashkenazi Jewish population.

(Choice E) CFTR is an ATP-gated chloride channel activated by cAMP-mediated
phosphorylation. Mutations that reduce the ability of the channel to open can also cause CF.
The AF508 mutation, in addition to preventing proper trafficking to the cell surface, also
reduces the regulatory effects of ATP and cAMP on channel opening.

Educational objective:

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is most commonly due to a 3-base pair deletion in the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene at amino acid position 508 (AF508). This mutation
impairs post-translational processing of CFTR, resulting in shunting of CFTR toward the
proteasome, with complete absence of the protein on the cell surface. Elevated sweat chloride

concentrations are found in most patients with CF.
