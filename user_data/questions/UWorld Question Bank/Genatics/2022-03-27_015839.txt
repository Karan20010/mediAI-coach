Primary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses by age 15 in someone who has
normal growth and secondary sexual characteristics (eg, body hair growth, breast
development) or absence of menses by age 13 in girls without secondary sex characteristics.
Chromosomal abnormalities resulting in ovarian insufficiency are the most common cause of
primary amenorrhea.

This patient's short stature, high arched palate, Tanner | breasts, and widely spaced nipples
are characteristic of Turner syndrome (45,XO). Patients with Turner syndrome have a
variable degree of ovarian dysgenesis. The ovaries usually appear underdeveloped and
atrophic ("streak gonads") due to in utero degeneration of the ovarian follicles with
replacement by fibrotic tissue. Since menstruation and breast development are estrogen-
dependent processes, they do not occur because the ovaries are nonfunctional.

(Choice A) Although patients with Turner syndrome may have streak ovaries, the uterus
should be present. An absent uterus and primary amenorrhea can be seen in Miullerian
agenesis and androgen insensitivity syndrome.

(Choice B) Turner syndrome patients have normal female external genitalia. Ambiguous
external genitalia can be seen in 46,XX patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
