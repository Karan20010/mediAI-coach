(Choices A, B, C, and F) Telomerase is inactivated in long-lived, differentiated cells such as
cardiac myocytes, CNS neurons, compact bone osteocytes, and vascular endothelial cells;
therefore, these cells are not likely to be affected by this patient's mutation. However, in
cancer cells derived from differentiated cells, telomerase is reactivated, allowing continuous
cellular division without loss of telomere length.

(Choice E) Secondary oocytes are immature ova that form as a result of the division of a
primary oocyte during meiosis |. They do not continue to divide and therefore are also not
likely to be affected by this patient's mutation.

Educational objective:

Telomeres help maintain chromosomal integrity and are preserved in rapidly dividing cell lines
(eg, epithelial cells, lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells) by telomerase. Disorders
involving telomerase function (eg, dyskeratosis congenita) result in premature death of cells
with high turnover, characteristically causing mucocutaneous changes (eg, oral leukoplakia,
dystrophic nails), bone marrow failure, and pulmonary fibrosis.
