are short-lived and triggered by startle. Physical examination reveals proximal muscle
weakness. Gomori trichrome stain of a muscle biopsy specimen shows muscle fibers with a
blotchy red appearance. No family history is available because the patient is adopted. What
is the probability that this patient's one offspring will inherit the disease?
