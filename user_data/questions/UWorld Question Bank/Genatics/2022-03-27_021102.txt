The experiment described above is known as the Northern Blot technique, a procedure used
to detect specific mRNA sequences in a sample to assess for gene expression. In this
experiment, the Northern Blot identifies three different mRNA transcripts containing exon 4,
with varying patterns of expression in the different tissues. This is consistent with alternative
splicing, a process whereby the exons of the pre-mRNA produced by transcription of a gene
are reconnected in multiple ways during post-transcriptional processing. The resulting
finalized mRNAs are then translated into different protein isoforms. Thus, a single gene can
code for multiple proteins when the same gene is spliced differently in different tissues.

Alternative splicing is a normal phenomenon in eukaryotes that greatly increases the
biodiversity of proteins that can be encoded by the genome. It is thought that at least 70% of
the 30,000 genes in the human genome undergo alternative splicing, and that on average, a
given gene produces 4 alternatively spliced variants. Thus, the human genome is able to
encode a total of 80,000 to 100,000 proteins which differ in their sequence and function.

Abnormal variations in splicing are implicated in many diseases (e.g., beta-thalassemia,
cancer). Alternative splicing also plays a prominent role in the lifecycle of many retroviruses.
For instance, HIV produces a single primary RNA transcript that is alternatively spliced to
produce over 40 different mRNAs.
