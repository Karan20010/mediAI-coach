Types of DNA mutations

Silent

Base substitu

ion codes for same amino acid

Missense

Base substitu

ion codes for different amino acid

Conservative

Base substitu

ion codes for different amino acid with similar chemical

structure
Nonsense /|Base substitution introduces premature stop codon
Nonstop __|Base substitution within stop codon results in continued translation
Splice site |Mutation at splice site alters intron removal from pre-mRNA
Frameshift |Deletion/insertion of bases causes downstream misreading
