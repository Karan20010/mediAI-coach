(Choice A) DNA polymerase requires a short nucleic acid sequence primer for initiation of
DNA synthesis. During DNA replication, these primers are formed from RNA bases by the
enzyme DNA primase.

(Choice B) DNA transcription is the process in which RNA is transcribed from a DNA template
by an RNA polymerase enzyme. Although certain miRNA sequences can cause transcriptional
inhibition, posttranscriptional silencing is the predominant means of RNA interference.

(Choice D) Degradation of proteins and polypeptides occurs in proteasomes and lysosomes.
Proteasomes mainly degrade nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins; lysosomes degrade cellular
organelles and extracellular proteins.

(Choice E) Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) molecules bind to specific proteins to form small
nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). These snRNPs associate with pre-mRNA to form
spliceosomes, which function to remove introns from pre-mRNA during processing within the
nucleus.

Educational objective:
Short non-coding RNA sequences (eg, microRNA and small interfering RNA) induce
posttranscriptional gene silencing by base-pairing with complementary sequences within target

mRNA molecules. Activate Windows
