(Choice A) Arachnodactyly, scoliosis, and aortic root dilation are signs of Marfan syndrome,
which occurs due to an inherited defect of the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin.

(Choice B) Macroorchidism, large jaw, and intellectual disability are seen in patients with
fragile X syndrome, an X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the fragile X mental

retardation 1 gene.

(Choice C) In females, loss of an X chromosome (45,XO karyotype) results in Turner
syndrome, which presents with short stature, broad chest, and primary amenorrhea.

(Choice D) Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by short stature, hypotonia, intellectual
disability, and obesity. The most common cause is a microdeletion affecting the paternal

chromosome 15q11-13 critical region.

Educational objective:

47,XXY is the most common genotype causing Klinefelter syndrome. Patients present with tall
