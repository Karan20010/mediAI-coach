(either X or Y). Most sex-linked disorders are X-linked recessive (XLR). In XLR disorders,
women with a copy of the defective gene will not have the disorder but will be carriers; men
who inherit the defective gene will be affected. In X-linked dominant disorders, both males and
females are affected following inheritance of the defective gene.

(Choice C) Inheritance of an AD trait does not always result in the disease phenotype in
conditions with incomplete penetrance. However, achondroplasia is a fully penetrant genetic
disorder; if the mother carried the trait, she would have short stature.

(Choice D) About 25% of children are affected in autosomal recessive (AR) disorders if both
parents carry 1 copy of the defective gene (most common scenario). Many AR disorders are
the result of enzymatic deficiencies (eg, phenylketonuria) that require both copies of the gene
to be knocked out, as 1 functional copy usually provides sufficient activity to prevent
occurrence of the disease.

Educational objective:

Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant (AD) disorder that results in a gain-of-function
mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Most individuals affected by AD disorders are heterozygous and
have a 50% chance of transmitting the mutation to their offspring.
