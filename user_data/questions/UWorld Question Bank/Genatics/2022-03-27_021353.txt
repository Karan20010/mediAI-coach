¢ Carrier frequency is equal to the proportion of heterozygous individuals. Carriers have

only 1 mutant allele that may be inherited in 2 different ways (ie, Aa or aA); consequently,
the probability of being a carrier = 2pq. For rare autosomal recessive disorders, p ~ 1;
therefore, the probability approximates to 2 times the frequency of the mutant allele, or 2q.

In this case, 1 in 40,000 individuals is affected by the condition in the general population, so q?

= 1/40,000 and q = 1/V40,000 = 1/200. Thus, the probability of the sperm donor being a

carrier = 2q = 2 x(1/200) = 1/100. Given that a carrier sperm donor would have a 50% chance

of passing on the mutant allele (a), the probability of the child being affected is:

P (mother gives recessive allele) x P (donor is a carrier) x P (donor gives recessive allele) =

(1/2 x 1/100 x1/2) = 1/400

(Choices E and F) 1/40,000 represents the disease frequency (q), not the mutant allele

frequency (q).

Educational objective:

The Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to estimate carrier frequency, disease frequency,

and frequency of different genotypes if at least 1 of these values is known.
