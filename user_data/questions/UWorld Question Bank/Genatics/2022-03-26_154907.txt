An 18-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic due to painful erythema affecting his
extremities, trunk, and face. He is vacationing in Florida and spent 5 hours at a Gulf coast
beach earlier in the day. The patient did not apply any sunscreen as it was cloudy. The
physician explains that cloud cover does not afford a high degree of protection against the sun,
especially with prolonged exposure in highly reflective environments like the beach. He is
advised to wear protective clothing and apply sunscreen to prevent recurrence. Which of the
following is most likely to happen within the patient's skin cells as a result of his exposure?

A. Covalent bond formation between adjacent purine bases (20%)

B. End-joining repair of double-stranded DNA breaks (13%)

Y _ C. Endonuclease nicking of the damaged DNA strand (57%)
D. Hypermethylation of residues in the undamaged DNA strand (3%)
E. Removal of deaminated bases by glycosylase (5%)
