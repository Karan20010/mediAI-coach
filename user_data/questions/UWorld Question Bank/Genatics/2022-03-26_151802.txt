A 43-year-old man is evaluated for progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms. A year ago, he
began feeling depressed and having hallucinations. Five months later, he developed
intermittent paresthesias and progressively worsening choreiform movements, myoclonus, and
ataxia. These symptoms have not improved despite multiple hospitalizations; an extensive
workup has been unrevealing. The patient is a slaughterhouse worker with extensive
exposure to bovine offal. As part of the evaluation for prion disease, a tissue sample digested
with protease is processed via gel electrophoresis and transferred to filter paper. Antibodies to
a specific prion protein are added to the filter. Next, a marked protein that combines with the
antibody-protein complex is used to determine whether the test is positive. Which of the
following best describes this test?

A. Microarray (5%)

B. Northern blot (2%)

C. Southern blot (3%)

D. Southwestern blot (5%)
JY E. Western blot (83%)
