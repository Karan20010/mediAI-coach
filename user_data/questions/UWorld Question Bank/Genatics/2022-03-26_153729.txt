Electron microscopy of a eukaryotic cell during interphase of the cell cycle shows 10-nm thick
chromatin fibers with a "beads on a string" appearance. These chromatin fibers are extracted
and treated with an endonuclease, which preferentially cleaves the "string" portions of the
chromatin. Further evaluation of the "beads" reveals that they are composed of DNA wrapped
around a core of proteins. Which of the following proteins is most likely found outside of this

core and helps promote chromatin compaction?
