night sweats).

(Choice C) BRAF is a protooncogene that produces a protein involved in growth signal
transduction from the cell membrane to the interior of the cell. BRAF mutations are most
strongly associated with malignant melanoma.

(Choice D) c-MYC is a protooncogene overexpressed in Burkitt lymphoma, which usually
presents with a facial mass (eg, endemic African form) or with ascites and multi-organ
involvement (eg, sporadic form). An isolated pancreatic mass with common bile duct
obstruction is far more likely to be pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Educational objective:

Oncogenesis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is almost always due to an early activating
mutation in the KRAS oncogene, which produces a constitutively active protein that allows for
uncontrolled proliferation of tumor cells.
