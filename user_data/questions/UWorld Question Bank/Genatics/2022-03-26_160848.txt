2 DNA replication is coordinated by the actions of multiple enzymes and proteins and requires a
= high degree of fidelity to ensure preservation of the genetic code in daughter cells.
= DNA polymerases are the primary enzymes responsible for DNA synthesis. Prokaryotes such
v as Escherichia coli have 3 major types of DNA polymerase: |, Il, and Ill. All 3 prokaryotic
i DNA polymerases are capable of removing mismatched nucleotides via their 3° to 5"

* 20 exonuclease ("proofreading") activity. Only DNA polymerase | has 5" to 3" exonuclease

: = activity, which is used to remove the RNA primer synthesized by RNA primase (Choice D).

: = (Choice A) In prokaryotes, topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) temporarily cleaves both strands of
2s the DNA double helix and introduces negative supercoils into the circular DNA to relieve
. tension created during strand unwinding.

(Choice B) One of the major methods of DNA damage by ultraviolet (UV) light is the
+ 30 dimerization of adjacent pyrimidine bases to form thymidine dimers. These dimers are
routinely formed after exposure to sunlight but are usually removed via nucleotide excision

33 repair by the enzyme UV-specific endonuclease.

+35 (Choice E) Helicase promotes unwinding and dissociation of parent DNA strands at the

37 replication fork.
