RNA polymerase II at the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription (Choice D).
Enhancers can be located upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed and
may be near the gene or thousands of base pairs away (Choice B). They have also been
identified both within introns of the gene being transcribed as well as on separate
chromosomes. Silencers are similar to enhancers, but they decrease transcription rates by
binding repressor proteins.

Educational objective:

Enhancers and silencers may be located upstream, downstream, or within a transcribed gene;
these gene sequences function to increase and decrease the rate of transcription,
respectively. In contrast, promoter regions are typically located 25 or 75 bases upstream from
their associated genes and function to initiate transcription.
