polymerase. This process stabilizes mRNA and helps it exit the nucleus.
(Choices B and D) In eukaryotes, translation is initiated when the small ribosomal subunit
attaches to the 5' cap of MRNA and then scans for the AUG start codon within the Kozak
consensus sequence. The 5' cap also protects against exonucleases and helps stabilize
mRNA in the cytosol.

(Choice E) Termination of polypeptide synthesis occurs at the 3 stop codons (UAA, UAG,
UGA) in mRNA. Mutations in stop codons (nonstop mutations) can result in continued and
inappropriate translation of mRNA into the 3'-untranslated region, producing an extremely long,
nonfunctional polypeptide.

Educational objective:

Splicing is performed by spliceosomes, which remove introns containing GU at the 5' splice
site and AG at the 3' splice site. Splice site mutations may result in inappropriate removal of
exons and retention of introns, leading to the formation of dysfunctional proteins.
