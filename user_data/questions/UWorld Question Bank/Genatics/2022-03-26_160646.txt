Educational objective:

Many frequently encountered diseases (eg, hypertension, spinal bifida) display multifactorial
inheritance, which involves the complex interaction of numerous genetic and environmental
factors to determine phenotypic expression. Although the exact inheritance risk cannot be
determined, the closer a relative is to the affected person, the more likely the relative is to

develop the trait.
