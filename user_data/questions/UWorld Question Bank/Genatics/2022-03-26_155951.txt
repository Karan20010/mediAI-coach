A study is undertaken to map the HLA-DQ loci in a population with a high incidence of celiac

sprue. High-resolution HLA typing of the DQA1 and DQB1 loci is performed using polymerase
chain reaction sequencing. The frequency of the DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype, strongly
implicated in autoimmunity, is found to be 0.2. However, in the same population, the frequency
of the DQA1*0501 allele is 0.3 and the frequency of the DQB1*0201 allele is 0.2. Which of the

following best explains the observed DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 haplotype frequency in this

population?

() A. Heteroplasmy

©) B. Increased penetrance
©) C. Linkage disequilibrium
©) D. Pleiotropy

(©) E. Segregation
