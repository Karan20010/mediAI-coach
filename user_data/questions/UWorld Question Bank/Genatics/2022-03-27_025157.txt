The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on chromosome 21. The extra copy of

APP present in trisomy 21 is thought to accelerate amyloid accumulation and lead to early-

onset AD.

(Choice A) Amyloid A protein is an acute-phase reactant that is associated with the
development of multisystemic amyloidosis (AA amyloidosis) in reaction to chronic disease
states (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease).

(Choice C) Apolipoprotein E is found in 3 allelic variations: epsilon 2, 3, and 4. Those with 1
or 2 copies of the epsilon 4 allele are at greater risk for late-onset AD (ie, AD diagnosed at age
>65) compared with those without the allele.

(Choice D) Expansion of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the HTT gene, which codes for
huntingtin protein, is responsible for Huntington disease. Individuals with this condition
typically have movement abnormalities (eg, chorea), psychiatric symptoms, and dementia.

(Choice E) Islet amyloid polypeptide is a normal secretory product of pancreatic beta cells

that forms cytotoxic deposits in type 2 diabetes mellitus, impairing beta-cell function.

Educational objective:
Patients with trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) have 3 copies of the amyloid precursor protein
