the differential expression of parental genes. When the chromosome with the deleted region

comes from the father, the lack of expression of maternally imprinted genes results in Prader-

Willi syndrome. Likewise, deletions affecting the maternal chromosome result in Angelman

syndrome due to absent expression of paternally imprinted genes.

(Choice C) HD is transmitted in an autosomal dominant pattern with complete penetrance,
which means that a child who inherits the abnormal gene will inevitably develop Huntington
disease.

(Choice D) Microdeletion is the loss of genetic material too small to be visible via light
microscopy. For example, microdeletion of 22q11 is responsible for DiGeorge syndrome.
(Choice E) The presence of 2 populations of cells with different genotypes in one patient
resulting in the mixed expression of disease is called mosaicism. Examples of mosaicism
include milder forms of Turner (genotype 46XX/45X0), Klinefelter (46XY/47XXY), and Down
syndromes.

(Choice F) Sometimes, one gene mutation leads to multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic
abnormalities, a genetic phenomenon termed pleiotropy.
