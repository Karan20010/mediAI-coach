Only the last 2 options result in the child inheriting a mutant allele, so the probability that the
unborn child is carrying one or more mutant alleles is 75%.

(Choice B) The probability of the unborn child being affected is equivalent to the chance of
inheriting two mutant alleles from the carrier parents, which is 25%. However, this question
asks for the probability that the unborn child will inherit one or more mutant alleles (ie, chance
of having the disease or being a carrier).

Educational objective:

Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disease that results in recurrent episodes of
anemia, jaundice, and painful swelling of the hands and feet. Offspring of carrier parents have
a 25% chance of being affected and a 50% chance of being heterozygous carriers, resulting in
a 75% chance of inheriting at least one mutant allele.
