Molecular typing of HLA antigens is performed prior to transplants (eg, allogeneic stem cell
transplant) to evaluate potential donors for mismatch in HLA alleles (eg, HLA-DR8 versus
HLA-DR3), which is associated with higher rates of posttransplant complications (eg, graft
versus host disease, graft failure). An HLA-identical sibling donor would drastically reduce
the likelihood of serious complications and increase the likelihood of a successful transplant.

Educational objective:

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
molecules that are key to activation of the immune system in response to foreign (non-self)
antigens. All the HLA genes are clustered together, meaning that there is a low rate of
crossover and that offspring essentially inherit 2 HLA haplotypes, one from each parent.
Therefore, the probability that a sibling would be an identical HLA match is 1/4.
