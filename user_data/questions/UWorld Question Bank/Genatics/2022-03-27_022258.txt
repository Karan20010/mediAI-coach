Myotonic dystrophy

Pathogenesis

Autosomal dominant trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion in DMPK

gene*

Untranslatable mutant mRNA disrupts gene expression:

© Disorganized T tubules — weakness & type | myofiber atrophy

© Skeletal muscle chloride channel dysfunction — delayed muscle
relaxation (myotonia)

Clinical
features

Classic (adult) form:

© Progressive muscle weakness (eg, face, hands, ankles)

o Myotonia

© Cardiac abnormalities (eg, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy)

© Cataracts, frontal balding, insulin resistance

Childhood form:

© Cognitive & behavioral problems (classic symptoms develop over
time)

Diagnosis

Genetic testing
