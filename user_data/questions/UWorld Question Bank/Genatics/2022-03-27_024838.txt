Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an
increase in the number of CAG trinucleotide repeats in the gene that codes for the
huntingtin protein. Expansion of the protein's polyglutamine region results in a gain-of-
function that leads to pathological interaction with other proteins, including various

transcription factors.

Transcriptional repression (silencing) is one of the mechanisms by which mutated
huntingtin is thought to cause disease. Regulation of transcription occurs in part due to the
presence of histones, small proteins that complex with DNA to help compact the strands.
Histones can undergo a variety of modifications (eg, methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation)
that affect the accessibility of the genome for transcription. Acetylation of histones weakens
the DNA-histone bond and makes DNA segments more accessible for transcription factors and
RNA polymerases, enhancing gene transcription. In Huntington disease, abnormal huntingtin
causes increased histone deacetylation, silencing the genes necessary for neuronal
survival. As a result, one of the treatment options under investigation includes histone
deacetylase inhibitors that help upregulate survival genes.

(Choice A) DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that acts to inhibit gene
transcription. Hypermethylation of the promotor region of a gene results in transcriptional
