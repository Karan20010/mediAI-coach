familial (inherited) cause. Familial DCM can result from a variety of genetic mutations
affecting either sarcomere (ie, the contractile apparatus) or nonsarcomere proteins.

Truncating mutations (usually nonsense mutations) affecting the TTN gene, which encodes for
the sarcomere protein titin, are the most common cause of familial DCM. Titin is an elastic
protein that anchors the beta-myosin heavy chain to the Z-discs and likely contributes to
passive myocardial tension; absence of complete titin proteins leads to myocardial
