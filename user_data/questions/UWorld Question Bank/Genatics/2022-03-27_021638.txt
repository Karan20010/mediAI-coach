5 A homeobox is a highly conserved DNA sequence that is usually about 180 nucleotides in

: length. A gene containing a homeobox sequence is called a homeobox or hox gene. These

8 genes typically code for transcription factors that bind to regulatory regions on DNA, altering

9

the expression of genes involved in the segmental organization of the embryo. Proper

it morphogenesis ensures that tissues, organs, and structural elements of the body are formed
in the correct position along the cranio-caudal axis. Homeobox gene mutations interrupt this
14 developmental process, often resulting in severe abnormalities such as skeletal malformations
and improperly positioned limbs and appendages.

(Choices A, B, C, D, and F) Homeobox genes do not typically encode cell surface receptors,

19 cytoplasmic enzymes, DNA replication enzymes, structural proteins, or transport proteins.

21 Educational objective:

, Homeobox genes encode DNA-binding transcription factors that play an important role in the
+24 segmental organization of the embryo along the cranio-caudal axis.
