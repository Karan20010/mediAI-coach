The large complexes containing both protein and RNA that are found freely floating and bound
to the endoplasmic reticulum are most likely ribosomes. Ribosome biogenesis occurs
primarily within the nucleolus, a dense round structure inside the nucleus that is in direct
contact with the rest of the nucleoplasm. The nucleolus contains ribosomal DNA coding for the
28S, 5.8S, and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) components, and it is here where most of the
rRNA is transcribed. After synthesis, rRNA is combined with ribosomal protein components
that are translated in the cytoplasm and then imported into the nucleus. The immature 60S
and 40S ribosomal subunits are then exported from the nucleus to fully mature in the
cytoplasm.

(Choice A) The rough endoplasmic reticulum is identifiable due to its characteristic long,
folded membranes that are coated with ribosomes, giving it a speckled or rough appearance.

(Choice C) The nucleus is identifiable as a membrane-bound structure that contains the
nucleolus, electron-lucent euchromatin, and electron-dense heterochromatin (condensed DNA
typically found around the periphery). However, most of the ribosomal DNA is found in the
form of tandem repeats within the nucleolus; only the 5S rRNA is transcribed outside of the
nucleolus.

(Choice D) Mitochondria are organelles with dual phospholipid bilayer membranes that can
