Transfer RNA (tRNA) is a form of non-coding RNA composed of 74-93 nucleotides. Specific
tRNAs transfer certain amino acid residues to the growing polypeptide during translation.
tRNA functions by recognizing the 3 base codon on the MRNA being translated through its
anticodon region, which contains complementary bases. The secondary structure of tRNA
resembles a cloverleaf and contains the following regions:

¢ The acceptor stem is created through the base pairing of the 5'-terminal nucleotides with
the 3'-terminal nucleotides. The CCA tail hangs off the 3' end, with the amino acid bound
to the 3' terminal hydroxyl group. tRNA is "loaded" with the appropriate amino acid by
aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. The acceptor stem helps mediate correct tRNA recognition
by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

A3' CCA tail is added to the 3' end of tRNA as a posttranscriptional modification in
eukaryotes and most prokaryotes. Several enzymes utilize this tail to help recognize tRNA
molecules.

The D loop contains numerous dihydrouridine residues, which are modified bases often
present in tRNA. The D loop (along with the acceptor stem and anticodon loop) facilitates
correct tRNA recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.
