(Choice A) Heteroplasmy describes the presence of different mitochondrial genomes (eg,
mutated and wild type) within a single cell. The severity of mitochondrial diseases is often
related to the proportion of abnormal to normal mitochondria.

(Choice B) Penetrance is the proportion of people with a given genotype who express its
associated phenotype. If all individuals with a given gene express its phenotype, that gene is
a said to have full penetrance.

14 (Choice D) Pleiotropy is the occurrence of multiple phenotypic manifestations, often in
different organ systems, which result from a mutation in a single gene.

(Choice E) The law of segregation describes the phenomenon in which gametogenesis
19 results in the separation of paired chromosomes so that the offspring inherit only half of each
parent's genetic composition.

: Educational objective:

+ 24 Two allele loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when a pair of alleles are inherited

together in the same gamete (haplotype) more often or less often than would be expected

27 given random pairing. This most often occurs when the genes are in close physical proximity

on the same chromosome. AGiVEKE Winelons
