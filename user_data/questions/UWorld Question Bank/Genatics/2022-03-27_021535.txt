5 A hydatidiform mole is a form of gestational trophoblastic disease and can be classified as
: complete or partial. This patient has a complete hydatidiform mole, which most commonly
8 results from the fertilization of an ovum that has no maternal chromosomes by one sperm
= (90% of cases). The chromosomes from the haploid 23X sperm are then duplicated, forming
ut diploid 46,XX tissue that contains only paternal DNA. 46,YY moles from duplication of 23Y
Qe sperm have not been observed, as a zygote without an X chromosome would not survive.
: Less commonly, 2 sperm can fertilize an empty ovum and create 46,XY tissue (Choice B).
16 Patients with a complete mole typically present with pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding. The
= uterus is larger than expected for gestational age, and B-hCG levels are markedly elevated
19 due to trophoblastic hyperplasia. An ultrasound demonstrates a central heterogenous mass
* with multiple cystic areas and is classically described as a "Swiss cheese" or "snowstorm"
7 22 pattern. Acomplete mole has no fetal structures and is composed entirely of large,
: = edematous, and disordered chorionic villi that appear grossly as clusters of vesicular
= structures ("bunch of grapes").
27 Risk factors for hydatidiform mole include extremes of maternal age, prior hydatidiform mole,
* prior miscarriage, or infertility. ctivate V
