¢ CpG modifications: Promoter regions typically contain a section of 200-2000 base pairs

that primarily contain a cytosine followed a guanosine. Methylation of the CpG region

silences the adjacent gene; neoplasms often methylate CpG promoter regions adjacent to

genes that slow growth.

As part of oncogenesis, many glioblastomas methylate the CpG region adjacent to the O--
methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene, which generates a protein that repairs
damaged DNA (eg, converts O»-methylguanine [a naturally occurring alkylation product] back
to guanine). Although silencing MGMT creates a more permissive environment for DNA
mutations to drive cancer growth, it also makes the cell more susceptible to alkylating
chemotherapy (eg, temozolomide), since alkylating agents cause DNA damage that cannot
be effectively repaired without MGMT.

(Choice A) Mutation of tumor suppressing genes (eg, BAX) that trigger apoptosis or cell cycle
arrest promotes oncogenesis. However, MGMT is not an apoptotic gene.

(Choice B) As part of oncogenesis, tumors often reduce major histocompatibility complex
class | expression, lowering the ability of cytotoxic T cells to recognize the abnormal proteins
generated by cancerous cells. This process is not mediated by MGMT.
