A researcher is studying the Fas receptor (FasR), a protein widely expressed on cell surfaces.
The signaling cascade of programmed cell death is initiated when FasR binds to its ligand
(FasL), which is expressed on cytotoxic T cells. In an experiment, cancer cells that escaped
elimination by the immune system were found to contain soluble Fas proteins that did not
promote apoptosis. The soluble Fas proteins were shorter and lacked the transmembrane

domain. DNA analysis of these cells revealed no FAS gene mutations. Which of the following
is the most likely explanation for the formation of altered Fas proteins in these cancer cells?

©) A. Alternative splicing

©) B. Defective polyadenylation
© C. DNA methylation

©) D. Polycistronic mRNA

©) E. Protein ubiquitination
