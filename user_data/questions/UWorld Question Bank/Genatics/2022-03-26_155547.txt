Neoplasms develop genetic alterations that promote cellular growth and survival. Although
this is partially mediated by inactivating genetic mutations in tumor suppressor genes (eg,
p53), much of oncogenesis is mediated by the altered expression of unmutated genes, as
follows:

¢ Histone modification: Chromatin is organized into nucleosomes, which consist of a
segment of DNA wrapped around 8 histone proteins. Modification of histones via
acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation can alter the availability of DNA for
transcription, leading to increased or decreased gene expression. Histone modification
allows tumors to increase prosurvival gene expression and reduce cell cycle
arrest/apoptosis gene expression.

Transcription factor expression: Transcription factors are activated by cell-surface

ligand binding or by phosphorylation. Activated transcription factors travel to the nucleus

and bind to the promoter/enhancer region of a specific gene, which alters RNA polymerase

binding and subsequent gene expression. Tumors overexpress surface receptors (eg,

HER2) that generate pro-survival transcription factors and underexpress surface receptors

that generate cell cycle arrest/apoptotic signals. AGiVEKE Winelons
