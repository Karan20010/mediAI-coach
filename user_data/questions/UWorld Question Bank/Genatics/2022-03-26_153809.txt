degradation by the proteasome (ubiquitin-proteasome pathway).

Educational objective:

Nucleosomes are composed of DNA wrapped around a core of 8 histone proteins (2 molecules
each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). H1 histone is located outside of this histone core and helps
package nucleosomes into more compact structures by binding and linking the DNA between
adjacent nucleosomes.
