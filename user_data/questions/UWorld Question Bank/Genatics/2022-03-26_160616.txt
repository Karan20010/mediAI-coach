(Choice A) A condition inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern will be expressed in 50%
of offspring when 1 parent is affected. Classic examples include Huntington disease, Marfan
syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasias, and the neurofibromatoses.

(Choice B) Acondition inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion will be expressed in 25%
of offspring when both parents are carriers. Cystic fibrosis, hemochromatosis, and sickle cell
anemia are examples of autosomal recessive diseases.

(Choice C) Humans inherit mitochondrial DNA only from their mothers; therefore,
mitochondrial inheritance is purely maternal. Disorders transmitted via mitochondrial
inheritance display variable expressivity, meaning that severity of phenotypic expression can
differ greatly even among close relatives. Examples of mitochondrial diseases are myoclonic
epilepsy and Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

(Choice E) X-linked recessive inheritance refers to a trait that is passed via the X
chromosome in a recessive manner. Phenotypic expression in offspring is dependent on the
sex of the child; all males who inherit the X chromosome will display the phenotype whereas
only homozygous females will display the phenotype. Examples include Duchenne and
Becker muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and G6PD deficiency.
