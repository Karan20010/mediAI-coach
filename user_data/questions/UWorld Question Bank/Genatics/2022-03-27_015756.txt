DNA methylation refers to the addition of methyl groups to nucleotide residues (often adenine
and cytosine) by DNA methyltransferase, an enzyme that uses S-adenosyl-methionine
(SAM) as the methyl group donor.

DNA methylation is an epigenetic process by which eukaryotic organisms modify gene
expression without altering the genetic code. For example, methylation of cytosine-guanine
dinucleotide repeats (CpGs) in the promoter region of genes effectively silences transcription
of those genes. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked disorder caused by an increased number of
CGG trinucleotide repeats on the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FIMR7) gene, leading to
hypermethylation of cytosine residues and FMR7 inactivation.

Cytosine methylation is also used in genomic imprinting, a phenomenon in which an
offspring's genes are expressed in a parent-specific manner. For instance, an allele inherited
from the father may be inactivated or "imprinted" by methylation so that only the allele from the
mother is expressed.

(Choices A and D) Aneuploidy refers to the presence of an abnormal number of
chromosomes and is the result of chromosomal nondisjunction during mitosis or meiosis.

(Choice B) Epistasis is a phenomenon in which the allele of one gene affects the phenotypic

expression of alleles in another gene.
