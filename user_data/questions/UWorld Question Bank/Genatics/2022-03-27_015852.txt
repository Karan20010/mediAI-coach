(Choice D) Fibrotic fallopian tubes are not seen in Turner syndrome but are sometimes seen
in pelvic inflammatory disease.

(Choice E) Hirsutism and secondary amenorrhea can be seen in polycystic ovarian
syndrome.

(Choice F) Vaginal agenesis results from absence or underdevelopment of the Miullerian
ductal system (Millerian agenesis). Although patients with Miullerian agenesis have primary
amenorrhea, they will have normal palate and breast development.

Educational objective:

Common manifestations of Turner syndrome include primary amenorrhea, short stature, a high
arched palate, and widely spaced nipples. Primary amenorrhea occurs in these patients due
to in utero degeneration of the ovarian follicles (gonadal dysgenesis).
