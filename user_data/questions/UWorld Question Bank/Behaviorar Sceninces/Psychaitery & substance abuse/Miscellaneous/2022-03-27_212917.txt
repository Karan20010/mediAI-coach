(Choice D) The combination of restless sleep and excessive daytime somnolence in a patient

with multiple risk factors for OSA is less consistent with primary insomnia, which would be

appropriate when sleep-related symptoms are not better explained by another sleep disorder,

psychiatric disorder, or drugs/medications.

(Choice E) Although symptoms of somatic symptom disorder may include daily, severe
fatigue, this patient does not appear to have health-related anxiety (eg, fears about the
medical seriousness of physical symptoms), which is necessary for diagnosis.

Educational objective:

Obstructive sleep apnea is characterized by sleep-related apnea/choking spells, loud snoring,
disrupted sleep, excessive daytime somnolence, and symptoms that may overlap with
depression (eg, low mood, fatigue, impaired concentration).
