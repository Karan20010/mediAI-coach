(Choice B) Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic effects that can worsen
delirium. It may be used for the treatment of insomnia in other settings.

(Choice D) Lithium is a mood stabilizer. It is not used for the short-term treatment of
behavioral dyscontrol in nonmanic patients.

(Choices E and F) Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, temazepam) can worsen confusional
states, particularly in the elderly. Benzodiazepines are appropriate only for the treatment of
delirium due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal.

Educational objective:

Delirium may manifest as acute changes in cognition and behavior. When
nonpharmacological interventions are ineffective, low-dose antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) are
the medications of choice to treat the behavioral (eg, severe agitation) and psychotic
manifestations of delirium.
