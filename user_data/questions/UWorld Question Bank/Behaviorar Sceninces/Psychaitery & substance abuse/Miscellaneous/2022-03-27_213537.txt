This patient has developed opioid use disorder with dependency. Some patients benefit from
opioid replacement therapy, either indefinitely or as a bridge to gradual cessation.
Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid used to replace and treat dependency on
unregulated opioids (eg, heroin) due to its favorable pharmacokinetics.

As a partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor (ie, mixed agonist and antagonist activity),
buprenorphine has a ceiling effect. At higher doses, the agonist activity is equally opposed
by the antagonist activity, leading to a plateau (ceiling) in the dose-response curve. This
ceiling caps its analgesic potency but reduces unwanted adverse effects such as respiratory
depression. Therefore, high doses of buprenorphine carry a lower risk of respiratory
depression compared to full agonists such as heroin (Choice C).

A key drawback of partial agonists (eg, buprenorphine) is the potential to displace full
agonists from the receptor: partial agonists act as relative antagonists in the presence of full
agonists. Therefore, buprenorphine can precipitate acute withdrawal if administered when
receptors are still occupied by full agonists (eg, heroin). For this reason, patients must
discontinue opioids and partially enter the withdrawal state (eg, wait 48 hours) prior to the
initiation of buprenorphine.

(Choice A) Complete reversal of a full agonist (eg, heroin) requires a full antagonist (eg,
