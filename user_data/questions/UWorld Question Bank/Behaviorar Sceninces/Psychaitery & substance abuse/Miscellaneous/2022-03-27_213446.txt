This acute onset of mental status change is most suggestive of delirium. Delirium is a
reversible, acute confusional state involving a reduced or fluctuating level of
consciousness (eg, somnolent to combative within a short time); there are difficulties
sustaining attention and significantly impaired memory and executive function. It is most
commonly seen in elderly patients with medical illness and is often associated with anxiety,
agitation, delusions, and/or hallucinations. Patients of advanced age and with neurologic
conditions such as Parkinson disease, dementia, and prior stroke are more likely to develop
delirium due to reduced cognitive reserve.

The presence of delirium in this patient indicates an unstable underlying medical condition that
must be identified and treated. The patient's elevated temperature and bronchial breath
sounds are likely due to an underlying pulmonary infection. Once the underlying medical
condition is effectively treated, the delirium should resolve.

(Choices A, E, and F) In contrast to delirium, the dementia in Alzheimer disease,
frontotemporal dementia, and vascular dementia is gradual in onset and progressive without
much fluctuation. In Alzheimer disease, attention and remote memory are spared initially, and
there is no impairment of consciousness until late in the disease. Frontotemporal dementia
presents with early behavior change (eg, disinhibition, apathy), followed later by memory
