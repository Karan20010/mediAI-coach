presents with early behavior change (eg, disinhibition, apathy), followed later by memory
impairments. Vascular dementia involves a stepwise decline typically associated with focal
neurologic signs and does not impair consciousness in the early stages. Although this
patient's mild cognitive impairments over the past year may gradually progress to dementia,
they would not explain his acute confusional state, which is a rapid change from his baseline.

(Choice B) Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by the sudden onset of psychotic
symptoms lasting 21 day but <1 month that is not better explained by another medical
condition. In contrast to patients with delirium, those with psychotic disorders are typically alert
and oriented.

(Choice D) Major depression can sometimes be accompanied by delusions or hallucinations
(eg, voices telling patients they are worthless). The absence of current depressive symptoms,
acute onset, and fluctuating level of consciousness make this diagnosis unlikely.

Educational objective:

Delirium is a reversible, acute-onset confusional state characterized by a fluctuating level of
consciousness with deficits in attention, memory, and executive function. In contrast,
dementia has a gradual onset, is irreversible, and does not involve fluctuations in

consciousness.
