(Choice A) Complete reversal of a full agonist (eg, heroin) requires a full antagonist (eg,
naloxone). Because buprenorphine is a partial agonist-antagonist, the degree of reversal is
limited by the ceiling effect.
(Choice D) The ability of antagonists to displace bound drugs is determined by the affinity of

the drug-receptor interaction. Drugs that bind tightly have a steep binding curve; in other
words, a lower concentration of drug is required to achieve the same effect. Buprenorphine
has a higher affinity to the mu receptor than heroin, which is apparent from its steeper binding
curve. Overdose with buprenorphine often requires repeated, high doses of naloxone due to
this higher affinity.

Educational objective:

Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid with mixed/partial agonist-antagonist activity, resulting
in a therapeutic ceiling. Relative to full opioid agonists, this reduces the risk of dose-
dependent adverse effects such as respiratory depression.
