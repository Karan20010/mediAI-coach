Epileptiform discharges often start from a specific focus (eg, temporal or frontal lobe) and may
or may not generalize. This can cause rhythmic jerking and myoclonus, but complex motor
behaviors corresponding with dream content (ie, dream enactment) are more consistent with
RBD. Furthermore, REM sleep is somewhat protective in epilepsy; seizures most often occur
during non-REM (NREM) sleep.

(Choice D) This describes EEG findings that are common in NREM parasomnias (eg, sleep
terrors, sleep walking). Although these can present with movement during sleep, patients are
not alert upon awakening and have no memory of the event. In addition, NREM parasomnias
most commonly present in childhood.

(Choice E) Short sleep latency and sleep-onset REM periods are characteristic of narcolepsy,
a disorder characterized by chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, intrusions of REM sleep
phenomena (eg, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and cataplexy (emotionally
triggered muscle weakness). Narcolepsy typically begins in young adulthood.

Educational objective:

REM sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enactment behaviors
due to a loss of atonia during REM sleep. Patients can usually be awakened fairly easily, are
alert and oriented, and can immediately recall their dreams.
