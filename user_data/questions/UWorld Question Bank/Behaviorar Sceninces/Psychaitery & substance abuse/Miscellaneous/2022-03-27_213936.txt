This patient's subjective report of severe pain and distress without objective findings (normal
physical examination, repeated hospitalizations without diagnosis), refusal to provide release
for prior medical records, and evidence of external gain (time off from work) are suggestive of
malingering. Malingering is a behavior characterized by intentional falsification or
exaggeration of symptoms to obtain an obvious external reward (eg, medications, financial
gain, avoidance of work responsibilities or criminal prosecution). These patients often have a
dramatic presentation based on subjective complaints rather than objective findings and may
refuse to provide a release of information.

Malingering should be differentiated from factitious disorder, in which the patient intentionally
falsifies symptoms with the goal of assuming the patient role, rather than obtaining an external
reward. Patients with factitious disorder often welcome invasive diagnostic testing and
surgical procedures. In contrast, patients who are malingering will often refuse to undergo

invasive medical procedures.

(Choice A) Chronic feelings of helplessness are associated with depression and some
personality disorders. Although patients with these disorders may also be preoccupied with
somatic symptoms, they do not intentionally exaggerate or falsify their symptoms for an

external gain like this patient.
