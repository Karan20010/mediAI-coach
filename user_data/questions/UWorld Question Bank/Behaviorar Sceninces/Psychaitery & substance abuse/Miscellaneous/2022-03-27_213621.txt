symptoms, and given her recent stress (eg, her father's heart attack), conversion disorder is
more likely.
(Choice D) Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive fears of having a serious
physical disease. The fear is usually due to misinterpretation of bodily symptoms or normal
functions (eg, a man with gas pain becoming preoccupied with having colon cancer).

(Choice E) Malingering is the purposeful falsification of symptoms for obvious external benefit
(eg, a patient feigning hemiparesis to receive disability benefits).

(Choice F) Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent health
anxiety and preoccupation with multiple somatic symptoms; it does not present with a clearly
incompatible neurological examination. This patient does not express any concern about her
impairment and seeks care only when brought in by her roommate, effectively ruling out

somatic symptom disorder.

Educational objective:

Conversion disorder is characterized by neurologic symptoms and examination findings that
are incompatible with a known neurological disease. Patients do not consciously produce the
symptoms like in factitious disorder or malingering, and the condition may cause significant

distress/impairment.
