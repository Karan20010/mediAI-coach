reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram and was likely prescribed tramadol, an opioid analgesic
that also has serotonergic activity. Tramadol acts as a mu opioid receptor agonist and
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and, in combination with an SSRI, can
potentially cause serotonin syndrome.

Onset of serotonin syndrome typically occurs within the first 24 hours after a change in dose or
initiation of a serotonergic medication, and typically presents with the classic triad of mental
status changes, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular hyperactivity. In addition,
stimulation of serotonin receptors in the gut commonly results in gastrointestinal symptoms
(eg, diarrhea) and hyperactive bowel sounds. Patients taking SSRIs should be cautioned
about the risk of serotonin syndrome when a medication with serotonergic activity is added.
Tramadol (or other causative agent) should be discontinued promptly if serotonin syndrome

occurs.
