Hypokalemia in an otherwise healthy young adult with a normal BMI and preoccupation with
body shape and weight is concerning for self-induced vomiting associated with bulimia

nervosa (BN). BN is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by

a

compensatory behaviors (eg, vomiting, laxative use, fasting, excessive exercise) to prevent
weight gain. Because patients may not be forthcoming about their eating behavior due to
embarrassment, physical examination and laboratory assessment can assist in making the
diagnosis. Painless bilateral parotid gland enlargement due to repetitive vomiting is a
common finding.

Other signs of BN include tachycardia, hypotension, dry skin, calluses or scarring on the
dorsum of the hand (Russell sign), and erosion of dental enamel. Common electrolyte
abnormalities in BN include hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

(Choices A, B, and D) BN is more commonly associated with tachycardia, dry skin, and
hypotension rather than bradycardia (typically seen in anorexia nervosa), diaphoresis, and
hypertension.

(Choice C) Goiter can be asymptomatic or associated with symptoms of hypothyroidism or
hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism can present with fatigue and constipation but would not

explain this patient's hypokalemia.
