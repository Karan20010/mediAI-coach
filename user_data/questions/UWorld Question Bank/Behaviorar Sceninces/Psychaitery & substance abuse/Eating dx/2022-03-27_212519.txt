This patient's hypotension, tachycardia, dental erosion, and electrolyte abnormalities (eg,
hypokalemia, hypochloremia, elevated bicarbonate [likely due to metabolic alkalosis]) are

consistent with self-induced vomiting, suggesting a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa (BN).
Chronic vomiting can also result in calluses on the dorsum of the hands (Russell sign) and
enlarged parotid glands with resultant increased salivary amylase.

Patients with BN are excessively preoccupied with their weight and shape and engage in
repeated episodes of binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors (eg, vomiting,
laxatives, diuretics, fasting, excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain. Other common signs
of BN include dry skin, menstrual irregularities, abdominal bloating, and constipation.

(Choice A) Serum amylase, which does not typically differentiate between salivary and
pancreatic origins, can be elevated in both pancreatic disease and BN; however, lipase would
also be significantly increased in pancreatic disease, whereas this patient has increased
amylase alone. Acute pancreatitis commonly presents with pain and an acute abdomen.

(Choice B) With heavy alcohol use, expected findings would include elevated liver enzymes
and other signs suggestive of abuse and dependence (eq, inability to control drinking, use in
hazardous situations, tolerance, withdrawal symptoms).
