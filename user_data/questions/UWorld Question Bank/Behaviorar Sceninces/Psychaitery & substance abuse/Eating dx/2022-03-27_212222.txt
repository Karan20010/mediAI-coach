This patient's recurrent episodes of eating large amounts of food and sense of loss of
control, together with compensatory behaviors (fasting, exercising) to prevent weight gain, is
consistent with bulimia nervosa (BN). Patients with BN are excessively preoccupied with
their weight and body shape. Although self-induced vomiting is the most common
compensatory behavior, patients may also fast and exercise excessively or misuse laxatives,
enemas, diuretics, or diet pills. In DSM-5, both binges and inappropriate compensatory
behaviors must occur at least once a week for 3 months for diagnosis. Patients with BN are
normal weight or overweight, in contrast to individuals with anorexia nervosa.

Signs of BN in patients who vomit regularly may include hypotension, tachycardia, dry skin,
menstrual irregularities, erosion of dental enamel, parotid hypertrophy, calloused knuckles, and
electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis).

(Choice A) This patient's depressive and guilty feelings after a binge are characteristic of BN.
(Choice B) Both BN and anorexia nervosa may be characterized by preoccupation with
weight, binge eating, and compensatory behavior (there is a binge-eating/purging subtype of
anorexia). Patients with anorexia nervosa have significantly low body weight (BMI <18.5
kg/m). In BN, body weight is typically normal to increased.
