gestation. The patient, who has not gained weight since her last visit 4 weeks ago, has
occasional nausea with vomiting twice a week. She has little appetite, which she attributes to
mild indigestion, and her food consumption has decreased. However, the patient craves ice
and has been consuming it throughout the day for the last few months. Medications include
daily prenatal vitamins. The patient was prescribed twice-daily iron for anemia but does not
take it because it causes constipation. She has no diarrhea, dysuria, chills, or fever. The
