This patient's symptoms of irritable mood, impulsivity, hyperactivity, pressured speech,
decreased need for sleep, and grandiose delusions lasting 21 week meet the criteria for a
manic episode (Table). Although an elevated mood typifies a manic episode, an irritable
mood is commonly seen. Patients with 21 manic episodes are diagnosed with bipolar |
disorder; although most bipolar | patients will experience both major depressive and manic
episodes, depressive episodes are not required for diagnosis of bipolar |. Manic episodes can
occur with or without psychotic features (eg, delusions, hallucinations).

Bipolar disorder with psychotic features may be differentiated from a primary psychotic
disorder (eg, schizoaffective disorder bipolar type) based on the temporal relationship between
the mood disturbance and the psychosis. In psychotic disorders, psychotic symptoms must
persist in the absence of mood symptoms. This patient's psychosis has occurred only in the
presence of severe manic symptoms, making bipolar | disorder the more likely diagnosis.

(Choice B) Bipolar II disorder involves hypomanic episodes (less severe than mania and
without psychotic features) and major depressive episodes.

(Choice C) Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by acute onset of 21 psychotic symptoms
lasting 21 days but <1 month, with eventual complete resolution. The diagnosis cannot be

made when psychotic symptoms occur only in the context of a manic episode, as in this
