A 22-year-old college student seeks treatment for depressed mood, low energy, poor
concentration, and feelings of worthlessness and guilt following a breakup with her partner of 2
years. She is diagnosed with major depression and treated with bupropion and
psychotherapy. After 3 weeks of treatment, the patient reports that her energy and motivation
have improved somewhat. Her grades, which had been deteriorating, have stabilized. The
patient is also continuing to receive psychotherapy and believes that it is beneficial. However,
she still feels "really down" at times and has a poor appetite. Further history suggests that the
patient consumes very little food each day (a pattern that preceded her use of bupropion) and
exercises excessively. Due to her ongoing mood problems, increasing the dose of her
antidepressant medication is considered. Which of the following potential side effects of the
increased dose would be of primary concern?

(©) A. Agranulocytosis
©) B. Hypertension
© C. Seizures

©) D. Sexual dysfunction
