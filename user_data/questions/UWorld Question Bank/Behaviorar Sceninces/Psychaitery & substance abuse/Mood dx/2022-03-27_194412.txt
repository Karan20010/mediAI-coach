This patient's loss of interest, weight loss, hypersomnia, low energy level, and impaired

concentration are concerning for major depressive disorder (MDD). Depressed
adolescents may experience feelings of annoyance and irritability rather than sadness.
Other common signs are loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, changes in academic
functioning and relationships with peers and family, feelings of worthlessness/inappropriate
guilt, and suicidal thoughts.

Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents age 15-19 years. Any adolescent
with behavioral changes should be assessed for suicidal ideation, which has an immediate
impact on safety and acute management (eg, an actively suicidal patient may require
hospitalization). Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to assess this patient for suicidal
thoughts.

(Choice A) This patient's recent difficulty concentrating is one of multiple symptoms
characteristic of depression. In attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, concentration difficulties
are chronic, with typical onset prior to adolescence.

(Choice B) It would be inappropriate to involve the parents prior to fully assessing the patient
and his safety.

(Choices C and D) Acomplete blood count and thyroid function testing may be included as PCEVENO
