This patient's persistent depressive symptoms at her 6-week postpartum visit (increasing
fatigue/low energy, depressed mood/frequent tearfulness, sleep disturbance, poor appetite,
feelings of worthlessness) are concerning for postpartum depression (PPD). PPD is
diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria used to diagnose a major depressive
episode (22 weeks of at least 5 of 9 symptoms that include depressed mood plus
SIGECAPS: Sleep disturbance, loss of Interest, Guilt/worthlessness, low Energy, impaired
Concentration, change in Appetite, Psychomotor retardation or agitation, and Suicidal
thoughts). PPD is common, and all patients should be screened for postpartum depression at
the 6-week postpartum visit. Untreated postpartum depression is associated with impaired
maternal-infant bonding and negatively impacts both maternal and infant health.

(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, exposure to a life-threatening trauma results in symptoms
of reexperiencing (ie, intrusive memories, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, negative
mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal. This patient had an uncomplicated delivery, and her
symptoms are more consistent with a major depressive episode.

(Choice B) Although being a new parent is a significant stressor, adjustment disorder is

diagnosed only if symptoms do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder, such as
major depressive disorder.
