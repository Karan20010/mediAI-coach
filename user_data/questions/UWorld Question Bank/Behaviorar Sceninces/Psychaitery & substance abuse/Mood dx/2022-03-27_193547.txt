Cognitive impairment is a common symptom of late-life depression. Depression-related
cognitive impairment (previously termed pseudodementia) refers to a syndrome of reversible
cognitive impairment that can mimic mild cognitive impairment or dementia. This patient's
acute development of cognitive impairment coincident with depressive symptoms of sleep
disturbance, decreased appetite, low energy, feelings of worthlessness, and loss of interest is
consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD).

Treatment of depression-related cognitive impairment consists of treating the underlying MDD
with psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. The cognitive and mood symptoms should
resolve with adequate treatment of MDD. In contrast, the cognitive deficits in patients with
dementia are irreversible and will gradually worsen despite treatment.

memory impairment), dementia with Lewy bodies (visual hallucinations, parkinsonism),
frontotemporal dementia (early personality changes), and vascular dementia (stepwise
neurological deficits,cerebrovascular disease). However, this patient's acute cognitive
impairment (~1 month) in conjunction with his depressive symptoms makes MDD a more likely
diagnosis.

Choice E) Normal age-related cognitive changes may include difficulty remembering names
