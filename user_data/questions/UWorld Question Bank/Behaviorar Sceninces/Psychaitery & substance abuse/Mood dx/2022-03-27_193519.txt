(Choice B) Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is used in treatment-resistant
cases of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder but is not a first-line treatment because of the risk of
life-threatening agranulocytosis.

(Choice C) Benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam) are not indicated for bipolar maintenance
treatment and are associated with the risk of abuse and dependence.

(Choice E) Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic that may be used to treat acute
mania. However, it is not used for long-term bipolar maintenance due to its adverse effect
profile (eg, dyskinesia).

Educational objective:

The goal of bipolar maintenance treatment is to delay or prevent recurrent manic and
depressive episodes. Lithium is first-line treatment and has the added benefit of reducing the
risk of suicide.
