is patient is experiencing a hypertensive emergency (eg, severe hypertension, headache,
blurry vision) and has signs of excessive sympathetic activity (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis,
tremors), most likely due to a food-drug interaction between tyramine-containing foods (eg,
aged cheeses, cured meats, draft beer) and a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.

MAO inhibitors increase the availability of all 3 major monoamines (eg, dopamine,
norepinephrine, serotonin) by inhibiting MAO, a mitochondrial enzyme that normally breaks
down monoamines. Tyramine is an indirect sympathomimetic found in certain foods (eg, aged
cheeses, cured meats, draft beer) that is usually broken down in the gastrointestinal tract by
MAO. In MAO inhibitor—treated patients, tyramine escapes degradation and enters the
systemic circulation, leading to a hypertensive crisis.

Due to the risks of tyramine-induced hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome, MAO
inhibitors are typically reserved for treatment-resistant depression.

(Choice A) MAO inhibitors do not affect the binding of monoamines to their receptors.
Examples of commonly used monoamine receptor blockers include dopamine receptor
antagonists (eg, antipsychotics) and adrenergic receptor antagonists (eg, mirtazapine).

(Choice C) MAO inhibitors do not affect presynaptic monoamine uptake.

Choices D, E, and F) Other classes of antidepressant medications that work by blocking
