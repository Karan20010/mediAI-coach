All patients with a major depressive episode should be screened for a past history of manic

episodes to differentiate major depressive disorder (unipolar depression) from bipolar
disorder. This is particularly relevant in this patient as his atypically rapid response to the
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline is suggestive of treatment-emergent mania. If
further history substantiates a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, antidepressant monotherapy
should be avoided, as all antidepressants carry a risk of inducing mania.

Bipolar patients in the depressed phase may be misdiagnosed with unipolar major depressive
disorder when either the physician neglects to ask about past manic symptoms or patients do
not report them due to limited insight, difficulty recalling, or a tendency to minimize past manic
episodes. Physicians should question patients regarding a history of distinct periods of
elevated mood and increased energy, decreased need for sleep, hyperactivity, racing
thoughts, and uncharacteristic risk-taking behavior.

(Choices A, B, and F) Acomplete blood count, metabolic panel, and urine toxicology screen
are not priorities for this patient with no new physical symptoms, normal physical examination,
and minimal substance use. Selected laboratory tests should be performed in cases of
treatment-resistant depression or in patients who experience new-onset physical symptoms
along with depression (eg, thyroid function tests in a patient with signs of hypothyroidism).
