(Choices D, E, and F) Other classes of antidepressant medications that work by blocking
presynaptic uptake are selective for 1 or 2 neurotransmitters. Selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors block presynaptic serotonin reuptake and are used first-line for depression and many
anxiety disorders. Atomoxetine is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used in attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder. Dual reuptake inhibitors include tricyclic antidepressants, which inhibit
serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, and bupropion, a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake
inhibitor used to treat depression and tobacco dependence.

Educational objective:

Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is a mitochondrial enzyme that breaks down monoamine
neurotransmitters (eg, dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin). Tyramine-induced hypertensive
crisis can occur in patients taking MAO inhibitors who consume foods containing high amounts
of tyramine (eg, aged cheeses, cured meats, draft beer).
