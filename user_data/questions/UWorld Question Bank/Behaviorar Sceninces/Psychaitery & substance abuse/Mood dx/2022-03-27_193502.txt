A 48-year-old man is hospitalized due to severe depression. The patient became increasingly
depressed over the past month and stopped going to work last week because he was
unmotivated to get out of bed. He sleeps up to 16 hours a day, has no energy, and has gained
4.54 kg (10 Ib) over the past month. The patient has had daily thoughts of suicide for the past
week but says he will not act on them because of his children. He also describes several
weeklong periods when he had extra energy and took on many projects at once. During these
times, the patient rarely slept and believed he had superhuman powers to control other
people's minds with his eyes. Physical and laboratory evaluations are unremarkable. Which
of the following medications would be most appropriate for long-term management of this
patient?
