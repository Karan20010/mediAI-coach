Diagnosis of major depressive disorder in patients with cancer is challenging as somatic
symptoms of depression overlap with those of cancer and/or the adverse effects of cancer
treatments. This patient's weight loss, low energy, and sleep disturbance may also be due to
metastatic cancer and/or chemotherapy. Therefore, these somatic symptoms are less reliable
indicators of major depression (Choices B, C, and E).

Nonsomatic depressive symptoms (eg, feelings of worthlessness, excessive guilt, and
suicidal ideation) are more reliable for diagnosing depression in patients with advanced
medical illness. This patient's withdrawal and inability to enjoy family visits (ie, loss of
interest and anhedonia) are therefore the most concerning symptoms for major depression.

(Choice D) Thinking about death and dying is normal in patients with advanced cancer and a
poor prognosis. If the patient's thoughts of death included suicidal ideation, intent, or plan, this
would be indicative of major depression.

Educational objective:

Somatic symptoms of depression (weight loss, low energy, sleep disturbance) are less reliable
indicators of major depressive disorder in patients with advanced medical illness. Focusing on
nonsomatic symptoms, such as loss of interest, anhedonia, worthlessness, excessive guilt,
and suicidality, can assist in diagnosing comorbid depression in these patients.
