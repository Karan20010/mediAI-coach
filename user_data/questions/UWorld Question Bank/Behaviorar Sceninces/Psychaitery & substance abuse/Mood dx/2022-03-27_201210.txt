A 32-year-old man is diagnosed with major depressive disorder and started on the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline. At his 2-week follow-up, the patient reports that his
mood is "about the same." He continues to feel sad and unmotivated most days and is short-
tempered with his wife and kids. He has little interest in food, sleeps poorly, and struggles to
stay focused at work. In the first 2-3 days of taking the medication, the patient experienced
some mild nausea and anxiety that has since resolved. He is now tolerating the medication
without difficulty but is considering stopping it because he is discouraged by the lack of clear
improvement. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's lack of
response?

©) A. Comorbid anxiety disorder

©) B. Development of tolerance

|) C. Inadequate duration of treatment
©) D. Medication side effect

©) E. Poor treatment adherence

() F. Treatment-resistant depression Activate Windows
