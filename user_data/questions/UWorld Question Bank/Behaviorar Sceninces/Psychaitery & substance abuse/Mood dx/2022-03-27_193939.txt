The pathophysiologic basis of depression is hypothesized to involve the dysregulation of
monoamine (eg, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine) neurotransmission. Most
antidepressant medications act by various mechanisms to increase synaptic concentrations of
these neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme
located in presynaptic nerve terminals that is responsible for the breakdown of monoamine
neurotransmitters. Phenelzine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, works by irreversibly
binding and inhibiting both types of MAO: A and B. This results in increased presynaptic
availability of monoamine neurotransmitters, thereby increasing their release into the synaptic
cleft. Because phenelzine irreversibly inhibits MAO, it may take up to 2 weeks following
discontinuation of the drug before MAO is resynthesized to a level adequate for normal
monoamine degradation.

Sertraline is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) that specifically increases synaptic
serotonin levels. Coadministration of an SSRI and an MAO inhibitor is contraindicated due to
the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially fatal condition characterized by altered mental
status, neuromuscular excitation (eg, hyperreflexia, clonus), and autonomic hyperactivity (eg,
hyperthermia, tachycardia, diaphoresis). To avoid serotonin syndrome, patients must wait at
least 2 weeks after MAO inhibitor discontinuation before initiating SSRI therapy, thereby
