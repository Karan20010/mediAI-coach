(Choice D) Sexual dysfunction is a relatively common side effect of selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which limits their use for many patients. Bupropion has no effect
on serotonin and does not cause sexual dysfunction. It can be used as an adjunct to treat
SSRI-related sexual dysfunction.

(Choice E) Rash, including life-threatening Stevens-Johnson syndrome, rarely occurs with
bupropion. It is more commonly seen with the anticonvulsant lamotrigine, which is used to
treat bipolar depression.

(Choice F) Bupropion is either weight neutral or associated with mild weight loss.

Educational objective:

Bupropion is a first-line antidepressant that is not associated with sexual side effects or weight
gain. However, it is associated with an increased seizure risk at high doses and is
contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia.
