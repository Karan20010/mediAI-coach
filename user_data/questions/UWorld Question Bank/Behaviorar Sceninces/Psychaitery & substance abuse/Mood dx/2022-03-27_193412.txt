syndrome.

(Choice B) Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.
Sexual dysfunction is the most common long-term side effect. SSRIs are not used as
monotherapy in bipolar disorder and are not associated with hypothyroidism.

(Choice C) Clozapine, a second-generation antipsychotic indicated for treatment-refractory
schizophrenia, is associated with agranulocytosis and requires regular monitoring of the
absolute neutrophil count. Although clozapine can cause weight gain and constipation, it is not
a first-line treatment for mood disorders and would not explain this patient's other hypothyroid
features (eg, dry skin, hair loss, bradycardia).

(Choice F) Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic that can cause weight gain and
hyperprolactinemia (eg, galactorrhea, amenorrhea). It is not associated with hypothyroidism.
(Choice G) Trazodone is an antidepressant that has significant sedating effects and is most

commonly used to treat depression-related insomnia. Other adverse effects include priapism
(prolonged painful erection) and anticholinergic effects (eg, dry mouth, constipation).
