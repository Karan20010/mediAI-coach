This patient's grandiose ideas about his special mission, impulsive risk-taking behavior, and
decreased need for sleep lasting 21 week are suggestive of a manic episode consistent
with bipolar | disorder. Other features of mania include elevated/euphoric/irritable mood,
increased energy, and hyperactivity. Increased production, volume, and rate of speech (ie,
pressured speech) and a sense that one's thoughts are moving very quickly (ie, racing
thoughts) are also common.

Diagnosis of bipolar | disorder requires 21 manic episodes, although most bipolar patients will
experience both major depressive and manic episodes in their lifetime. Manic episodes can
occur with or without psychotic features (eg, delusions, hallucinations). Pharmacotherapy for
acute mania includes mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate and second-generation
antipsychotics (eg, risperidone).

(Choices A, C, and G) Flat affect (ie, reduced emotional expressiveness), decreased
attention to personal hygiene, and thought blocking (ie, sudden inability to finish a thought) are
findings typical of schizophrenia. In contrast, patients with bipolar disorder exhibit intense and
labile affect, increased thought productivity, and pressured speech. These patients may wear
garish clothing and makeup but typically do not neglect their hygiene.
