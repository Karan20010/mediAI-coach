A 39-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department after her husband found her
confused. The patient was unable to answer questions about why she did not go to work that
day and could not remember the day of the week. She has a history of bipolar disorder and
has taken the same dose of lithium for the past 10 years. Over the past week, the patient
started taking several daily doses of a new medication following a dental extraction.

Yesterday, she felt nauseated and vomited twice, and earlier today, she started having
diarrhea. Vital signs are within normal limits. The patient is alert and oriented to self only. The
abdomen is soft and nontender with increased bowel sounds. Coarse tremors are noted in the
upper extremities. Deep tendon reflexes are 2+ in the bilateral extremities. Gait is mildly
ataxic. A drug interaction involving which of the following medications is most likely causing
this patient's symptoms?
