Lithium has a very narrow therapeutic index. Patients with acute toxicity initially develop
symptoms of gastrointestinal upset (eg, vomiting, diarrhea) with later development of
neurologic findings (eg, neuromuscular excitability, delirium) as the drug penetrates the central
nervous system. However, chronic lithium toxicity generally presents with gradual onset of
neurologic symptoms, such as this patient's worsening ataxia and tremor.

Lithium is similar to sodium in its properties and is almost exclusively excreted by the kidneys.
Like sodium, it is filtered and reabsorbed mostly in the proximal tubules (>60%). Any cause of
decreased glomerular filtration (eg, volume depletion, congestive heart failure, cirrhosis) can
increase proximal sodium/lithium reabsorption and lead to increased lithium retention.

Thiazide diuretics limit sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule, causing mild volume
depletion (and potential hyponatremia) that stimulates proximal tubular sodium/lithium
reabsorption, leading to lithium toxicity over time. ACE inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also impair lithium clearance and lead to toxicity.

(Choice A) Amiloride is a potassium-sparing diuretic that works primarily on the distal tubule
and collecting duct by inhibiting sodium reabsorption. Potassium-sparing diuretics often
decrease serum lithium levels.
