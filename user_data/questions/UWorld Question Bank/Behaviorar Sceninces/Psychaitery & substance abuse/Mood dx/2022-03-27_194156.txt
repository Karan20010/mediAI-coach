synaptic norepinephrine accumulation is not the mechanism by which death occurs following
TCA overdose.

(Choice D) Serotonin syndrome must be considered in suspected antidepressant overdose.
Patients with serotonin syndrome have hyperthermia, autonomic instability, hyperreflexia,
myoclonus, and diaphoresis. Cardiac changes are not usually indicative of serotonin
syndrome. Although symptoms of excess serotonin may be present after TCA overdose, most
deaths are due to cardiac toxicity.

(Choice E) TCAs do not increase presynaptic release of dopamine. Amphetamines increase
the release of dopamine (and norepinephrine) by vesicles in presynaptic neurons.

Educational objective:

Tricyclic antidepressant overdose can cause fatal cardiac arrhythmias and refractory
hypotension due to inhibition of fast sodium channels in cardiac myocytes. Sodium
bicarbonate is used to treat associated cardiac toxicity and works by increasing serum pH and
extracellular sodium (alleviating fast sodium channel blockade).
