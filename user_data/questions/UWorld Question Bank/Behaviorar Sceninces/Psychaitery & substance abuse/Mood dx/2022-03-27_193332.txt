TCAs due to their antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. However, these
side effects are rarely seen with SSRIs.

(Choices D and H) SSRIs are associated with a slightly increased risk of seizures and weight
gain, but these effects are less common than sexual dysfunction. Seizures are more of a
concern in patients taking TCAs and the norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor
bupropion.

(Choice E) Serotonin syndrome can occur if an SSRI is combined with another serotonergic

agent, such as an MAOI, or an illicit serotonergic substance, such as MDMA. It would be
uncommon in a patient taking a single serotonergic drug at a normal dosage.

Educational objective:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have improved tolerability and a better side-
effect profile compared with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors but
are associated with sexual dysfunction. Physicians should routinely inquire about sexual
dysfunction because it is a relatively common side effect of SSRIs that may lead to
nonadherence.
