This patient most likely has postpartum blues, a normal, self-limiting condition that occurs
within a few days postpartum. Symptoms include mild depressive symptoms (eg, sadness,
insomnia, tearfulness, irritability, anxiety, impaired concentration). These symptoms typically
peak at 5 days and resolve within 14 days.

The most appropriate response would be to reassure the patient that postpartum mood
changes are common and to monitor her closely with instructions to call back if she does not
start to improve. If symptoms do not remit spontaneously by day 14, a follow-up should be
scheduled. Waiting until the 6-week postpartum check would be inadequate as women with
postpartum blues are at increased risk of developing postpartum depression, which typically
presents within 4-6 weeks of delivery (Choice C). The much rarer postpartum psychosis can
present with delusions and command hallucinations to kill the infant and represents a
psychiatric emergency.

(Choice A) There is no evidence that the patient is unable to care for the infant, and this
statement is likely to be perceived as critical. Asking the patient whether she has any
concerns about caring for her infant or needs extra support would be more appropriate.

(Choices B and E) Because this patient is calling on day 5 (often the peak of postpartum
blues), it would be premature to refer her to a counselor or to diagnose or treat postpartum
