changes) is responsible for the delayed clinical effects of antidepressants.

(Choice E) Presynaptic monoaminergic neurons actively take up norepinephrine, dopamine,
and serotonin through reuptake transporters and repackage them into synaptic vesicles for
future neurotransmission. Monoamine reuptake inhibitors, such as tricyclic antidepressants
and SSRIs, work by blocking this reuptake.

Educational objective:

Coadministration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and monoamine oxidase
(MAO) inhibitors can produce excessive synaptic serotonin levels secondary to decreased
reuptake and decreased degradation of serotonin, potentially causing serotonin syndrome. To
avoid this risk, a 2-week washout period after discontinuing an MAO inhibitor and before
initiating SSRI therapy is required to allow sufficient time for MAO regeneration.
