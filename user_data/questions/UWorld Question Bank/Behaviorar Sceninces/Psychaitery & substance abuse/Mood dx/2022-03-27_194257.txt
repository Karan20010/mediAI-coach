This patient's presentation is consistent with major depressive disorder (MDD) with
psychotic features. This disorder is a severe subtype of MDD in which the patient develops
psychotic symptoms exclusively during a depressive episode. This patient's 22 weeks of
depressed mood, impaired concentration, decreased appetite/weight loss, sleep disturbance,
and suicidal ideation meet criteria for MDD, and his psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions of
causing evil, auditory hallucinations) specify the psychotic features subtype. Delusions and
hallucinations are commonly mood congruent and have depressive themes (eg, deserved
punishment, worthlessness, nihilism), although mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms
(unrelated to depressive themes) can also occur.

Differentiating MDD with psychotic features from MDD without psychotic features is important
as treatment differs. Patients with MDD with psychotic features require combined treatment
with an antidepressant and antipsychotic or electroconvulsive therapy.

(Choice A) This patient has no history of mania or hypomania, thereby ruling out bipolar
disorder.

(Choice B) In delusional disorder, patients experience delusions but no other psychotic
symptoms for at least a month. Mood symptoms, if present, are brief and not a prominent part
of the illness.
