(Choice B) Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.
SSRI monotherapy is avoided in bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania. SSRIs
have no role in the treatment of seizures.

(Choices C and F) Levetiracetam and phenytoin are anticonvulsants used in the treatment of
epilepsy but they are not useful for treating bipolar disorder.

(Choice D) Lithium is a mood stabilizer that is effective for the treatment of bipolar disorder.
Lithium is thought to modify second messenger signal transduction (eg, adenylyl cyclase and
phospho-inositol pathways) at several levels, resulting in decreased excitatory
neurotransmission. Lithium is not an anticonvulsant.

(Choice E) Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine that enhances the affinity of GABA for its receptor
(increases frequency of chloride channel openings), thereby increasing its inhibitory potential.
Lorazepam is a first-line medication for the treatment of active seizures, acute anxiety, and
alcohol withdrawal.

Educational objective:

Lithium and the anticonvulsants valproate, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are mood-
stabilizing agents used in bipolar disorder. Valproate is commonly used in the treatment of

generalized as well as myoclonic seizures. ctivate V
