Sertraline is one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) frequently used as
first-line antidepressant therapy. Compared with older antidepressants (eg, tricyclic
antidepressants [TCAs]), SSRIs have minimal activity at alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, and
histaminic receptors. They are generally more tolerable and significantly safer in overdose.
However, SSRIs commonly cause sexual dysfunction, including decreased libido, decreased
arousal, anorgasmia in women, and increased ejaculation latency in men. Sexual dysfunction
can occur in more than 50% of patients receiving SSRIs and is a frequent cause of
nonadherence. Physicians should routinely assess SSRI-treated patients for sexual
dysfunction because some may be reluctant to discuss this side effect.

(Choice A) Although SSRIs can prolong the QT interval slightly, they are unlikely to cause
arrhythmias when used in recommended doses in patients who lack other risk factors.
Cardiac arrhythmias are a serious side effect of TCA overdose.

(Choice B) This patient's hypertension is well controlled. Hypertensive crisis is not associated
with SSRIs but may occur if a patient taking a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) ingests
foods containing tyramine.

(Choices C and G) Orthostatic hypotension and urinary hesitancy are common side effects of
TCAs due to their antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors. However, these
