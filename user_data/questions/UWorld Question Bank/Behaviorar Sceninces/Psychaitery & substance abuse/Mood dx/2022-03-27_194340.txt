(Choice C) This patient's anxiety revolves around her ability to parent and is a common
feature of patients with PPD. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by pervasive
anxiety about multiple issues lasting 26 months.

(Choice D) Mild sadness and anxiety are commonly experienced by mothers in response to
the stress of taking care of a newborn (ie, postpartum blues). This normal and self-limited
response typically peaks at 5 days postpartum and resolves within 2 weeks. However, this
patient's symptoms have persisted beyond 2 weeks and are sufficient in number and severity
to diagnose major depression.

Educational objective:

Postpartum depression is diagnosed using the same diagnostic criteria used for major
depressive episodes that occur outside the postpartum period. It should be differentiated from
postpartum blues, which is a milder and self-limited form of depression that peaks at 5 days
and resolves within 2 weeks.
