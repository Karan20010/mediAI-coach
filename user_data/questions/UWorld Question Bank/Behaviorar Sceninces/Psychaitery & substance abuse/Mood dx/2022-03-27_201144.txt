(Choices B and C) Social isolation and insomnia are common symptoms of major depression
that occur in patients with and without suicidality. Although they increase the risk for suicide,
they are not as critical as this patient's active suicidal ideation and preparations.

(Choice E) Although suicide risk increases in patients who have lost a loved one, this is not
as strong a risk factor as having active suicidal ideation with a plan.

Educational objective:

Patients with suicidal thoughts should be assessed for intent and plan. Patients with active
suicidal ideation and intent who have made preparations to carry out a specific method of
suicide are at highest risk.
