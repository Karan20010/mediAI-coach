This patient's severely depressed mood, low energy, sleep and appetite disturbances, weight
loss, suicidal ideation, and auditory hallucinations are consistent with major depressive
disorder with psychotic features. First-line treatment of psychotic depression consists of
either the combination of an antidepressant and antipsychotic or electroconvulsive therapy
(ECT).

ECT uses a small electric current to produce a generalized tonic-clonic seizure under
anesthesia. Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, ECT is a safe and effective
treatment that achieves a more rapid response than pharmacotherapy in severely depressed
patients who are suicidal or psychotic.

(Choice A) Antipsychotic therapy is used in the treatment of psychotic disorders and bipolar
disorder. Antipsychotics can also be used in combination with antidepressants to treat major
depression with psychotic features, but the response is generally slower compared with ECT.

(Choice C) Lithium is a mood stabilizer used primarily in bipolar disorder.

(Choices D, F, and G) Antidepressants do not work as fast as ECT and may take up to 6
weeks for response. They also must be combined with an antipsychotic medication to
effectively treat major depression with psychotic features.
