A 40-year-old woman comes to the office due to lesions on her left arm. She developed small,
red sores a few weeks ago, and over the past few days, they have increased in number. The
patient is very concerned that they will cause an infection because she has had similar lesions
on her extremities many times in the past; wound cultures have consistently grown Escherichia
coli. Most recently, she developed cellulitis 8 months ago and required intravenous

antibiotics. The patient says, "| don't know why my skin keeps getting infected. I've been to so
many doctors, and none of them can tell me what's going on." She lives alone and works as a
traveling nurse. Medical history is otherwise noncontributory. Which of the following is most
characteristic of this patient's condition?

A. Fear of humiliation and rejection by others (2%)
B. Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment (3%)
Y%_ C. Intentional self-injury to induce illness (58%)
D. Persistently high level of anxiety about health (32%)
