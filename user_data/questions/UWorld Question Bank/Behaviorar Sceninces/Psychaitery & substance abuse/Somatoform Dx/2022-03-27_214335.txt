Although transient experiences of depersonalization and derealization are common in the
general population, this patient's persistent and recurrent episodes are consistent with
depersonalization/derealization disorder. It is classified as one of the dissociative disorders
and should be differentiated from dissociative amnesia and dissociative identity disorder.

Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of detachment or
estrangement from the self or a sense of being an outside observer of the self. Derealization
is a subjective sense of detachment or unreality regarding surroundings. In contrast to
psychotic disorders, reality testing is intact during these unusual experiences (ie, individuals
may feel detached from their bodies but know this is not true).

(Choice A) Absence seizures typically begin in childhood and are frequently associated with
staring, repetitive eyelid movements, automatisms, and lack of awareness of the episodes.

(Choice B) This patient's intact reality testing and absence of psychotic symptoms (eg,
delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior) make brief psychotic disorder
unlikely.

(Choices D and E) Dissociative amnesia involves gaps in autobiographical memory, usually
associated with a traumatic event. Dissociative identity disorder is a rare condition associated

with severe trauma that involves fragmentation of identity into 22 distinct personality states.
