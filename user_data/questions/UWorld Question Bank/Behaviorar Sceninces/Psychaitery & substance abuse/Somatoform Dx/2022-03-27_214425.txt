(Choice B) Frantic efforts to avoid abandonment is a characteristic feature of borderline
personality disorder (BPD). Although deliberate self-harm can be seen in both BPD and
factitious disorder, this patient engages in self-injurious behavior with the intention to deceive
others, not to express anger and frustration in response to unstable relationships and affective
reactivity, as seen in BPD.

(Choice D) A persistently high level of health anxiety is a core symptom of illness anxiety
disorder, which can also lead to high health care utilization in these patients who repeatedly
seek reassurance about a feared illness. However, this patient does not fear illness but rather
has intentionally induced her illness with the goal of assuming the patient role.

(Choice E) A preoccupation with an inability to function independently is a feature of
dependent personality disorder. Although both factitious disorder and dependent personality
disorder are characterized by a desire to be cared for by others, patients with factitious
disorder intentionally fabricate symptoms to achieve this goal.

Educational objective:
Factitious disorder is characterized by the intentional falsification of symptoms or induction of
illness. In factitious disorder, the goal is to assume the patient role, and there is no obvious

external reward
