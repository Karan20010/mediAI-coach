This patient's indirect expression of anger about having to wait for the physician is an
example of passive aggression. Rather than directly expressing his feelings, he agrees to fill
out the forms and then resists performing the expected task. Other examples of behaviors
used to indirectly defuse hostile feelings include procrastination, forgetfulness, and purposeful
inefficiency. Backhanded compliments, sarcasm, and denial of being angry are also
characteristic of passive-aggressive behavior.

(Choice A) Acting out is an immature defense mechanism that involves expressing
unconscious wishes or impulses through overtly aggressive actions (eg, the patient tore up the
forms in anger).

(Choice B) In displacement, negative feelings associated with a person or situation are
transferred to another person or object that appears less threatening (eg, the patient did not
express his anger to the physician but yelled at his wife instead).

(Choice D) In reaction formation, unacceptable feelings are transformed into their opposites
(eg, the patient's irritation was redirected into being overly complimentary to the physician).

(Choice E) Splitting involves experiencing the self or others in extremes, either all positive or
all negative (eg, the patient was told of the delay in his appointment time and then perceived

the physician as horrible with no redeeming qualities).
