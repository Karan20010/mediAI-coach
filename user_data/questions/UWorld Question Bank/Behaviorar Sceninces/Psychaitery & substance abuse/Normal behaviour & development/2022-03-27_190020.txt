An 11-month-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for a well-child visit. The mother
reports that he has been crying and screaming when other people approach him. She is
concerned that it has been occurring for the past few months and that it seems to be
worsening. She says, "He used to love being held by everyone but now wants to be with only
me. He won't even let his grandma hold him anymore." The patient is crawling and can stand
only with assistance. He babbles but does not say any clear words and uses hand gestures to
communicate. Growth curves are tracking adequately. On physical examination, the patient
clings to his mother and begins crying, turning his head away from the physician when he
attempts to interact with him. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this
patient's behavior?

©) A. Adjustment disorder with anxiety
©) B. Autism spectrum disorder
(©) C. Normal development
