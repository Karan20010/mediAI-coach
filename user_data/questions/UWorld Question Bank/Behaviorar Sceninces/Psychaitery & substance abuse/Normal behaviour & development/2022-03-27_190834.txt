The resident's response to the patient is illustrative of countertransference, which consists of
the physician or therapist's conscious and unconscious reaction toward a patient (eg,
attitudes, thoughts, feelings, behaviors) that is based on past personal relationships.
Countertransference reactions can be positive (eg, physician takes extra time with a patient
who resembles a beloved grandmother) or negative (eg, physician avoids a patient who
resembles a critical parent).

Countertransference can interfere with medical judgment. In this case, the resident's
negative emotions toward her father are activated when the patient dismisses her training and
credentials. The resident acts on her negative countertransference reaction and adopts an
inappropriately authoritarian approach by terminating the conversation and ordering a
medication. Awareness of countertransference may prevent responses and behaviors (eg,
yelling at a patient, ordering unnecessary medications/restraints, cutting an interview short)
that could be harmful to patient care.

(Choice B) Passive aggression is a defense mechanism in which anger is expressed in a
nonconfrontational manner. Examples of passive aggressive behaviors include sarcasm,
procrastination, and purposeful inefficiency.
