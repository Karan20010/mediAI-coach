(Choice B) In displacement, negative feelings associated with a person or situation are
transferred to a less threatening object or person (eg, if this patient said the nurse was

"terrible" and unresponsive to her needs when in fact it is how she feels about the surgeon).

(Choice C) Passive aggression involves expressing hostility indirectly in an unassertive way
(eg, if this patient expressed her anger by remaining noncommunicative during the discharge
process or deliberately neglected to sign her discharge papers).

(Choice D) In projection, one's own unacceptable thoughts or feelings are perceived as
coming from someone else (eg, if this patient on the day of discharge felt that the surgeon was
angry with her).

(Choice E) Reaction formation is the redirection of an unacceptable impulse into its opposite
(eg, if this patient sent the physician a thank-you note and lavish gift instead of expressing her
anger).
