(Choice D) Persistent complex bereavement disorder (also Known as complicated grief) is
characterized by prolonged grief for >12 months, difficulty accepting the death, persistent
yearning for the deceased, and inability to reengage with life. This patient's symptom duration
is within the range seen in normal grief and she is showing signs of adapting to living without
the deceased.

(Choice E) Persistent depressive disorder is a chronic depression that persists for at least 2
years.

(Choice F) Although this patient witnessed her husband's accident and avoids cycling, her
symptoms are not consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder as she is not re-experiencing
the event (eg, nightmares, flashbacks) or having symptoms of trauma-related reactivity (eg,
hypervigilance, heightened startle response).

Educational objective:
Normal grief presents with symptoms similar to those of a major depressive episode.

However, in normal grief, pervasive anhedonia, worthlessness, and suicidality are not present.
