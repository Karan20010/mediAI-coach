Developmental milestones during toddlerhood must be thoroughly assessed by practitioners
during routine well-child examinations. Milestones are divided into categories, including
cognitive/academic, gross motor control, fine motor control, social behavior, and language.
Because each child is different, milestones should be used as a guideline. For instance, one
child may be able to kick a ball at 18 months and another at 24 months. A child who is
deficient in a single task is unlikely to have developmental delay, but failure to reach several
milestones by the appropriate age, or a marked delay in one area, requires further evaluation.

Three-year-olds should have the fine motor skills to copy a circle and use utensils; this
patient has not reached his expected fine motor milestones and should undergo additional

evaluation.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) This patient's cognitive, gross motor, language, and social
development are within the expected range. By age 3, children are expected to describe their
age and gender and follow simple directions (cognitive). They are able to climb stairs with
alternating feet and ride a tricycle by operating the pedals (gross motor) and speak in simple
sentences (language). In addition, 3-year-olds engage in imaginative play and play in parallel
but not cooperatively with others (social). Toilet training often begins at age 2 or 3.
