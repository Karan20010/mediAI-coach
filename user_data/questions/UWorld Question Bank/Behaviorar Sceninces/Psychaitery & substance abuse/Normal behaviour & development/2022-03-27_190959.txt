Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which an individual transforms
unacceptable feelings or impulses into their extreme opposites. This woman does not want
to be a stepmother, and her resentment toward the child is masked with declarations of love.
Her negative feelings toward the child are transformed into oversolicitous behavior in response
to his tripping and excessive preparations for his birthday party.

(Choice A) Displacement is the inappropriate transfer of feelings or impulses toward a less
threatening object (eg, if this woman yelled at her dog instead of the child).

(Choice B) Projection involves attributing unacceptable impulses or behavior to another
person or situation (eg, if this woman accused her husband of disliking the child).

(Choice C) In rationalization, an individual makes excuses for unacceptable feelings or
behavior (eg, if this woman explained that she is much too old to be caring for a young child).

(Choice E) Splitting is an immature defense mechanism in which an individual is unable to
integrate mixed feelings (eg, if this woman alternately felt the boy was "all bad" and "all
good"). It is commonly seen in borderline personality disorder.

(Choice F) Suppression is the voluntary withholding of unpleasant thoughts or feelings from
one's mind in order to cope with reality (eg, if this woman acknowledged her resentment

toward the child but chose to put it aside for the sake of her marriage).
