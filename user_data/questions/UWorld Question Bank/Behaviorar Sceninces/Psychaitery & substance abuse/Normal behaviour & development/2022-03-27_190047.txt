(Choice E) Separation anxiety disorder is diagnosed in children who exhibit persistent and
disabling anxiety about losing attachment figures at separation. It usually develops in
childhood rather than infancy, typically in association with starting school. Stranger anxiety, in
contrast to separation anxiety, occurs even when the caregiver is present.
