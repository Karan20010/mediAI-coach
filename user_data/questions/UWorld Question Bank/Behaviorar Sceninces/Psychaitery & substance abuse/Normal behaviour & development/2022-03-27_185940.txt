A 14-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for a 6-month checkup for asthma.
Although the patient's asthma is generally well controlled with long-acting agents, he has
episodes of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction for which he was prescribed a short-acting
beta agonist. His mother became concerned after the physical education teacher called from
school saying that her son was refusing to participate in class. When asked about this, the
patient said that it was easier to avoid exercising than to use an inhaler at school. Family
history is significant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in his maternal
grandfather, heart disease in his father, and generalized anxiety disorder in his mother. Vital
signs and physical examination are within normal limits. Which of the following factors would
most likely increase this patient's adherence with bronchodilator administration?

©) A. Receiving education about the association between asthma and COPD
©) B. Receiving online resources about successful athletes who have asthma

©) C. Receiving counsel from the physician that inhaler use before exercise prevents
asthma symptoms

©) D. Receiving written material about the benefits of exercise in long-term asthma
