Question Id: 15242

A resident physician is finishing up her shift when she receives a page that reads, "Patient in
Room 121 asking to leave." The patient was admitted 2 hours ago for worsening dyspnea.

On entering the room, the resident attempts to engage in a discussion about why the patient is
requesting to leave. In response, the patient pulls out his nasal cannula and breathlessly says,
"You don't know anything; you're not even a real doctor!" The resident is reminded of her
father, who has frequently belittled her accomplishments. She angrily informs the patient, "You
can't leave and I'm ordering haloperidol to calm you down." Which of the following best

explains the resident's response to the patient?
