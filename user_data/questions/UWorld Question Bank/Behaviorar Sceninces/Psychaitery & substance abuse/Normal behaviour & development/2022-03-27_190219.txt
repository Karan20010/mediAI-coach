folding it in half, and placing it on the floor. Due to the brevity of these actions, attention and

concentration may not be tested effectively.
(Choice B) Memory registration and recall are assessed by asking the patient to repeat aloud
the names of 3 unrelated objects and then asking him/her to recall them several minutes later.

This would not test attention and concentration effectively, as these are better assessed by
tasks requiring prolonged, continuous thinking.

(Choice D) Remote memory is tested by asking patients about the details of significant life
events (eg, birth, graduation, marriage dates).

(Choice E) The writing domain of language can be tested by asking the patient to write a
sentence containing at least one noun and verb. Oral fluency can be assessed by listening to
the patient's spontaneous speech.

Educational objective:

Quick clinical tests to assess attention and concentration include counting down from 100 by
intervals of 3 or 7, reciting the months of the year in reverse order, and spelling "world"
backwards.
