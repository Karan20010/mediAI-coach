(Choice B) In displacement, a person expresses unacceptable feelings intended for one
person to a more neutral person or object (eg, if this patient did not express his anger to his
father and instead berated the psychiatrist). Because the patient disclosed his anger to his
father directly, he would not be using displacement.

(Choice C) Projection involves misattributing one's own unacceptable feelings to another
person (eg, if the patient were unable to acknowledge his disappointment toward his
psychiatrist about canceling and instead perceived his psychiatrist as being upset with him).

(Choice D) In reaction formation, uncomfortable feelings are transformed into their opposites
(eg, if this patient expressed deep appreciation for the psychiatrist's care rather than
acknowledging his disappointment).

(Choice E) Regression is a defense mechanism in which an individual returns to an earlier
level of functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, if the patient sulked and refused to
speak rather than maturely discussing his feelings with the psychiatrist).

Educational objective:
Transference is the unconscious shifting of emotions associated with a significant person from
one's past to a person in the present.
