Bereavement reactions in children depend on the child's age. Preschool children (age <6)
may not understand the finality of death and can exhibit magical thinking in which they
fully expect that a dead person can come back to life. Younger children may also attribute
events or other's reactions to something they did wrong due to an egocentric thought process
(eg, this child believing that he causes his mother's crying). Death should be explained to
them in concrete terms, and they should be reassured that other people's grief is not their

fault.

(Choice B) This child's reactions are age-appropriate. Complicated grief (also known as
persistent complex bereavement disorder) is characterized by prolonged grief, excessive
yearning for the deceased, and inability to move on with life.

(Choice C) This boy's behavior (not understanding death) is appropriate for a 5-year-old; in
contrast, children age 27 are typically aware that death is final.

(Choice D) Post-traumatic stress disorder requires exposure to a life-threatening event that
continues to be reexperienced in the form of flashbacks and nightmares. In preschool children
this can be manifested by repetitive play about the event, frightening nightmares, and mood or

behavioral changes (eg, temper tantrums, separation anxiety).
