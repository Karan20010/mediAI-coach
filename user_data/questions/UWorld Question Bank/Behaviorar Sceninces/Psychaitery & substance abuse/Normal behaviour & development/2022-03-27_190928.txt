Question Id: 1729

This patient's response to her roommate's stethoscope is an example of classical
conditioning. Childhood encounters with her primary care physician for ear infections
(unconditioned stimulus) caused anxiety (an automatic reaction called an unconditioned
response), resulting in sweating at subsequent health care visits. The encounters with her
physician are most likely associated with the presence of a stethoscope (the conditioned
stimulus). Repeated pairing of the unconditioned stimulus (eg, physician encounter) with the
conditioned stimulus (eg, stethoscope) allows the conditioned stimulus alone to elicit a
learned, conditioned response (eg, sweating).

Classical conditioning provides one explanation for "white coat hypertension," a condition in
which a physician's white coat or examination room acts as a conditioned stimulus, causing
anxiety and transient blood pressure elevation during health care visits.

(Choices B, C, and D) In operant conditioning, rewards and punishments are used to
reinforce behavior. Negative punishment is the removal of a reward to decrease a behavior
(eg, a teenager's driving privileges are taken away after returning home past curfew). With
negative reinforcement, desired behavior is strengthened through the removal of a negative
outcome (eg, suffering a bad sunburn promotes application of sunscreen to prevent future
sunburns).
