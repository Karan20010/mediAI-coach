(Choices A and B) Most primary thought disorders (eg, schizophrenia, schizoaffective
disorder) are chronic, insidious disorders with a gradual onset (prodrome) of weeks to months.
In contrast, the presence of sudden onset of symptoms from a precipitating event suggests an
underlying cause that may allow for treatment and symptom improvement when the precipitant
is addressed.

(Choice C) Although unclear, possible reasons for poorer outcomes in men include biological
(ie, genetic influences, changes in brain structure, hormones) and psychosocial (ie, social
support deficits, substance use, vocational pressures/expectations) differences.

(Choice D) Patients with childhood or adolescent onset typically have a more severe form of
the illness and a worse prognosis; the early onset may be due to a neurodevelopmental
process with a deteriorating course.

Educational objective:

Favorable prognostic factors in schizophrenia include predominantly positive psychotic
symptoms, acute onset (shorter prodrome) with an identifiable precipitant, and older age at
onset.
