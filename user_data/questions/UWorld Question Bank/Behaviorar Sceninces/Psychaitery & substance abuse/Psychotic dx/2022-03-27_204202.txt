The misuse of stimulants by college students to enhance academic performance is prevalent.
This patient's acute onset of paranoia, restlessness, and hypervigilance, and physical signs of
mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis, are most likely due to stimulant
intoxication. Transient paranoid psychosis can develop in intoxication with all major
stimulants, including prescription medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (eg,
amphetamines, methylphenidate). Substance-induced psychotic disorder is diagnosed
when stimulant intoxication presents with prominent psychotic symptoms.

Substance-induced psychotic disorders must be differentiated from primary psychiatric
disorders such as bipolar manic episodes and psychotic disorders. This student's prominent
physical signs and lack of psychiatric history, combined with the temporal association between
staying up to study and acute onset of psychosis, make a stimulant-induced psychotic disorder
more likely.

(Choice A) Patients experiencing a bipolar manic episode can also have decreased sleep,
pressured speech, physical restlessness, and psychotic features. However, the temporal
association of studying for exams and the patient's abnormal vital signs, mydriasis, and
diaphoresis make substance intoxication more likely.
