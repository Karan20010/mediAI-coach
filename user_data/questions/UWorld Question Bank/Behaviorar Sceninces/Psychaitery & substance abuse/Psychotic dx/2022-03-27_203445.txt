premorbid functioning. A diagnosis of schizophrenia requires symptom duration of 26 months.

(Choice C) In delusional disorder, other psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, disorganized
speech and behavior) are not present, behavior is not obviously bizarre, and functioning is not
markedly impaired apart from the impact of the delusion.

(Choice D) There are insufficient symptoms to diagnose a major depressive episode. This
patient's social withdrawal is a negative symptom characteristic of psychosis, and his appetite
disturbance is due to the paranoid delusions about food being poisoned.

Educational objective:
Schizophreniform disorder is characterized by psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech and behavior, negative symptoms) lasting 21 month and <6 months.
