Question Id: 106670

(Choice A) Fixation on date and time as having special meaning is a referential delusion (ie, a
belief that cues from the environment are individualized messages). Patients with delusional
disorders typically do not have referential delusions, negative symptoms, or disorganized
speech.

(Choice B) Response to a significant loss may include withdrawal, apathy, flat affect or
preoccupation with memories of the deceased. However, normal bereavement does not cause
disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, or delusions.

(Choice C) Behaviors related to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), such as ritualistic
washing or chewing food a certain number of times, can appear bizarre. However, bizarre,
indecipherable speech; negative symptoms; and referential delusions are not associated with
OCD.

(Choice D) Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) involves psychological distress following a
traumatic event. It can present with distress-related disturbances resembling hallucinations
and/or mood alterations with anhedonia and negative emotionality. However, the levels of
disorganized, incoherent speech and thought in this patient are not seen in PTSD.
