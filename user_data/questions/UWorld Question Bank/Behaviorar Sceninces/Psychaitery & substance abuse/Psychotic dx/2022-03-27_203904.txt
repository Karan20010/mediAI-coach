symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization, negative symptoms) lasting =
months.

(Choice C) Friedreich ataxia, the most common hereditary ataxia, is characterized by
neurologic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and diabetes mellitus.

(Choices E and G) Although this patient has both mood and psychotic symptoms, they are
more likely manifestations of HD given his movement abnormalities. In major depression with
psychotic features, psychosis occurs exclusively during the depression. In schizoaffective
disorder, patients show evidence of psychosis when they are not depressed.

(Choice F) Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized
by tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Psychosis can also occur in PD but typically presents
later in the disease course. PD is less likely in this patient with early psychiatric findings,
choreiform movements, and absence of other neurological findings of PD (eg, tremor,
bradykinesia).
