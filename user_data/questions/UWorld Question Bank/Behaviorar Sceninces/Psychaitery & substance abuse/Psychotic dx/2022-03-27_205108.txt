Schizophrenia presents with a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional disturbances
and typically has an onset in early adulthood (peak age: men, early 20s; women, late 20s).

Schizophrenia has a gradual onset but occasionally a precipitating stressor unmasks the
disorder, such as in this patient with symptoms after the death of his father.

The diagnosis is made with continuous signs of disturbance for at least 6 months, including at
least 1 month of 22 of the following active symptoms (with at least 1 from the first 3):

¢ Delusions (eg, fixation on a date and time, thinking that it has special meaning)

¢ Hallucinations

¢ Disorganized speech (eg, frequent change of topics, random remarks)

¢ Disorganized/catatonic behavior (eg, bizarre drawings)

¢ Negative symptoms (eg, apathy, flat affect, social withdrawal, lack of speech, anhedonia)

Although positive symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations) are characteristic in
schizophrenia, some patients, such as this one, demonstrate largely negative symptoms with
increasing social withdrawal (eg, not responding to friends), apathy (eg, not completing
homework assignments), and affective blunting. Treatment is with antipsychotics (eg,
risperidone, olanzapine). However, these drugs are more effective at managing positive

symptoms; negative symptoms are typically refractory to intervention.
