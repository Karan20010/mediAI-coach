Question Id: 15254

A 22-year-old man is brought to the office by his mother due to a change in behavior over the
past year. Nine months ago, the patient abruptly decided to quit college in his last year and
insisted on moving back home to "work on my research without being disturbed." Since then,
he has stopped going out with friends, seems uninterested in his usual hobbies of playing and
watching football, and spends hours on his computer researching government cover-ups. He
stays up late at night, sleeps during the day, and showers only once a week. The patient has
no motivation to look for work; his mother reports that when she encourages him to go back to
school or work, he becomes agitated and starts accusing her of "being one of the black suits."
Physical examination shows poor hygiene but is otherwise normal. Laboratory evaluation,
including urine drug screen, is unremarkable. A medication with which of the following primary

mechanisms of action is most appropriate for this patient's condition?

©) A. Alpha receptor agonism
(©) B. Dopamine receptor antagonism
(©) C. Dopamine reuptake inhibition

(©) D. Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonism
