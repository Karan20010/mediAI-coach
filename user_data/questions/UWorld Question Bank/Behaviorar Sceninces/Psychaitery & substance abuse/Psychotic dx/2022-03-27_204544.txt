(Choice D) Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by infertility, oligomenorrhea, and
hyperandrogenism. It typically begins in adolescence and is unlikely to develop in a 38-year-
old woman. Most patients with polycystic ovary syndrome are obese. Insulin resistance is
thought to play a central role in its pathogenesis.

(Choice E) Primary ovarian insufficiency is characterized by amenorrhea, hypoestrogenism,
and elevated serum gonadotropin levels in women age <40. The decreased estrogenic effect
on breast tissue can cause a decline in breast density but would not cause tenderness.

(Choice F) Severe weight loss (eg, anorexia nervosa), intense exercise, and/or severe stress
can cause amenorrhea by inducing functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. However, none of
these would cause breast tenderness.

Educational objective:

The secretion of prolactin is controlled by the inhibitory effect of hypothalamic dopamine.
Risperidone and other antipsychotics cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking D2 receptors on
lactotrophs. Elevated prolactin leads to amenorrhea (inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing
hormone release), galactorrhea, and breast soreness.
