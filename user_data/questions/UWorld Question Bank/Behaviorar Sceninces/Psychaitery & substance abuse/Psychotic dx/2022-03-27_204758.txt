Olanzapine is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used to treat psychotic
and mood disorders. SGAs are commonly used as first-line agents due to their lower risk of
extrapyramidal side effects compared to first-generation antipsychotics. As a class, SGAs are
associated with metabolic adverse effects (eg, weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia,
increased risk of diabetes) to varying degrees. Among the SGAs, olanzapine and clozapine
carry the greatest metabolic syndrome risk. Patients taking SGAs require routine
monitoring of metabolic parameters, including weight, waist circumference, blood pressure,
fasting glucose, and lipid profile.

(Choices A and F) Blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and thyroid function tests should be
routinely monitored in patients taking the mood stabilizer lithium due to its potential to cause
hypothyroidism and impair renal function. Treatment with olanzapine does not require routine
monitoring of thyroid or renal function.

(Choice B) Olanzapine rarely causes neutropenia, and routine monitoring of complete blood
counts is not required unless the patient has a history of drug-induced or baseline
neutropenia. Clozapine is the only antipsychotic that requires regular monitoring of the

absolute neutrophil count due to the drug's 1% risk of agranulocytosis.

(Choice C) Routine ECG monitoring is not required with antipsychotic treatment unless the
