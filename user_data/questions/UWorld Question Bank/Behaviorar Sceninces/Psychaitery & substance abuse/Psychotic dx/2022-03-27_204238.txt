Antipsychotic medications are first-line pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia. The primary
mechanism of action of antipsychotics is antagonism at postsynaptic dopamine D2
receptors. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have the additional property of

receptor partial agonists.

(Choice A) Alpha receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of a variety of medications
(eg, vasopressors, nasal decongestants), but it does not play a role in the therapeutic action of
antipsychotics.

(Choices C and F) Dopamine reuptake inhibition, usually in combination with norepinephrine
