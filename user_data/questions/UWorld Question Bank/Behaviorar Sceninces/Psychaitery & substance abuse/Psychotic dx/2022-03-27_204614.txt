Question Id: 15416

This patient is experiencing an acute psychotic episode (delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized behavior) most likely due to schizophrenia, a chronic psychotic illness with typical
onset in young adulthood. His treatment history indicates a good response to the first-
generation antipsychotic (FGA) haloperidol but poor adherence, likely because of tolerability
issues. As a class, FGAs are associated with a high risk of extrapyramidal symptoms
(EPSs) due to their potent D2 antagonism. Types of EPS effects include acute dystonic
reactions, drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia (inner restlessness and inability to sit still),
and tardive dyskinesia.

Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are often used for first-line treatment in
schizophrenia due to their lower risk of EPSs compared with FGAs. However, SGAs are
associated with weight gain and metabolic effects, including the development of diabetes.
Side effect profiles of individual SGAs vary; olanzapine and clozapine are associated with the

greatest risk of metabolic effects.

(Choice A) FGAs and SGAs appear to be equally effective in the treatment of positive
psychotic symptoms.

(Choice B) Both FGAs and SGAs block muscarinic receptors to varying degrees. Low-
potency FGAs (eg, chlorpromazine) and the SGAs olanzapine, quetiapine, and clozapine have
