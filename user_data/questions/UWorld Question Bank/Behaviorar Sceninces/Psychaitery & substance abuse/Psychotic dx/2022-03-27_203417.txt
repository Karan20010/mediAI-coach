An 18-year-old man is brought to the clinic by his mother due to increasingly bizarre behavior
over the past 2 months. The patient is in his first semester at an out-of-state college and has
had difficulty adjusting to being away from home. For the past few weeks, he has not been
attending classes, and he no longer socializes with friends. The patient spends most of his
time alone in his dorm room and eats very little because he believes the cafeteria food is
poisoned. He has no significant medical or psychiatric history and does not use alcohol or
illicit drugs. Physical examination is unremarkable. On mental status examination, he appears
disheveled with unwashed hair, makes poor eye contact, and shouts "leave me alone" in
response to unseen people. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

(©) A. Adjustment disorder

©) B. Brief psychotic disorder

|) C. Delusional disorder

©) D. Major depressive disorder with psychotic features
©) E. Schizophrenia

(©) F. Schizophreniform disorder
