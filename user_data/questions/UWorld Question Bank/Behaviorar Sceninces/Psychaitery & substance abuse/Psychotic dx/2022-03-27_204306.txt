Question Id: 516

The second-generation antipsychotic clozapine is the only antipsychotic that has consistently
shown superior efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and schizophrenia associated
with persistent suicidality. Clozapine has affinity for multiple dopamine and serotonin
receptors, but the precise pharmacological mechanism responsible for its superior efficacy is
unknown. Clozapine binds loosely and transiently to dopamine D2 receptors, causing
significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms compared to first-generation antipsychotics.

Neutropenia (<1000 cells/mm*) and the potential for life-threatening agranulocytosis are the
major adverse effects of clozapine. The risk of agranulocytosis is approximately 1%;
therefore, treatment requires regular monitoring of the patient's absolute neutrophil count.
Treatment should be stopped if neutropenia occurs. Seizures and myocarditis are other
important adverse effects that require provider vigilance.

(Choice B) Clozapine plasma levels can be checked after an initial target dose is reached,
but further dosage adjustments are usually based on clinical response. Clozapine levels are
not regularly monitored.

(Choices C and H) Creatinine levels and thyroid function tests should be monitored in
patients taking lithium due to this drug's potential to adversely affect thyroid and renal function.
