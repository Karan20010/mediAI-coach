(Choice A) The arcuate fasciculus is a neural pathway that connects the Broca and Wernicke
areas, which are responsible for expressive and receptive language, respectively. Disruption
of the arcuate fasciculus classically results in conduction aphasia, characterized by fluent
speech, intact comprehension, and impaired repetition.

(Choice B) The hypothalamospinal tract projects from the hypothalamus to the ciliospinal
center of the intermediolateral cell column (T1-L2), providing sympathetic innervation to the
ipsilateral eye and face. Disruption of this tract typically results in ipsilateral Horner syndrome
(eg, ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis).

(Choice C) The lateral medullary spinothalamic tract transmits pain and temperature signals
from the contralateral body to the thalamus. Lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg
syndrome) presents with loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral body and
ipsilateral face as well as vertigo, hoarseness, dysphagia, and abnormal eye movements.

(Choice D) The therapeutic effect of antipsychotics arises from blockade D2 receptors in the
mesolimbic pathway.
(Choice E) The nigrostriatal pathway projects from the substantia nigra to the caudate

nucleus and putamen and primarily regulates the coordination of voluntary movements. D2
receptor blockade in this pathway results in extrapyramidal effects (eg, dystonia, akathisia,
