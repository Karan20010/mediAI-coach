A 36-year-old man is brought to the hospital after being found wandering the streets barefoot
and shouting to himself. Although he takes antipsychotic medication daily, his parents are
having difficulty managing him at home. The patient believes he is fighting a conspiracy and
that his thoughts are directly controlled by a device that was implanted in his brain during a
prior hospitalization. Previous trials of haloperidol, quetiapine, and risperidone resulted in
minimal improvement. He has no other medical problems. On mental status examination, the
patient is alert, and restless with poor grooming, disheveled clothing, and flat affect. He
refuses to answer most questions, accuses his parents of being part of the conspiracy, and
mumbles nonsensical words. Which of the following medications would be most effective for
this patient's illness?

©) A. Aripiprazole

©) B. Chlorpromazine
©) C. Clonazepam
©) D. Clozapine

©) E. Haloperidol long-acting injectable
