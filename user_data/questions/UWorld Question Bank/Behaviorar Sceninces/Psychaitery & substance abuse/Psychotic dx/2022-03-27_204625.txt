A 45-year-old man comes to the office due to chronic insomnia. The patient has trouble
sleeping because he claims he must remain alert to protect himself from workers at a nearby
chemical plant. He says they are poisoning him by secretly dumping toxic waste in his
backyard at night. The patient's wife says, "He's been like this for the past 10 years. He gets
very upset when asked for proof, so he's going to install cameras next week." She has never
seen any unusual activity in the backyard and says that her husband has never received an
actual threat or endured actual harm. He has ordered numerous soil toxicity tests over the
years, all of which have been negative. The patient started working as a taxi driver at age 21
and continues to work for the same company. He has no history of psychiatric treatment.
