Question Id: 15397

This patient developed an acute dystonic reaction (a type of extrapyramidal symptom [EPS])
several days after exposure to the first-generation antipsychotic (FGA) haloperidol. FGAs
have a high risk of causing EPS due to their potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonism.
Management of an acute dystonic reaction includes treatment with diphenhydramine or
benztropine and switching to an agent with a lower propensity for producing EPS, such as a

second-generation antipsychotic (SGA).

In addition to dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, SGAs (eg, olanzapine, quetiapine) also
block serotonin receptors, specifically the 5-HT2A receptor. Compared with FGAs, SGAs
block 5-HT2A receptors more potently than D2 receptors and have lower binding affinity at the
dopamine receptor site, which is thought to explain the reduced risk of causing EPS. Although
SGAs have a low risk of EPS, they are associated with a greater risk of metabolic adverse
effects.

(Choice A) Dopamine reuptake inhibition, usually in combination with norepinephrine
reuptake inhibition, is the mechanism of action of many drugs used to treat ADHD (eg,
methylphenidate, bupropion).

(Choice B) Dopamine D2 partial agonism is one of the mechanisms of action of the SGAs

aripiprazole and brexpiprazole.
