diaphoresis make substance intoxication more likely.

(Choice B) Primary psychotic disorders are diagnoses of exclusion that require ruling out
substance use and medical etiologies. Brief psychotic disorder is a rare condition
characterized by acute onset of 21 psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations,
disorganized speech or behavior) lasting 21 days but <1 month, with eventual complete
resolution. This patient's physical findings (ie, mydriasis, tachycardia, hypertension,
diaphoresis), the prevalence of stimulant misuse on college campuses, and the temporal
association between intense studying and symptom onset make substance-induced psychosis
much more likely than brief psychotic disorder.

(Choices C and D) These diagnoses would not be considered at this point due to insufficient
duration of psychotic symptoms. The essential feature of delusional disorder is 21 delusions
lasting 21 months without other psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder involves 22
psychotic symptoms lasting 21 months but <6 months.

Educational objective:

Stimulant intoxication can present with paranoid ideation and must be differentiated from
primary psychiatric disorders. Physical signs of stimulant intoxication include mydriasis,
tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis.
