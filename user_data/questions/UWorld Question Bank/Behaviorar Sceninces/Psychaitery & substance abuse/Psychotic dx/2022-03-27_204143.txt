4 (Choices C and F) The benzodiazepine diazepam and the beta blocker propranolol may both
- be used in the treatment of akathisia. Akathisia is characterized by subjective restless and an
7 inability to sit still rather than rigidity and tremor, as seen in this patient.

9 (Choice D) Haloperidol is a first-generation antipsychotic and potent D2 blocker that
ou frequently causes extrapyramidal symptoms, including drug-induced parkinsonism. Its use
would only exacerbate the patient's parkinsonian symptoms. Use of a second-generation

antipsychotic with minimal D2 blockade would be a reasonable long-term alternative if the
patient were taking a first-generation antipsychotic.

Educational objective:

Drug-induced parkinsonism is an extrapyramidal side effect caused by medications that block
D2 receptors (eg, antipsychotics). Management strategies include decreasing or discontinuing
the offending medication and treatment with an anticholinergic medication.
