This patient's paranoid delusions, disorganized speech and behavior, auditory hallucinations,
and 1-year history of functional decline are consistent with schizophrenia. Symptom domains
in schizophrenia include positive symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations, disorganization) and
negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, apathy, poverty of speech, social withdrawal). On mental
status examination, flat affect is manifested by a lack of facial expression and a monotone
voice, typically accompanied by poor eye contact. Negative symptoms are less responsive to
antipsychotic medication and typically persist between acute psychotic episodes.

Although patients with schizophrenia commonly have cognitive impairments (eg, attention,
processing speed, executive functioning), they are typically oriented and do not show a
fluctuating level of consciousness that is associated with delirium (Choice C).

(Choices B and E) Euphoric mood and rapid, pressured speech are characteristic findings of
an acute manic episode in bipolar disorder. Patients with schizophrenia may have speech that
is disorganized (eg, tangential speech, derailment), but it typically is not pressured.

(Choices D and F) Although olfactory and tactile hallucinations can occur in schizophrenia,
they are uncommon and more likely to be associated with substance use or neurological
disorders. Auditory is the most common type of hallucination in schizophrenia.
