(Choice C) The monoamine oxidase enzyme normally breaks down monoamines (eg,
dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin). The class of antidepressants known as monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) block these enzymes, thereby increasing
availability of the respective monoamines.

(Choice E) Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is the mechanism of action of

serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, venlafaxine) and tricyclic

antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline).

Educational objective:

Second-generation antipsychotics block 5-HT2A receptors and have lower binding affinity at

dopamine D2 receptor sites, which is associated with a lower risk of extrapyramidal side

effects.
