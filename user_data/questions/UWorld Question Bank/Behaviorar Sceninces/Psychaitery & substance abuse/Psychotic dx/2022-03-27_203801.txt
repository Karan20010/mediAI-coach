(Choice F) Schizophreniform disorder has the same symptoms as schizophrenia (eg,
delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech and/or behavior, negative symptoms), but the
duration is 21 month and <6 months.

Educational objective:

For diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, psychosis must occur in the absence of major mood
episodes, but mood episodes must be present for a majority of this lifelong illness. In bipolar

disorder and major depression with psychotic features, psychotic symptoms occur exclusively
during mood episodes.
