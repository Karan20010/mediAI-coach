This patient's combative behavior, confusion, poor judgment, memory loss, and hallucinations,
accompanied by nystagmus and ataxia on physical examination, are consistent with
phencyclidine (PCP) intoxication. PCP is a hallucinogen that works primarily as an N-
methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, as well as a monoamine reuptake
inhibitor. PCP was originally developed as an anesthetic, but its use was discontinued due to

its adverse effects in humans.

Moderate amounts of PCP cause dissociative symptoms, including detachment and
withdrawal. At higher doses, it can induce agitation, hallucinations, and violent behavior.
Ataxia and nystagmus (both horizontal and vertical) are other distinguishing symptoms of
PCP abuse. Hospital urine toxicology screens usually test for PCP.

(Choice A) Signs and symptoms of cocaine intoxication include tachycardia, hypertension,
blurry vision, euphoria, and agitation, typically lasting <1 hour. Ischemic effects (eg,
myocardial infarction, stroke) can occur due to severe vasoconstriction.

(Choice B) The benzodiazepine diazepam is a central nervous system depressant that
produces mild euphoria and relaxation and has significant abuse potential. Intoxication can
cause mild amnesia, sedation, slurred speech, respiratory depression, hypotension, and

bradycardia.
