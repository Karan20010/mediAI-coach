(Choice G) Catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) is found in the brain and liver and
degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters. Entacapone and tolcapone are COMT inhibitors
used to prolong the effects of levodopa treatment in patients with Parkinson disease.

Educational objective:

Cocaine is a stimulant that inhibits the presynaptic reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and
serotonin. Intoxicated patients develop agitation, tachycardia, hypertension, and light-
responsive mydriasis due to increased sympathetic activity. Cocaine is also a potent
vasoconstrictor that can cause myocardial ischemia and atrophy of the nasal mucosa and
septum.
