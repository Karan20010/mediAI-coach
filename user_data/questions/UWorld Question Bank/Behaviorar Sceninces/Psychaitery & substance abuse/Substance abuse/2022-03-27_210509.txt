This patient's depression, fatigue, hypersomnia, hyperphagia, and vivid dreams are
characteristic of cocaine withdrawal. Symptoms occur within hours to days of cessation or
reduction of heavy or prolonged use. Following a binge, patients may experience a period of
acute, intense symptoms, including severe depression with suicidal ideation, pronounced
lassitude (the "crash"), and drug cravings. In contrast to withdrawal from opiates, alcohol, and
benzodiazepines, withdrawal from cocaine and other stimulants usually results in minor
physical symptoms. No medication has proven to be effective in treating cocaine withdrawal,
and treatment is supportive only.

(Choice A) Alcohol withdrawal is a medically serious syndrome characterized by initial
symptoms of agitation, tremors, tachycardia, and hypertension (12-24 hours), with some
patients progressing to seizures and delirium tremens.

(Choice B) Symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal include anxiety, insomnia, perceptual
disturbances, tachycardia, seizures, and psychosis.

(Choice C) Patients who cease heavy and prolonged cannabis use may have irritability,
anxiety, depressed mood, insomnia, restlessness, and decreased appetite. Nonspecific
physical symptoms such as muscle aches may also be present.
