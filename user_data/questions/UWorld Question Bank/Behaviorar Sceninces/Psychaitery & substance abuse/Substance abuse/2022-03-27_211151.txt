This patient's presentation is consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal (eg, lorazepam),
which is most often characterized by rebound anxiety, tremor, insomnia, and sympathetic
hyperactivity (eg, diaphoresis, palpitations). In severe cases, psychotic symptoms (eg,
hallucinations, delusions), seizures, and even death may occur. Risk of withdrawal is
greatest with short-acting agents (eg, alprazolam), prolonged use, and use of higher doses.

Benzodiazepines act on the GABA, receptor, enhancing the action of the natural ligand,
GABA. The body adapts to chronic benzodiazepine exposure by downregulating the GABA,
receptor, leading to tolerance, a phenomenon in which the same dose of a medication yields
decreasing effects over time. This same adaptive downregulation process is responsible for
the withdrawal syndrome when benzodiazepines are discontinued and the body is unable to
balance opposing excitatory neurotransmitters. Benzodiazepine withdrawal is treated by
starting a patient on a long-acting benzodiazepine (eg, diazepam) and planning for an
extended, gradual taper.

(Choices A and G) The anticonvulsants lamotrigine and valproate are used in bipolar
disorder for their mood-stabilizing properties. Withdrawal from these medications would not

produce seizures in a patient without an underlying seizure disorder.
