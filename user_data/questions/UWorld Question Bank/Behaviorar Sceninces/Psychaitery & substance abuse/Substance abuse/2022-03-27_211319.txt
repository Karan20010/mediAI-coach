In addition to psychosocial interventions (eg, motivational interviewing, Alcoholics
Anonymous), several medications are available to treat alcohol use disorder, including
naltrexone and acamprosate. Naltrexone blocks the mu-opioid receptor and inhibits the
rewarding and reinforcing effects of alcohol, helping to reduce cravings and improving
motivation to quit. The long-acting depot form (given as monthly injections) is useful for
patients at risk for nonadherence with daily administration. Acamprosate, another abstinence-
promoting drug, works by modulating glutamate neurotransmission at the N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor.

(Choice A) The aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor disulfiram is considered a second-line
treatment for alcohol use disorder because of poorer efficacy (effectiveness depends on
supervised administration). When alcohol is ingested by a patient taking disulfiram,
acetaldehyde accumulates and causes unpleasant adverse effects (eg, nausea, vomiting,
flushing, sweating, headache).

(Choice B) Antagonism at postsynaptic dopamine receptors is the mechanism of action of
antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotics are not effective in treating alcohol use disorder.

(Choice D) Varenicline acts as a partial neuronal nicotinic receptor agonist and prevents the
nicotine stimulation of the mesolimbic dopamine system associated with nicotine addiction.
