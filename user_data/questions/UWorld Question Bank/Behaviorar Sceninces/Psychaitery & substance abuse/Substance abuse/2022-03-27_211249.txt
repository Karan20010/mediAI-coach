This patient is most likely acutely intoxicated with cocaine. Cocaine is a stimulant that inhibits
presynaptic reuptake of monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin), resulting in
sympathetic stimulation (eg, hypertension, tachycardia, light-responsive mydriasis) and CNS
activation (eg, increased arousal, euphoria, agitation, seizures).

Cocaine's ability to increase synaptic availability of norepinephrine, combined with some of its
other effects (eg, sodium channel antagonism), makes it a potent vasoconstrictor that can
promote myocardial ischemia by causing coronary artery vasospasm and increased
platelet aggregation (ie, thrombus formation). When cocaine is used intranasally, its
vasoconstrictive effects cause local ischemia resulting in mucosal atrophy that can then lead
to nasal septal perforation; these findings are highly suggestive of cocaine abuse.

(Choices A, D, and E) Inhibition of neuronal tyrosine uptake, impaired norepinephrine release
into the synaptic cleft, or blockade of postsynaptic adrenergic receptors would result in
sympatholytic effects (reduced blood pressure and heart rate).

(Choice B) Metyrosine blocks the rate-limiting step of catecholamine synthesis (tyrosine
hydroxylase). This results in decreased levels of catecholamines and sympatholytic effects.

(Choice C) Reserpine (an antihypertensive agent no longer in clinical use) blocks monoamine

entry into presynaptic vesicles, resulting in sympatholytic effects.
