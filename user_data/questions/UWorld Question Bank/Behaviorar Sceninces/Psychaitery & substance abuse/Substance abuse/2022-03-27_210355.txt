6 This man likely experienced substance-induced psychosis from phencyclidine (PCP)
intoxication. PCP is a hallucinogen that works primarily as an N-methyl-D-aspartate

9 (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is
theorized that NMDA receptor hypofunction increases the risk of psychosis partially by causing
dopamine dysregulation. Other NMDA receptor antagonists include ketamine and
dextromethorphan. PCP can also inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine, dopamine, and
serotonin and affect neuronal sigma receptors.

Moderate amounts of PCP cause dissociative symptoms. Agitation, hallucinations, and
violent behavior can occur with higher doses. Fatalities are often associated not with direct
PCP intoxication but with related trauma due to combative behavior. In addition to
belligerence, PCP is known to cause loss of coordination, horizontal and vertical
nystagmus, and a constellation of cognitive symptoms that includes disorientation, poor
judgment, and memory loss.

(Choice A) PCP is not a dopamine receptor antagonist. Dopamine receptor antagonism is
the mechanism of action of most antipsychotics.
