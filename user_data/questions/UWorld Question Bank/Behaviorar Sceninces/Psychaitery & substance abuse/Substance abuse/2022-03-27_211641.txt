(Choices B and C) Hypersomnolence and nystagmus can occur in acute ethanol intoxication
but are not common during alcohol withdrawal. Most patients have insomnia attributable to
increased CNS excitability during the withdrawal period.

(Choice D) Tonic-clonic seizures can occur 12-48 hours after the last drink and affect <5% of
patients undergoing alcohol withdrawal.

(Choice F) Alcoholic hallucinosis (ie, visual hallucinations) can develop within 12-48 hours
after the last drink. These early hallucinations are distinct from delirium tremens.

Educational objective:

Tremulousness is typically one of the earliest symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Other common
symptoms include gastrointestinal distress, agitation, anxiety, and autonomic disturbance.
Delirium tremens is the most severe manifestation of alcohol withdrawal and typically begins
48-96 hours after the last drink.
