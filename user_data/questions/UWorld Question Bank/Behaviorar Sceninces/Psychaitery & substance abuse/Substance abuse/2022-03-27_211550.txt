This patient's acute onset of tremulousness, agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure
within 48 hours of admission is suggestive of alcohol withdrawal. Alcohol is a CNS
depressant that binds to the GABA, receptor complex, enhancing the inhibitory action of
GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain). Abrupt cessation of alcohol
decreases inhibitory tone and results in CNS excitation. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms
typically start within 8-12 hours after the last drink and include insomnia, tremulousness,
anxiety, and autonomic hyperactivity (variable blood pressure, diaphoresis, and
tachycardia). Alcohol withdrawal seizures can occur within 12-48 hours, and delirium tremens
(disorientation, severe agitation, fever) typically begins within 48-96 hours.

Alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines have similar effects on GABA receptors and act by
enhancing GABA inhibitory action. Benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, diazepam,
chlordiazepoxide) are used as first-line therapy for psychomotor agitation associated with
alcohol withdrawal and to prevent progression to seizures and delirium. Longer-acting

benzodiazepines and those with active metabolites are preferred in the majority of patients due

to self-tapering effects, resulting in a smoother course of withdrawal.

(Choice A) Baclofen is an agonist of GABA B receptors and is used to treat spastic
conditions. It is less effective than benzodiazepines for treating alcohol withdrawal.
