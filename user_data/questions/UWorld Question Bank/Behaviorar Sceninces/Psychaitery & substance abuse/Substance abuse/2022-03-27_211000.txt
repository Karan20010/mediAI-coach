This patient's new-onset fatigue, hypersomnia, and vivid dreams following abrupt cessation of
prolonged stimulant (eg, dextroamphetamine) use is most likely due to stimulant withdrawal.
Decreased appetite and insomnia are the most common adverse effects of stimulant
medications used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and abrupt stimulant
withdrawal is associated with the opposite symptoms of fatigue, hypersomnia, and
hyperphagia. Dysphoric mood may also occur.

Use of supratherapeutic doses of prescribed stimulants or use that deviates from prescription
instructions (eg, insufflation to attain a euphoric effect) increases the risk for withdrawal and
adverse effects. Depending on the half-life of the agent used, symptoms of stimulant
withdrawal typically present within hours to days of cessation or reduction of heavy or
prolonged use and resolve without treatment. In contrast to withdrawal from alcohol,
benzodiazepines, and opiates, physical symptoms in stimulant withdrawal are minor.

(Choices D, E, and F) Seizures, tachycardia, and tremors are features of alcohol and

benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes. These features may be seen in stimulant overdose
