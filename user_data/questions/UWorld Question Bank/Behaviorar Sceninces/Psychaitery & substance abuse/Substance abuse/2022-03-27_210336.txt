This patient is agitated, disoriented, and tremulous with autonomic hyperactivity (eg,
hypertension, tachycardia). Development of these symptoms after a period of forced
abstinence (ie, admission to the hospital) is consistent with alcohol withdrawal, particularly in
patients with known problematic alcohol use.

Alcohol is a strong CNS depressant that binds to the GABAA receptor complex, enhancing the
inhibitory action of GABA (the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain), leading to
sedation. Chronic ethanol use causes compensatory downregulation of GABAA
receptors in an attempt to maintain CNS homeostasis. In addition to its effects on GABA
neurotransmission, alcohol also inhibits excitatory NMDA glutamate receptors in the brain;
similar to GABA receptors, chronic exposure leads to compensatory upregulation of NMDA
receptors.

Abrupt cessation of alcohol use leads to significantly decreased GABA activity due to the
decreased number of GABAA receptors (Choice A) and increased glutamate activity due to
the increased number of NMDA receptors, resulting in CNS overexcitation and the symptoms
of alcohol withdrawal.

(Choice C) Increased activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the CNS decreases
