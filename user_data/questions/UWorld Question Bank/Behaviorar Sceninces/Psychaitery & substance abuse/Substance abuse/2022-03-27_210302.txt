This patient's psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, paranoia), pressured speech, and signs of
sympathetic stimulation (eg, diaphoresis, tremulousness, tachycardia, hypertension,
mydriasis) are most consistent with cocaine intoxication. In high doses, cocaine and other
stimulants (eg, methamphetamine) may cause paranoid delusions that are often
indistinguishable from those found in primary psychotic disorders (eg, schizophrenia).

Auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations (eg, insects crawling under the skin) may also occur.
Patients under the influence of stimulants frequently exhibit euphoria, hyperactivity, agitation,
and grandiosity that may resemble an acute manic episode.

(Choice A) Anticholinergic toxicity may cause tachycardia, hypertension, mydriasis, and
psychosis. However, anticholinergic toxicity is characterized by both dry skin and mucous
membranes rather than diaphoresis and presents with other classic anticholinergic effects (eg,
urinary retention, decreased bowel sounds, hyperthermia).

(Choice B) Dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and tremors are not expected in a primary manic
episode of bipolar disorder. A diagnosis of bipolar disorder cannot be made if there is
evidence that symptoms can be attributed to the physiological effects of a substance (eg,
cocaine).
