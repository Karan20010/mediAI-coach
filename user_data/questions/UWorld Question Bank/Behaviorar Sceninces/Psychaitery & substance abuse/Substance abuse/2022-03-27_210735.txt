Marijuana (cannabis) is one of the most commonly used drugs in the United States. Itis a
cannabinoid that contains the active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Smoking is the
preferred route of delivery, and once inhaled, marijuana produces effects that last from 1-4
hours. THC stimulates cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2 receptors) to produce effects on

mood, perception, and cognition.

Marijuana produces a mild euphoria with inappropriate laughter, sedation, slowed reflexes,
impaired motor coordination, distorted sensory perceptions, and cognitive impairment
(decreased attention, concentration, short-term memory, and judgment). The most
characteristic physiological signs of marijuana intoxication are conjunctival injection (red
eyes), tachycardia, increased appetite, and dry mouth.

Marijuana is metabolized in the liver, distributed and stored in lipophilic tissues, and slowly
released. It remains in the body for a long time; depending on the amount and frequency of
use, it can be detected in the urine up to 30 days after daily use has ceased.

(Choices A and F) Cannabis intoxication results in tachycardia and does not cause
respiratory depression. Bradycardia can occur with GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), opiate,
or benzodiazepine intoxication. In toxic doses, all three central nervous system depressants

can cause respiratory depression.
