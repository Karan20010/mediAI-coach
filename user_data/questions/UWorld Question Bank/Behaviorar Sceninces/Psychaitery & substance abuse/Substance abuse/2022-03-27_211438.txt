Strategies for safe opioid prescribing

Optimize non-opioid
interventions

Use acetaminophen/NSAIDs, supportive care (eg,
heat/ice) for mild/moderate pain
Avoid routine opioid use for chronic pain

Optimize opioid dose and
duration

Limit therapy to <5 days for acute pain
Use lowest dose resulting in adequate pain control
Avoid long-acting opioids

Optimize monitoring

Counsel patients on safe use; arrange close
follow-up

Educate patients on safe disposal of unused
opioids
