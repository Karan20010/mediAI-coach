This patient's history of substance abuse, miosis, profound sedation, and respiratory
depression with rapid reversal of signs/symptoms with antidotal therapy is consistent with an
opioid overdose. Several opioid receptor subtypes, including mu, delta, and kappa, have
been identified. Available opioid medications (eg, morphine, hydromorphone) produce
therapeutic analgesic effects by binding to these receptors and modulating pain perception.

Naloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist devoid of any agonist properties. Although it
antagonizes opioid effects at all receptor types, it has the greatest affinity for mu receptors
(responsible for opioid-induced cardiorespiratory depression). Naloxone competes with opioid
medications, displacing them from opioid receptors; it is therefore an ideal agent for reversing
opioid intoxication/overdose. Reversal effects can occur within minutes, and the duration is
dose dependent (usually 1-4 hours). Naloxone must be given parenterally because it is
metabolically inactivated by the liver when administered orally.

(Choice A) Medications with an affinity for 5-HT (serotonin) receptors do not have a role in the
treatment of opioid overdose. Cyproheptadine, a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonist, is an oral
medication that can be used to treat serotonin syndrome. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist

that may be administered intravenously for nausea and vomiting.
