(Choice B) GABA-A receptor modulation is the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines, a
drug class with sedative, antianxiety, and anticonvulsant properties. PCP may have some
effect on GABA receptors, but this is not its primary mechanism of action.

(Choice C) Mu-opioid receptors are the primary site for the analgesic effects of opioids.

(Choice E) Serotonin receptor agonism is the mechanism of action of triptans, buspirone (an
anxiolytic), and many psychedelic drugs (eg, LSD, psilocybin).

Educational objective:

Phencyclidine (PCP) is primarily an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, with lesser
effects on the reuptake inhibition of biogenic amines and other receptors. It can have
dissociative and anesthetic effects but may also cause psychosis and severe agitation, leading
to violent trauma. Ataxia, horizontal and vertical nystagmus, and memory loss can also be
present.
