Opioid use disorder is a significant health concern in the United States and has high levels of
morbidity and mortality. Opioids are prescribed for their analgesic properties, but they also
have euphoric effects with the potential for tolerance, dependence, and abuse. Both street
and prescription opioids have a high abuse potential. Treatment of addiction includes the use
of alternative opioid agonists with fewer euphoric effects and less potential for acute
withdrawal and craving, thereby allowing patients to function more productively on a daily
basis. In the United States, the most commonly used agonists are methadone and

buprenorphine.

Methadone is a full mu-opioid receptor agonist used for withdrawal and maintenance
treatment for opioid use disorder. It has a long half-life, which allows it to effectively
suppress cravings and withdrawal symptoms; it also blocks the euphoric effects of other
opioids by maintaining high tolerance levels (Choice B). Adverse effects of methadone
include QT interval prolongation and respiratory depression, accounting for its lethality in
overdose.

(Choices C and E) Methadone, like other opioids, produces dependence, and abrupt

discontinuation of methadone causes withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms of methadone
withdrawal are more prolonged and less severe than those of heroin due to methadone's long
