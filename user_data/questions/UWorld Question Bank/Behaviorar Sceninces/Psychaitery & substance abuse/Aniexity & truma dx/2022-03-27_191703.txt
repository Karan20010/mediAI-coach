Although separation anxiety is common in young children and in older children at times of
change or stress, this patient's distress is excessive and impairing when she is separated from
her mother. Her inability to sleep away from home, abdominal pain when separated from her
mother, worries about losing her parents, and nightmares about being left alone are consistent
with separation anxiety disorder. Children with this disorder commonly experience physical
symptoms (eg, headaches, stomach aches, nausea) when separation occurs or is
anticipated, and have repeated nightmares involving the theme of separation. According to
DSM-5, symptoms must be present for 24 weeks in children and 26 months in adults.

(Choice A) This girl's symptoms predate the stressor of starting a new school. In addition,
adjustment disorders are not diagnosed when symptoms better meet the criteria for another
disorder. As in this patient, stressful events often exacerbate symptoms of another disorder.

(Choice B) Patients with dependent personality disorder fear being left alone and seek out
others to support and assume responsibility for them. However, personality disorders are not
diagnosed in children as their personalities are still developing.

(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder involves chronic anxiety regarding multiple issues.
This patient's symptoms occur in the context of separation, making separation anxiety disorder
the appropriate diagnosis.
