Recurrent episodes of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, and
paresthesia lasting <10 minutes in a young, otherwise healthy patient are characteristic of
panic disorder. Onset of panic attacks is unexpected and sudden, accompanied by an
abrupt surge in anxiety and fear. Patients with panic disorder worry about recurrent
attacks and frequently avoid situations due to fears of having another attack.

Panic disorder is characterized by prominent, paroxysmal, physical symptoms (eg,
cardiorespiratory, gastrointestinal), and patients may not receive an accurate diagnosis until
repeated medical workups are negative. Due to delays in diagnosis, some patients may
become preoccupied with fears of having an undiagnosed condition, resulting in high health
care use (eg, recurrent emergency department visits).

(Choice A) Conversion disorder (also called functional neurological symptom disorder)
involves development of a neurological symptom that is inconsistent with a known neurological
disease. This patient's dizziness and paresthesia occur only in the context of abrupt-onset
and episodic cardiorespiratory symptoms, which is characteristic of panic disorder.

(Choice B) In factitious disorder, patients intentionally falsify symptoms to assume the sick
role; evidence of falsification is necessary for diagnosis. There is no indication that this patient

is fabricating her symptoms.
