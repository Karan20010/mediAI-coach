A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to nonspecific stomachaches and
pains. She has no other medical history. The patient has missed more than 10 days of school
due to the symptoms since the academic year started 6 months ago. The mother says that
her daughter has always been anxious with a "sensitive stomach," but the symptoms have
worsened since the patient's best friend moved away a month ago. She has a few other
friends but prefers to stay home and does not participate in after-school activities. The mother
says, "She worried for weeks about going to a party. On the night of the party she had an
anxiety attack and started hyperventilating. She ended up not going to the party at all." The
patient says she is "just very shy" and is afraid of being embarrassed or "looking stupid"
around others. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. During the interview, the
patient makes little eye contact and gives brief answers to questions. Which of the following is
the most likely diagnosis?

() A. Adjustment disorder with anxiety
©) B. Agoraphobia

() C. Generalized anxiety disorder
