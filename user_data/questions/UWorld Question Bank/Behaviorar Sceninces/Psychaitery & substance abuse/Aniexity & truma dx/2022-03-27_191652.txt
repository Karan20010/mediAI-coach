A 9-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother for evaluation of frequent stomach
aches. The mother says that her daughter has always had a "sensitive stomach" but that it
has gotten worse since she started going to a new school a few months ago. The girl has
been missing class due to being in the nurse's office multiple times per week. The patient's
symptoms improve when her mother comes to get her. In response to the doctor's questions
about the girl's peer relationships, the mother replies, "She has friends but never enjoys
sleepovers." When the patient is at a friend's house, she often complains of stomach pain and
nausea. She occasionally has nightmares about being left alone and wakes up crying.
Although both parents are healthy, the patient says she worries about them "dying of a terrible
illness, like cancer." Abdominal examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is
the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

©) A. Adjustment disorder with anxious mood
(©) B. Dependent personality disorder
(©) C. Generalized anxiety disorder

©) D. Illness anxiety disorder
