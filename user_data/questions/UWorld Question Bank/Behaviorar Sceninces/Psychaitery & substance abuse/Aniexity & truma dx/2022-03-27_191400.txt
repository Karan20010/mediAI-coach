(Choice A) Acute stress disorder involves symptoms similar to those observed in PTSD,
which last 3 days to 1 month after trauma exposure. Symptoms may remit or progress to
PTSD after this time. This patient has symptoms lasting 2 months and so meets the criteria for
P1SD.

(Choice B) In agoraphobia, the patient avoids situations where escape may not be possible
or help is not available if panic or other embarrassing symptoms occur. If the avoidance is
secondary to a traumatic event and the criteria for PTSD are met, PTSD is the accurate
diagnosis.

(Choice C) This patient's experience of hearing her assailant's voice is characteristic of an
intrusive flashback that occurs in PTSD. Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by acute
onset of psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations) lasting 21 day and <1 month.

(Choices D and E) Patients with PTSD often experience a range of dissociative symptoms,
such as derealization (detachment from surroundings), depersonalization (detachment from
self), or a lapse of autobiographical memory regarding the traumatic event (dissociative
amnesia). If the dissociation is part of a cluster of symptoms that meets the criteria for PTSD,
PTSD is the overarching and correct diagnosis.
