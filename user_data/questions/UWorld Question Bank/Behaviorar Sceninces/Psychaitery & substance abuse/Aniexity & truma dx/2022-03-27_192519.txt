patient who must encounter the phobic stimulus at work on a daily basis.

(Choices C and G) Escitalopram (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor), and venlafaxine (a
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) are used to treat depression in addition to panic
disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and social anxiety disorder. They are not first-line

treatments for specific phobia.

(Choice D) The beta blocker propranolol has been used to treat performance anxiety (a
subtype of social anxiety disorder) but is not useful for specific phobia.

(Choices E and F) These forms of psychotherapy would not address this patient's specific
phobia directly. Psychodynamic psychotherapy focuses on developing insight into unresolved
conflicts and the influence of past relationships on current life situations. Supportive
psychotherapy is aimed at bolstering adaptive psychological defenses to help individuals cope
with acute crises or chronic psychiatric illness.

Educational objective:
Exposure-based cognitive-behavioral therapy, in which patients are systematically confronted
with their feared objects or situations, is the most effective long-term treatment for specific

phobia.
