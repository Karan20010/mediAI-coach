(Choice C) Although patients may have the fear of "going crazy" while experiencing a panic
attack, they are not at greater risk of developing psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech and/or behavior). Acute psychotic symptoms would be
more indicative of brief psychotic disorder.

(Choices D and F) This patient is fearful of leaving home unaccompanied due to a concern
about future panic attacks rendering her helpless. In dependent personality disorder,
individuals have a lifelong pattern of seeking out relationships due to feeling helpless when
alone. Separation anxiety disorder in adults consists of 26 months of excessive and
distressing anxiety due to separation from a significant attachment figure (eg, spouse, child),
unrelated to a fear of being debilitated by panic attack symptoms.

(Choice E) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent and excessive worry
about multiple issues (eg, work, health, finances). This patient's anxiety is focused on her
panic symptoms and future attacks.
