This patient likely has panic disorder, which presents with distressing
cardiopulmonary/neurologic symptoms that reach their peak level of intensity in 10 minutes or
less and then subside. Due to the intensity of the symptoms and their tendency to mimic a
heart attack, patients may fear they are dying and seek treatment in the emergency
department.

Patients with panic disorder often develop agoraphobia, which is characterized by anxiety
about and avoidance of multiple situations where they may feel trapped and helpless in
the event of a panic attack (eg, crowds, enclosed spaces, public transportation). For example,
this patient may start avoiding bus rides due to fears of recurrent panic attacks. In severe
cases of agoraphobia, patients may restrict their activities to the point that they leave home
only with a companion or they become completely housebound.

Agoraphobia is a distinct condition and can be diagnosed with or without the presence of panic
disorder.

(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, exposure to a life-threatening trauma results in symptoms
of reexperiencing (ie, intrusive memories, flashbacks), avoidance of reminders, negative
mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal. This patient does not have a history of experiencing a
traumatic event.
