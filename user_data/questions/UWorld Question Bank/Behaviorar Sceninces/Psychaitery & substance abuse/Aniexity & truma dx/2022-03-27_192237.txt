A 35-year-old woman comes to the office due to worsening fatigue and tension headaches
over the past year. She describes always feeling "on edge" and lies awake at night worrying
about various issues such as whether she is good at her job, whether her grown children like
her, if she will get cancer one day, and whether her house will be broken into. During the day
she feels tired and her shoulders and neck ache; she has difficulty concentrating on her work
and has become increasingly concerned about losing her job. The patient has no medical or
psychiatric history. Physical examination and routine laboratory studies, including thyroid

function tests, are normal. The patient's anxiety has never been treated, but she once took a

tablet of alprazolam offered by a friend. This lowered her anxiety, but the effect did not last
long. The patient drinks a glass of wine on rare social occasions and does not use illicit
drugs. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

© A. Alprazolam
©) B. Bupropion
© C. Citalopram

©) D. Clonazepam
