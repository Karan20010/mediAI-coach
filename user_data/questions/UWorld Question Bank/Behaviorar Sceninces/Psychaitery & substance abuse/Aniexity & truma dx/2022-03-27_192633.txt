Educational objective:

Panic disorder consists of recurrent and unexpected panic attacks characterized by an abrupt
surge of anxiety and distressing cardiopulmonary/neurologic symptoms. Agoraphobia, a
common comorbid disorder, results in anxiety about and avoidance of situations where
patients may feel trapped and helpless in the event of a panic attack (eg, crowds, enclosed

spaces, public transportation).
