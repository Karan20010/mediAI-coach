Question Id: 11838

This patient's recurrent, unexpected anxiety attacks and physical symptoms of dizziness,
sweating, shaking, and nausea without an identifiable medical cause are consistent with panic
disorder. Affected patients usually worry about having future attacks, as in this case, and

frequently develop avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia.

Treatment options for panic disorder include antidepressants and/or cognitive-behavioral
therapy. Among the antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are the preferred first-line therapy because of
their relatively benign adverse effect profile compared with that of monoamine oxidase
inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants (Choices C and F).

Benzodiazepines are also effective in panic disorder and have a more rapid onset of action.
However, because of the risks for abuse and addiction, they are typically reserved for short-
term use in acutely symptomatic and functionally impaired patients who require rapid relief.
They should be avoided in patients with a history of or high risk for substance misuse, such as
this patient (Choice A).

(Choice B) Although this patient has prominent physical symptoms, beta blockers as
monotherapy are not effective in panic disorder. They can be used to treat the physiologic

manifestations of performance anxiety.
