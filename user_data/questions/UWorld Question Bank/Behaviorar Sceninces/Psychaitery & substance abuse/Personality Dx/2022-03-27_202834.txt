A 38-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance due to severe
abdominal pain and undergoes an emergency appendectomy. Following a successful
operation and recovery, the patient questions whether the appendectomy was absolutely
necessary. He doubts the surgeon's explanation that the surgery was potentially lifesaving,
angrily suggests that the hospital is taking advantage of his excellent medical insurance, and
makes vague threats to sue the hospital. He asks to be discharged immediately, and explains,
"I've earned everything | have on my own, and this hospital isn't getting any of it.". When asked
if he has any relatives or friends the team can speak with, he says, "| haven't talked to my
family in 20 years, and | wouldn't call anyone my friend. Even if | did, that's none of your
business." Which of the following is the most likely explanation of this patient's behavior?

©) A. Antisocial personality disorder
