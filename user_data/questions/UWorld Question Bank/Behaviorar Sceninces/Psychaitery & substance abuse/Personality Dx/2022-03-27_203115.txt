(Choices B and E) The parietal cortex processes and interprets visual, auditory, and motor
signals received from other brain areas. Parietal cortex damage results in difficulties with

to

spatial and visual perception. Dominant lesions (>95% of right-handed and >50% of left-
handed patients are left hemisphere dominant) result in Gerstmann syndrome with right-left
confusion and difficulty with writing and mathematics. Nondominant parietal cortex lesions
(most commonly right-sided) can result in hemi-neglect, constructional apraxia, and denial of
the problem.

(Choices C and F) Temporal cortex injury can cause disturbances in language, sensory
interpretation, and impaired memory. These patients can also exhibit behavioral changes,
such as apathy, hyperorality, hypersexuality, and visual agnosia as seen in Kliver-Bucy
syndrome. Nondominant (usually right-sided) lesions can affect nonverbal memory, including
musical ability; dominant left-sided lesions can affect verbal memory, such as word
recognition. This patient's symptoms are most characteristic of an OFC injury.

(Choice D) The lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in executive functioning, which includes
motivation, organization, planning, and purposeful action. Damage to the lateral prefrontal
cortex may result in dysexecutive syndrome, a syndrome characterized by significant

difficulties performing these functions.
