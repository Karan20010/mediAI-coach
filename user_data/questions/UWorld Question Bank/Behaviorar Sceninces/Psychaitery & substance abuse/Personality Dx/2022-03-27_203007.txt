This patient's pattern of avoiding social interactions and hypersensitivity to criticism is
characteristic of avoidant personality disorder. Patients with this disorder typically have
very limited social relationships due to the fear of being judged, embarrassed, or rejected.
They desire social acceptance and may fantasize about having relationships, as in this patient;
however, they struggle with feelings of inadequacy and pursue relationships only if certain of
absolute acceptance by others. Occupational dysfunction due to difficulties interacting with
coworkers or turning down promotions due to fear of criticism is common.

(Choice A) Acute stress disorder involves exposure to a life-threatening event with resulting
flashbacks, intrusive memories, avoidance, negative mood, hyperarousal, and dissociation
from reality.

(Choice B) In adjustment disorder with anxiety, a disproportionate level of worry develops
within 3 months of onset of an identifiable stressor. This patient's chronic anxiety symptoms
appear to be related to a longstanding fear of rejection in social situations and low self-esteem,
which is more consistent with avoidant personality disorder.

(Choice C) Antisocial personality disorder is marked by persistent disregard for and violation
of the rights of others. Individuals with this disorder are often risk-takers who exhibit criminal

behavior.
