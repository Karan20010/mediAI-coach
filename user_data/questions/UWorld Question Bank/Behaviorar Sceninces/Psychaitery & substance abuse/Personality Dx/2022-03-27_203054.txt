behavior. Two months ago, the patient was robbed and hit in the head and knees with a
baseball bat when he resisted. He initially had difficulty walking, but his injuries have since
healed. His wife and other family members say that his overall demeanor has changed
significantly since the attack. Prior to the assault, the patient was kind, considerate, and
extremely polite. However, since the attack, he has been very irritable and rude, and was
recently fired from his job for insulting customers and making socially insensitive comments to
coworkers. Damage to which anatomical region of the brain is the most likely explanation for
this patient's symptoms?
