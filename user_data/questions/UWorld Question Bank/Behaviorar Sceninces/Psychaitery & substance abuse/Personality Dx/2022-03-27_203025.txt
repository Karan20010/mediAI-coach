A 38-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of discomfort in his wrists. He thinks his
symptoms may be related to "typing all day, every day." The patient is a software engineer

and prefers to work remotely from home to "avoid wasting time talking and interacting with
coworkers." He rarely leaves his apartment and spends his spare time on his computer,
reading online forums about space exploration and the possibility of alien life. When asked
about relationships he says, "I've always liked being on my own." He spent a large portion of
his childhood disassembling and rebuilding electronic devices and had few friends. His affect
appears constricted and his responses to questions are limited. Which of the following is the
most likely personality disorder in this patient?

©) A. Antisocial
©) B. Avoidant
() C. Obsessive-compulsive
©) D. Paranoid
