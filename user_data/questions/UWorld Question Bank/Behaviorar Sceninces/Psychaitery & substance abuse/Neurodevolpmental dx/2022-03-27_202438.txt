This patient is experiencing both vocal and multiple motor tics (sudden, intermittent,
nonrhythmic motor movements and vocalizations) consistent with a diagnosis of Tourette
syndrome. Vocal tics can range from simple sounds (eg, coughing, grunting, throat clearing)
to blurting out inappropriate comments and obscenities (coprolalia). They are typically
preceded by irresistible urges and followed by feelings of relief. Tics have a waxing and
waning course and are typically exacerbated by stress or fatigue, but they can be suppressed
voluntarily for brief periods.

Tourette syndrome is more common in boys and typically presents at age 6-15. Comorbid
psychiatric conditions such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-
compulsive disorder are common.

(Choice A) Although ADHD is a common comorbidity, this patient does not exhibit sufficient
symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity required for this diagnosis.

(Choice B) Stereotypic movement disorder is characterized by simple repetitive movements
(eg, rocking, head banging), which are voluntary in nature and seemingly purposeless. They
are often seen in children with autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability and are a
common form of self-soothing.
