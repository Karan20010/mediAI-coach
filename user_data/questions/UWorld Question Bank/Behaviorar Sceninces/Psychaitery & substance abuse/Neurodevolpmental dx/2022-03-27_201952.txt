A 27-year-old man is brought to a family therapist by his wife following a violent outburst in
which he nearly injured her. They were having what seemed like a minor argument over a
miscommunication about her being late when he suddenly flew into a rage, started shouting,
and threw several plates against the wall. His wife is now threatening to leave him because
similar episodes keep happening despite his promise to control his anger. The patient is
remorseful and says, "| have been getting into trouble because of my temper since high
school. Once | get angry, | feel out of control and it's impossible to stop." The patient has no
medical history. He drinks beer and uses cannabis to relax approximately 2-3 times a month.
