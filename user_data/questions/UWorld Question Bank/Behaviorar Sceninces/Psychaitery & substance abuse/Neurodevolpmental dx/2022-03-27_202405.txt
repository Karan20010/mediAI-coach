This patient's behavior is most consistent with mild, high-functioning autism spectrum
disorder (ASD). Patients diagnosed with ASD later in childhood and adolescence frequently
have normal or near-normal language and intellectual ability and come to clinical attention
when social and academic demands increase, exposing a lack of flexibility and social skill
deficits (more severe ASD is usually diagnosed by age 5). Key features of ASD include
deficits in social communication and reciprocal social interactions as well as restricted,
repetitive interests and stereotyped behaviors.

This patient's lack of friends, social isolation, insistence on sameness, intensely fixated
interests, and trouble taking turns in conversation are characteristic. Patients with autism have
difficulty interpreting and responding appropriately to nonverbal aspects of communication.
Abnormal eye contact, stilted, overly formal speech, abnormal sensory sensitivity, and unusual
repetitive movements (hand flapping, rocking) are other common findings.

(Choice B) Obsessive-compulsive disorder may also present with obsessive interests and
insistence on routines. However, this patient lacks the intrusive obsessional thoughts and
compulsive rituals performed in response to these thoughts required for this diagnosis (eg,
thoughts of contamination leading to cleaning rituals).

Choices C and D) Personality disorders are not diagnosed when the behavior is better
