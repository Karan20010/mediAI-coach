A 10-year-old boy is brought to the office due to poor grades and behavioral problems.
Although the patient is very intelligent, his parents report that he struggles at school and has
received failing grades because he is easily distracted, makes careless mistakes, and often
loses his homework. His teacher has called several times to report that he repeatedly disrupts
the class by getting out of his seat and by blurting out answers when he is not called on. At
home, the patient does not listen to his parents, does not clean up after himself, and fails to
complete chores despite repeated redirection. He has no other medical conditions. Family
history is significant for a substance use disorder in the patient's 16-year-old brother and
depression in his mother. Treatment options are discussed with the parents. They would like
to try medication but prefer a nonstimulant option. Which of the following is the most
appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient?

© A. Alprazolam
