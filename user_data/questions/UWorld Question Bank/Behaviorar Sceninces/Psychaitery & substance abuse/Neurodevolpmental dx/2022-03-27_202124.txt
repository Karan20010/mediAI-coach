e Adjunctive pharmacotherapy for psychiatric comorbidities

This child's lack of social engagement, speech delay, and repetitive play are consistent with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). ASD is more common in boys.

Deficits often become apparent by the second year of life, with the diagnosis typically made
before age 5. In higher-functioning cases, ASD may be diagnosed later, when social
expectations increase and deficits become more noticeable.

ASD can occur with varying degrees of language and intellectual impairment. Language
deficits can range from odd, stilted speech to delayed or complete lack of intelligible speech.
Other features of ASD include impaired joint attention (eg, lack of pointing or bringing objects
to others), motor stereotypies (eg, hand flapping, spinning), and hyperreactivity or
hyporeactivity to sensory input (eg, extreme responses to sounds or textures, indifference to
pain).

(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when symptoms develop within 3 months of
an identifiable stressor. Although the mother's pregnancy and family's move to a new home
may be stressful for the boy, it would not explain his lack of language acquisition, poor social

interaction, and repetitive play.
