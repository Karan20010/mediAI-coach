A 24-month-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to concerns about walking. The
mother says, "She seems so unsteady when she walks. She was walking so well until a few
weeks ago, and now she keeps tripping over things." On examination, the patient is sitting on
the floor and clapping her hands. She does not answer questions and instead makes babbling
sounds. When her mother encourages her to walk, the patient pulls to stand using a chair and
has an unsteady gait. The remainder of the examination is normal apart from abrasions on
both knees, which her mother explains are from frequent falls. Height and weight track at the
50th percentile. At a checkup 6 months ago, the patient had been saying 1- or 2-word phrases
and walking without aid. Which of the following neuropathic changes most likely underlies this
patient's presentation?

A. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (11%)
JY B. Arrested brain development (48%)

C. Copper deposition in the lenticular nucleus (21%)

D. Cortical hyperexpansion (17%)

E. Hypoxic ischemic injury during delivery (2%)
