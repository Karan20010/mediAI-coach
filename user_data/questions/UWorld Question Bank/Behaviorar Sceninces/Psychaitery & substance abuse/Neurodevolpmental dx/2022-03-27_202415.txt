A 10-year-old boy is brought to the pediatric clinic due to unusual classroom behavior for the
past year, which has worsened over the last few weeks. Although the patient is generally
quiet, he intermittently disrupts the class with sniffling, repetitive throat clearing, and grunting
sounds. His teacher states that the boy distracts other students and that his focus in class is
poor. The behaviors worsen when he is tired, stressed, or excited. The patient's parents are
also concerned because he has only a few friends and his classmates make fun of him.
Medical history is significant for recurrent otitis media as a toddler, atopic dermatitis, and an
influenza infection 9 months ago. Family history is significant for rheumatoid arthritis and

anxiety in his mother. Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), pulse is 78/min, blood pressure is 110/72

mm Hg, and respirations are 14/min. Physical examination shows frequent eye blinking and

diagnosis?

©) A. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
