A 9-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician due to poor school performance and difficulty
making friends. His parents say he always had "very high energy," but they noticed that this
got worse after they moved 8 months ago, which they attributed to a normal adjustment
period. Over the past several months, however, the parents have received repeated phone
calls from his teachers, reporting that he does not listen in class, has difficulty staying in his
seat, turns in assignments late without his name, and frequently disrupts the class by talking
out of turn. At home the boy forgets to do his daily chores, regularly loses his books and
homework, and delays the family by taking too long getting ready for school in the morning.
When his older brother teases him about this, the patient becomes irritable, and on a few
occasions has shouted profanities and tried to hit his brother. Which of the following is the
most likely explanation for this patient's behavior?

©) A. Adjustment disorder
© B. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(©) C. Conduct disorder

©) D. Social anxiety disorder
