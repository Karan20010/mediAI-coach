Although stimulants (eg, dextroamphetamine, methylphenidate) are commonly used for ADHD
due to their rapid onset and larger treatment effect size, they have the potential for misuse
(Choices F and H). For patients who do not want a stimulant, nonstimulant options,
including norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (eg, atomoxetine, viloxazine) or alpha-2
adrenergic agonists (eg, clonidine, guanfacine), are available. Atomoxetine is a first-line
nonstimulant alternative that lacks abuse potential and is not a controlled substance.

(Choice A) The benzodiazepine alprazolam has abuse potential and is not effective in treating
ADHD.

(Choices B and E) Tricyclic antidepressants (eg, amitriptyline) and norepinephrine and
dopamine reuptake inhibitors (eg, bupropion) are not first-line agents in the treatment of

ADHD; they are sometimes used for refractory cases.

(Choice C) Aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic that has no role in the treatment
of ADHD.
