(Choice C) Fragile X syndrome mainly affects males and is associated with CGG trinucleotide
repeats on the X chromosome. Features include intellectual disability; a long, narrow face;
large protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism.

(Choice D) Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by a
deficiency in HGPRT (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), leading to an
increase in uric acid levels. Although hypotonia and involuntary movements such as hand
wringing may be present, developmental milestones are typically delayed rather than normal.
Gout and self-mutilating behaviors (eg, lip and finger biting) are commonly seen.

(Choice F) Tay-Sachs disease is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency in beta-
hexosaminidase A (Hex A). Like Rett syndrome, it presents with a regression of motor skills,
but it typically begins earlier (age 2-6 months) and is associated with macrocephaly and a
cherry red spot on the macula.

Educational objective:

Rett syndrome is characterized by loss of speech and motor skills, deceleration of head
growth, and stereotypic purposeless hand movements after a period of normal development.
It affects mainly girls and is associated with mutations in the MECP2 gene.
