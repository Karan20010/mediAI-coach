and ataxia, it typically presents in adolescence with liver disease; Kayser-Fleischer rings are
nearly always present by the time neurologic symptoms develop.

(Choice D) Cortical hyperexpansion seems to underly the brain enlargement associated with
autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Although ASD can present in toddlers with regression of
speech and stereotypical movements (eg, flapping, clapping), it does not usually cause
regression of gross motor milestones (eg, walking).

(Choice E) Hypoxic ischemic injury during delivery can lead to neonatal encephalopathy, a
condition which can result in decreased level of consciousness, seizures, and impaired
respiration. However, it would present as neurologic abnormalities shortly after birth, rather
than as a regression in milestones after previous normal development.

Educational objective:

Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by normal development until age 6-18
months, when regression of speech, loss of purposeful hand movements, development of
stereotypical movements, and gait abnormalities occur. Neuropathology shows arrested brain
development rather than neurodegeneration.
