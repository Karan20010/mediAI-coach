something wrong and explains, "My daughter used to sit on her own and loved babbling and
clapping her hands. She still plays with her sisters and likes snuggles, but for the past 3
months she hasn't babbled as much, and can no longer sit without my help. She twists her
hands together and | cannot get her to stop. | am worried that the skin on her hands is getting
red, dry, and painful." Weight and height are in the 60th percentile. The patient's head growth,
however, has decreased from the 50th to the 40th percentile in 3 months. On examination, the

apart from an occasional grunt. She shows interest in toys the doctor provides her but does
not reach out for them, wringing her hands repeatedly. Which of the following best explains
