This patient's repetitive outbursts of impulsive aggression that are grossly disproportionate to
the situation is suggestive of intermittent explosive disorder (IED), an impulse control
disorder. Patients with IED often feel a sense of heighted arousal or tension that quickly
escalates to rage and uncontrollable impulses to be verbally or physically aggressive.
Outbursts may provide an immediate sense of relief that is usually followed by remorse.
Patients can be assaultive and destroy property, resulting in significant functional impairment
due to interpersonal difficulties, school suspension, job loss, and legal problems.

IED is not diagnosed if the violent behavior is premeditated or better explained as a
manifestation of another disorder, such as a manic episode of bipolar disorder or substance
intoxication. Treatment consists of cognitive-behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

(Choices A and D) Aggressive behavior is common in antisocial personality disorder and
conduct disorder, but it is often premeditated with the goal of intimidating others. This patient's
behavior is not premeditated, and he does not show other antisocial features such as
lawbreaking, lying, chronic irresponsibility, and lack of remorse. Conduct disorder is

diagnosed in children, whereas antisocial personality disorder is diagnosed in patients age
218.
