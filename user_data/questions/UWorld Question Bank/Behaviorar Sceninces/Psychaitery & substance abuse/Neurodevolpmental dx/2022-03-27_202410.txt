explained by another mental disorder and are generally not diagnosed before age 18.

Patients with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder are preoccupied with orderliness and
control but do not have deficits in social communication. Patients with schizoid personality
disorder are socially isolated and disinterested in relationships, but do not exhibit the restricted
interests and repetitive patterns seen in ASD.

(Choice E) Separation anxiety disorder is characterized by developmentally inappropriate and
excessive anxiety related to separation from the primary attachment figure.

(Choice F) Patients with social anxiety disorder typically have normal communication skills
and an interest in socializing, but they avoid social situations due to fear of being judged. In
patients with ASD, social anxiety is related to their lack of social skills.

Educational objective:

Patients with milder forms of autism spectrum disorder frequently have normal language and
cognitive development. Characteristic features include deficits in social communication and
reciprocal social interactions, restricted interests, and behavioral rigidity that become more
apparent as social and academic demands increase.
