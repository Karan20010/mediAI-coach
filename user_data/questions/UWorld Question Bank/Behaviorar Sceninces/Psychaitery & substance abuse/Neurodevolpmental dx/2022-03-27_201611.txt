This patient's inattention, distractibility, disorganization, and forgetfulness are characteristic of
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Norepinephrine and dopamine are the key
neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of ADHD symptoms. Symptoms of
hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention have been linked to reduced levels of norepinephrine

and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.

Stimulant drugs, including methylphenidate and amphetamines, are first-line drug
treatments for school-age children with ADHD. They work by blocking norepinephrine and
dopamine reuptake at synapses in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, amphetamines increase
the release of norepinephrine and dopamine from presynaptic storage vesicles and inhibit
monoamine oxidase.

(Choice A) Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists (not antagonists) are used in the treatment of ADHD
but do not have the same evidence for efficacy as stimulants. Examples include clonidine and
guanfacine.

(Choice B) Antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors is the mechanism of action of antipsychotic
medications. These drugs do not specifically treat ADHD.

(Choices D and E) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants increase availability
