(Choice C) Language impairment frequently accompanies ASD. However, an isolated
language disorder would not explain this child's lack of social interaction and restricted
interests.

(Choice D) At age 2, children should be saying 2- or 3-word phrases, engaging in parallel play
using a variety of toys, making eye contact, and responding to their names.

(Choice E) Selective mutism involves a failure to speak in specific situations (eg, school)
despite speaking in other settings. This boy's language impairment in all settings, deficits in
social reciprocity, and restricted and repetitive behaviors are characteristic of ASD.

(Choice F) In social anxiety disorder, children may have difficulty engaging with others due to
anxiety in new social circumstances but otherwise have normal communication skills. This
child's deficits are evident in multiple domains (home, school, office).

(Choice G) Social (pragmatic) communication disorder is characterized by deficits in verbal
and nonverbal communication for the purposes of social interaction. If these deficits are
accompanied by restricted patterns of behavior, such as in this child, the appropriate diagnosis
is ASD.
