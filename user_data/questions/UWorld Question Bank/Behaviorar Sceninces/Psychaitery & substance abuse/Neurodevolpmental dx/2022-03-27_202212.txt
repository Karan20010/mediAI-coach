(Choice E) Oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) involves a pattern of angry/irritable mood and
argumentative/defiant behavior toward authority figures. Symptoms of ODD are less severe
than those of conduct disorder. ODD does not include physical aggression, stealing, or

destruction of property, as seen in this patient.

(Choice F) Pyromania is characterized by intentional and repeated fire setting with no obvious
motive; it does not involve other behaviors seen in conduct disorder (eg, lying, theft, cruelty to
others). Aseparate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of
conduct disorder.

Educational objective:

Conduct disorder involves a persistent pattern of violating major societal norms or the rights of
others. Behaviors include aggression toward people and animals, deceitfulness or theft,
destruction of property, and serious violation of rules.
