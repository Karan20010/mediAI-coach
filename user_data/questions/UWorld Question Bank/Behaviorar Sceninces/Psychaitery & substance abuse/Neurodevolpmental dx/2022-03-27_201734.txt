A learning disorder is characterized by difficulties with key academic skills (reading,
writing, or mathematics). Problems manifest at school age when these skills are being
acquired, and performance is well below average for age. Many children display symptoms of
anxiety, inattention, defiance, or hyperactivity when under stress to perform in an area of
weakness, as exemplified by this child's struggle to pay attention and his emotional outburst in
class. Learning disorders are often comorbid (eg, writing plus reading). In addition to
academic dysfunction, they can also impact social skills and self-confidence.

Definitive diagnosis requires comprehensive assessment, including educational testing and
ruling out intellectual disability, hearing or vision impairment, and other psychiatric or
neurological disorders. Providers should consider the possibility of a learning disorder in any
child presenting with school difficulty. Early intervention can be helpful in improving self-
esteem and preventing further disability.

(Choice A) Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by inattention and/or
hyperactivity-impulsivity across at least 2 settings. There is no indication that this child
struggles with inattention or hyperactivity when asked to read or do math or that this is a
problem in the home setting.
