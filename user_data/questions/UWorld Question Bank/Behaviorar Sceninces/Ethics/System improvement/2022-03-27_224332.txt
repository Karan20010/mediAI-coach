According to The Joint Commission's sentinel event statistics, wrong-site surgery is the most
frequently reported serious adverse event. Emergency operations, failure to mark the surgical
site, poor communication, and surgeon fatigue are contributing factors. As in this case,
multiple procedures on the same patient and multiple surgeons will also increase the risk of
operating at the wrong site. Therefore, a preoperative verification process is important to
decrease this risk. In addition to marking the operative site, independent verification of the
patient, procedure, and site by 2 health care workers (eg, a nurse and physician) should be
performed. The "dual identifiers" must perform the verification independently because 2
clinicians verifying identifiers together can result in replicating an error. The Joint Commission
recommends use of a "surgical timeout" immediately prior to the procedure in order to conduct
a final verification of the patient, procedure, and site.

(Choice A) Although an awake and aware patient can participate in the verification process,
this is not an adequate substitute for dual independent clinician identification.

(Choice B) Having these 2 clinicians verify the site together is not optimal as it increases the
risk that they will replicate the error.

(Choices C and E) Two independent identifiers are preferred.
