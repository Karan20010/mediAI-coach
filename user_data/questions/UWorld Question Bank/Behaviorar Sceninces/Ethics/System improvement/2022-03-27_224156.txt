The transition from hospital to outpatient care is a time of high risk for patients. Individuals
with multiple medical problems, complex medication regimens, low health literacy, and poor
social support are at particularly high risk. The most effective strategy for decreasing adverse
outcomes and preventing avoidable readmissions is a structured approach that uses a
comprehensive discharge checklist. The checklist should provide instructions at the
appropriate literacy level and patient education materials to facilitate a successful transition
from the hospital to the outpatient setting. Key elements of the discharge checklist include
detailed instructions regarding medications (their purpose, dosing schedule, and adverse
events), follow-up appointments with the primary care provider and any specialists, pending
laboratory measurements or tests, and an emergency contact number with specific directions
on when to call. Medication changes that have occurred during the hospitalization (eg, new
medications, discontinued medications, changes in dose or frequency) should be clearly
identified on the checklist to reduce the risk of medication errors.

(Choice A) Although emphasizing the importance of adherence to treatment is beneficial, a
detailed list with specific instructions regarding medications and follow-up that the patient can
refer to at home would be more helpful. Patients are frequently overwhelmed by verbal
information at the time of discharge and can benefit from a written checklist.
