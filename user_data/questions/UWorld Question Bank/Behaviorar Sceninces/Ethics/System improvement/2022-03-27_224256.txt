Obesity is a multifactorial condition with genetic, environmental, and behavioral causes. In

this community, obesity prevalence is significantly higher in specific ZIP codes, indicating a
possible health disparity (ie, preventable health differences associated with social,
environmental, or economic disadvantage).

Obesity-related health disparities represent a major public health concern with increased
prevalence, severity, and complications affecting vulnerable communities. Such disparities
involve factors relating to health care (eg, provider screening and treatment, access to care),
patients (eg, diet and activity, health knowledge), and neighborhood (eg, density of grocery
stores, which influences dietary patterns; crime rate, which influences physical activity).

Given the multifactorial nature of obesity and related disparities, the first step in researching
this community's trend is to generate hypotheses. This is best achieved through cross-
sectional analysis of demographic and behavioral data, which is relatively easy to perform
and can depict multiple risk factors at one point in time (a "snapshot") to:

¢ reveal differences in distribution (prevalence) of demographic factors (eg, poverty,
ethnicity, insurance status) across ZIP codes.

¢ identify variables correlated (associated) with obesity risk (eg, poverty is more prevalent
