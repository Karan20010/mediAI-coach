(Choice C) Medicare is a federal health insurance program for patients who are age >65,

disabled, or have end-stage renal disease.

(Choice D) Point-of-service (POS) plans are similar to HMOs in that they require patients to
have a primary care provider and obtain referrals for specialty consultations. However, unlike
an HMO, patients may also see out-of-network providers. POS plans typically have higher
premiums than HMOs and significant costs if patients choose to see out-of-network specialists.

(Choice E) Preferred provider organization (PPO) plans usually offer the most flexible choices
for both in-network and out-of-network providers. However, PPOs typically have higher
premiums and deductibles than HMO plans.

Educational objective:

A health maintenance organization (HMO) is an insurance plan with low monthly premiums,
low copayments and deductibles, and low total cost for the patient. HMOs reduce utilization by
confining patients to a limited panel of providers, requiring referral from a primary care provider
prior to specialist consultations, and denying payment for services that do not meet
established guidelines.
