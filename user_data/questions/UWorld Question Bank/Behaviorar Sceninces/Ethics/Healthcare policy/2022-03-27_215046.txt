While this patient is undergoing emergency treatment for acute myocardial infarction, a woman
who claims to be his wife arrives at the hospital and asks about his medical condition. The
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is designed to protect patient
privacy. This requires the patient's explicit consent (or lack of objection when given the

opportunity) to share medical information with others, including family and friends.

When the patient is incapacitated or is not present, basic information can be shared if, in
the physician's professional judgment, doing so is in the patient's best interest. In this case,
there is no way of knowing for sure whether informing this woman (whether she is his wife or
not) is in the patient's best interest. However, the woman is distressed, and leaving her to
worry for an extended period while the patient is recovering could cause the patient emotional
harm if she is indeed family. The best approach to protect the patient's privacy is to explain
that he is stable, but that further information (including general diagnostic and treatment
information) cannot be shared until he is asked for and provides consent.

(Choice A) This discussion would violate the patient's privacy.

(Choices B and D) This patient has not given permission to release information to the
presumed wife, even if she provides identification or marital status is confirmed. For instance,
the patient could be undergoing a contentious divorce and not want any information released
