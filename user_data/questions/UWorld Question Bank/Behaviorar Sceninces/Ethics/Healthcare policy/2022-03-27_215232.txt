Physicians have an ethical responsibility to protect patient confidentiality, including during
interactions with other healthcare team members in public places and non-medical settings.
In situations where discussion of patient's healthcare information may be overheard, it is

it

prudent to avoid discussing any information regarding potential patients. Physicians should
maintain strict standards of confidentiality in any public setting, including in the presence of
other health care professionals not involved in the patient's care.

In this case, although the medical student has not used the patient's name, the room number
can easily be connected to the patient by anyone who may overhear, thereby violating the
patient's privacy under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The
most advisable course of action is to defer the conversation to a more appropriate and
private setting outside the elevator.

(Choice A) Although this statement is correct, publicly admonishing the student is not the best
approach. Discussing the matter privately during signout is preferred.
(Choices B, C, E, and F) These responses violate patient privacy as they acknowledge that

the patient received a CT scan. Disclosing information about a patient's hospital course in a
public setting, even if the patient's name is not discussed, is inappropriate.
