of a large multi-specialty medical group, which he joined less than a year ago after completing
residency. During the presentation, the physician discusses the various medical specialties
available within the group, as well as the range of ancillary services the group offers at its
facilities. In the ensuing discussion, the physician learns that the employer has been facing
financial difficulties. The employer wishes to continue offering health care coverage to its

methods best describes this type of health care financing arrangement?

©) A. Capitation
