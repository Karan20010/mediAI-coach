(Choice C) Although all patients have the right to a second opinion, explicitly stating this
option is not a requirement of the informed consent process.

(Choice E) Discussing the risks of anesthetic agents is outside the surgeon's scope of
practice. This should be discussed during the informed consent process with the
anesthesiologist, which is typically conducted as part of the preanesthesia evaluation.

Educational objective:

The essential components of informed consent include explanation of the patient's diagnosis

treatment, and the risks of refusing the proposed treatment.
