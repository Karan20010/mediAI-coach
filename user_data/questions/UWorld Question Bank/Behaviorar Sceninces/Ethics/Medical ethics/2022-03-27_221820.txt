(Choice B) Although explaining how knowing the diagnosis may help the patient make
subsequent treatment decisions, doing so prematurely without inquiring about the patient's
reasoning may pressure the patient to acquiesce to the physician's desire, which does not
respect the patient's autonomy.

(Choice D) This response normalizes the tendency to avoid receiving bad news, but it makes
the unfounded assumption that not knowing will cause more anxiety than bad news for this
particular patient.

(Choice E) This response respects the patient's autonomy but is dismissive and excludes
future collaborative treatment planning. The physician should attempt to understand the
patient's perspective and address his concerns.

Educational objective:

Patients have the right to have information withheld from them regarding their medical
condition. Physicians must respect their wish not to know but should also explore the patient
concerns to better understand their preferences and maximize their involvement in subsequent
medical decision-making.
