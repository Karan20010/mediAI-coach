A romantic or sexual relationship between a physician and a current patient (as in this
scenario) is always considered unethical due to potential exploitation and/or interference with
the physician's objective clinical judgment. Such a relationship may be ethically acceptable
provided the physician-patient relationship is terminated well before initiating a personal
relationship. However, it would also be inappropriate to suggest termination of the physician-
patient relationship solely for the purposes of dating, as physician-patient continuity is
associated with better patient outcomes; furthermore, the patient should not be forced to
choose between having the physician be a treatment provider or a romantic partner (Choices
C and F).

Of note, relationships between physicians and current or prior psychiatric patients are always
unethical due to the nature of evaluation and treatment, which include discussion of sensitive

information and recognition of psychological vulnerabilities.

(Choices A and B) Romantic and sexual relationships with current patients are unacceptable
regardless of who initiates them or whether there is mutual interest.

(Choice E) This statement is unnecessarily critical and may make the patient feel
embarrassed or ashamed.
