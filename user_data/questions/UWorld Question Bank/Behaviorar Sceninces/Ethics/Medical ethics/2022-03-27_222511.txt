A 70-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of headaches. She has been having a
severe, persistent headache for the past 2 weeks that is worse in the morning and always
lingers throughout the day. The patient frequently feels nauseated but has no vomiting.
Medical history is significant for major depressive disorder and a prior suicide attempt at age
45; the patient is currently taking an antidepressant and has been in remission for the past
year. MRI of the head reveals a mass with surrounding edema in the left cerebral hemisphere
that is consistent with glioblastoma multiforme. The patient returns to the office with her son to
discuss the results. Before the physician has a chance to share the findings, the son asks to
speak in private and requests that the physician not reveal the results to his mother. Which of
the following is the most appropriate response to the patient's son?

©) A. "Although it will be difficult to hear the diagnosis, | think it's best if your mother
knows so that she can make her own decisions about care."

(©) B. "Given your mother's history, it makes sense that you would want to minimize
stress; I'll share the results with you, and you can decide whether to tell her."

(©) C."l appreciate you sharing this with me; I'd like to hear more about why you prefer
that your mother not know about the results."
