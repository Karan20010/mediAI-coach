The process of informed consent requires disclosure of key information so that the patient can
make an informed medical decision. The essential components of an informed consent
discussion include explanation of the patient's diagnosis and proposed treatment, other
treatment options, risks and benefits of the proposed treatment, and risks of refusing the
proposed treatment. In this case, the surgeon has not yet addressed the risks to the patient
if the surgery is not performed (eg, increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular events).

The informed consent discussion should be conducted by the surgeon who will perform the
procedure and should use language that is easily comprehended. The patient must be given
an opportunity to ask questions. The content of the informed consent discussion should be
documented in the patient's medical record.

(Choice A) Information regarding cost is not a required component of informed consent. This
information likely depends on the patient's insurance plan and is not a question the physician
can accurately answer.

(Choice B) Disclosure of the mortality rate of a procedure performed by the surgeon is not a
required element of informed consent. However, if asked, a physician must answer truthfully
and disclose this information.
