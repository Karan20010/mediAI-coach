responsibility to systematically gather all the facts and arrange for a comprehensive

assessment and intervention if necessary.

(Choice B) The physician confronted the colleague with no response, and harm can still be
done to a patient in 30 minutes. A claim of confronting a colleague is not a substitute for
reporting the incident.

(Choices C and D) Witnessing the physician's on-duty intoxicated behavior is sufficient
reason to intervene as patient care may be in jeopardy. Whether there is direct evidence of
harm or the physician has an established pattern of problem behavior is irrelevant.

Educational objective:

Physicians are ethically and legally obligated to report impaired colleagues in a timely manner.
Reporting protects patient safety and can assist the impaired physician in receiving
appropriate evaluation and treatment.
