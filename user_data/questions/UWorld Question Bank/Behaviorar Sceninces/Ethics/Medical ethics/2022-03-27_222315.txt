concerns (eg, by providing nonmedication options).

(Choices A and C) This patient does not have ADHD; therefore, treatment with either
psychotherapy or a nonstimulant ADHD medication are not appropriate. Providing either
management option is not acting in the best interest of the patient.

(Choice B) Although it is appropriate to explain to the patient that a stimulant is not indicated,
the defensive tone of suggesting another opinion "if you do not agree" harms rapport and can
limit the willingness of the patient to hear recommendations.

(Choice E) Stating that the patient does not have ADHD is appropriate; however,
recommending that the patient schedule a follow-up visit only if the symptoms worsen is
dismissive of the patient's concern and suggests prolonged suffering is acceptable.

Educational objective:

Medical decision-making often involves balancing conflicting ethical principles (ie, autonomy,
beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice). While recognizing patients' rights to make personal
health care decisions (ie, autonomy), the provider has the responsibility to use specialized
training to incorporate the best interests of the patient into the provision of care (ie,
beneficence), which includes limiting nonindicated interventions.
