Ideally, advance care planning should take place through a series of open-ended
conversations early in a patient's serious illness (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in
the context of a longitudinal patient-physician relationship. Patients without advance directives
at the time of hospital admission should be provided with information and venues for learning
about and completing this process.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) Each of these components should be addressed during the
patient's hospitalization course and discharge planning process. However, they do not need to
be completed during admission. In contrast, discussion and documentation of a patient's
advance care status must be completed during admission because unexpected clinical
deterioration can occur at any time.

Educational objective:

The admission process must include discussion of whether the patient has advance directives,
along with code status, to ensure that medical personnel adhere to the patient's specific
wishes should the patient become incapacitated.
