Ethical dilemmas frequently arise in the provision of patient care because basic ethical
principles (ie, autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice) can often conflict with each
other.

This patient comes to the office for evaluation of difficulty concentrating, but the specific
concentration is limited to a single setting in a nonpersistent manner. In addition, he has no
evidence of hyperactivity or impulsivity; therefore, the patient does not meet the criteria for
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, despite this lack of diagnosis, this
patient still requests ADHD treatment with a stimulant medication, which has a risk of adverse

effects, including use disorder.

In this case, the right of the patient to make personal health care decisions (ie, autonomy)
conflicts with acting in the best interest of the patient (ie, beneficence), in particular the
avoidance of unnecessary, potentially harmful interventions (ie, nonmaleficence). The
patient's right to make personal health care decisions does not extend to dictating the
physician's recommendations; therefore, the physician should state why the medication is not
recommended to avoid potentially harmful interventions while also validating the patient's
concerns (eg, by providing nonmedication options).
