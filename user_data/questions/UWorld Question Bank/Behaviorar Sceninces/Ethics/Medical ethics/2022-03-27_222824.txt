Question Id: 10534

A 74-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by ambulance. She is
accompanied by a friend, who found the patient confused and disoriented lying on the floor in
her apartment. The patient is widowed and lives with her adult daughter. She was diagnosed
with aplastic anemia a year ago. Her condition has responded poorly to immunosuppressive
therapy and has required multiple blood transfusions. The patient is febrile, disoriented, and
unable to respond to questions. Complete blood count shows severe pancytopenia. The
patient has an advance directive, signed 9 months ago, in which she designated the friend as
her health care proxy. The friend tells the physician that the patient did not want to undergo
any further blood transfusions. The patient's daughter arrives and adamantly insists that the
patient receive a blood transfusion, saying, "| discussed it with my mother a few weeks ago,
and we decided that she should have everything done to prolong her life." Which of the
following is the most appropriate next step in patient care?

©) A. Contact the ethics committee for guidance because transfusion is not an emergency

©) B. Honor the daughter's wishes because she lives with the mother and knows her
better

() C. Honor the daughter's wishes, since she is the legal next of kin
