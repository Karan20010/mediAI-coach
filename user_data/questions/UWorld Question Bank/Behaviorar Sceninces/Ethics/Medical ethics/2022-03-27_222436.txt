Question Id: 2057

Minors (age <18) usually require parental consent for medical treatment; however, consent
is generally not required in the following situations:

¢ Legal or situational emancipation (eg, parent, married)
¢ Emergency care in which delay of care could result in significant harm to life or limb

¢ Specific conditions (eg, sexually transmitted infection [STI], pregnancy, substance abuse)
that are potentially serious, sensitive, or stigmatizing

Allowing minors to consent for treatment of certain potentially serious medical conditions (eg,
STI) encourages them to seek services without concern of parental involvement, as in this
patient's situation. In most states, minors can also consent to substance abuse and mental
health treatment as well as reproductive services, although there may be variations among
states (eg, requiring minors to be a minimum age). Some, but not all states, also exclude
information about sensitive services from insurance documentation that is sent to the parent
(policyholder).

(Choice A) Notification of parents for STIs other than HIV is not mandated in any state.

(Choices B and E) The patient can obtain evaluation and treatment for STIs, including

antibiotics, without parental notification or consent.
