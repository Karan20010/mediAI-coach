(Choice C) A patient cannot be hospitalized involuntarily on the basis of a diagnosis of
schizophrenia. Criteria for involuntary hospitalization include dangerousness to self or others
or grave disability/inability to care for self.

(Choice D) Anext of kin can act only as surrogate decision-maker if the patient is assessed
as lacking decision-making capacity.

(Choice E) The right to refuse treatment requires intact decision-making capacity. A decision-
specific capacity assessment should be performed before accepting the patient's refusal of
surgery.

Educational objective:

A diagnosis of schizophrenia, by itself, is not a reason to assume a patient lacks decision-
making capacity. A capacity assessment should be performed prior to treatment and includes
the ability to understand information, appreciate potential consequences, communicate a
choice, and offer a rationale.
