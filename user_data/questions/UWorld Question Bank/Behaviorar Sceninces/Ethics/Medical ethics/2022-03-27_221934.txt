Confidentiality is a basic tenet of medical ethics and a prerequisite for a trusting physician-
patient relationship. Physicians are ethically obligated to protect patient privacy and
maintain confidentiality in most situations, including during interactions with other
physicians who are not directly involved in the patient's medical care. This includes
colleagues who may share an office or group practice but who are not part of the patient's
immediate treatment team.

The gynecologist's inquiry into this patient's condition is based on personal (eg, close friend to
the patient's parents) and not professional interest or medical necessity. Therefore, the
physician cannot divulge any information regarding this patient's condition or treatment
because the gynecologist is not directly involved in, or necessary to, the patient's medical
care. Doing so would be a breach of patient privacy.

(Choices B, C, D, and E) Though these statements do not share details of the patient's
condition, they insinuate that she has a medical diagnosis, specifically one that is
"unexpected" and/or poor (eg, "she's had a pretty tough week"). Such statements would be
violations of the patient's privacy. In addition, they encourage the colleague to follow up with
the patient personally (eg, "you should ask her"), which is inappropriate because the patient
may not wish to share her diagnosis or receive support from others at this time.
