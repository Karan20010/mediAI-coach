This patient is unable to communicate his wishes regarding his care and does not have a
prepared statement of his wishes (ie, advance directive) or designated surrogate decision-
maker (eg, durable power of attorney). In such cases, decision-making falls to the next of kin
(also called default surrogate). The order of next of kin is determined by the proximity of
relationship; in most jurisdictions, priority goes to the patient's spouse, adult children,
parents, and adult siblings, sequentially.

The next of kin is responsible for making decisions based on what they believe the patient
would want (ie, substituted judgment) and the patient's best interest. In this case, the
patient's wife indicates that he had expressed his wishes not to be resuscitated (ie, basic life
support [rescue breathing, chest compressions], advanced cardiac life support [ACLS]
[mechanical ventilation, defibrillation]).

Therefore, in case of ventricular fibrillation or another malignant arrhythmia, this patient should
not be resuscitated. Comfort measures should be provided as appropriate, and staff should
avoid disrupting the family's final moments with the patient.

(Choice B) As next of kin, the patient's wife has the authority to make decisions for the
patient. Nothing in this case suggests inadequate or insincere decision-making by the wife,
and her decisions should be respected.
