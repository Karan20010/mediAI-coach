stating that an error occurred, omitting details or potential causes). Evidence suggests that
early, full disclosure of errors is associated with fewer malpractice lawsuits (possibly because
disclosure may increase patient trust in the provider).

(Choices A and D) Although these statements include a clear apology, they do not include
discussion of steps that can be taken to minimize consequences (eg, waiving charges) or
prevent future occurrences.

(Choice B) Although the patient has autonomy to transfer care elsewhere following an error,
attempts should first be made to encourage continuation of the therapeutic relationship and
reestablish trust. Moreover, as the physician was not directly involved in the error, apologizing

on behalf of the team is more appropriate.

(Choice E) Although staff inexperience may be a contributing factor in this error, it is likely that
other systems factors (eg, tracking, staffing schedules) also played a role. Therefore,
implicating staff in the error is premature without further investigation.

Educational objective:
Physicians have an ethical responsibility to disclose errors caused by system failures to
patients. Full disclosure includes providing details of the error and why it happened and

explaining steps to minimize consequences and prevent future occurrences.
