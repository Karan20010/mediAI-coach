fluids and an insulin drip, and laboratory testing is ordered. In the morning, the on-call
physician hands off the patient to the day shift physician, who arrives an hour late due to an
emergency at his nighttime moonlighting job. The handoff information includes the status of
the patient and instructions to check electrolytes and calculate his anion gap. The physician
performs inpatient rounds and then sees his usual clinic outpatients in the afternoon, but he
neglects to check the patient's anion gap. The patient subsequently develops worsening
acidosis requiring intubation for respiratory distress. Which of the following is the most likely
cause of this adverse outcome?

©) A. Deficiency of knowledge
() B. Excessive patient caseload
©) C. Inadequate patient handoff
