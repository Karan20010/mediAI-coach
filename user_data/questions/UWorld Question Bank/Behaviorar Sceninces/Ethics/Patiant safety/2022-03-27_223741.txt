Hypothyroidism is a known cause of depression and is routinely screened for with a TSH
level. This patient's elevated level (normal: 0.5-5.0 uU/mL) should have been detected during

a hospitalization and prompted further workup. The inpatient physician's failure to note and

address the abnormality is a preventable medical error that resulted in delayed diagnosis.
Preventable medical errors involve harm to the patient by an act of commission or omission
rather than from the underlying disease and are the result of failure to follow evidence-based
best practice guidelines.

(Choice A) Malpractice is a legal determination; it involves situations in which the treatment
provided is below the accepted standard of practice and has resulted in injury or death to the
patient. It is not a category of medical error but rather refers to the consequence of many
different types of errors that result in harm.

(Choice B) Anear miss is a medical error that is recognized before any harm is done to the
patient (eg, a patient is prescribed a lethal dose of medication, but the error is caught by the
pharmacist). In contrast, the patient in this case has been harmed by the delay in appropriate

diagnosis and treatment.

(Choice C) This error would have been prevented if the physician had adhered to the

standard of care. Anon-preventable adverse event is a complication that cannot be prevented
