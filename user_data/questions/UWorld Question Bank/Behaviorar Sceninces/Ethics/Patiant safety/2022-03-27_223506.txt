A medical intern is working on the inpatient wards at a busy community hospital. During
rounds, the team evaluates a new patient admitted for worsening congestive heart failure. The
patient's past medical history includes atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, diabetes
mellitus, and pulmonary hypertension. Current medications include metformin, aspirin, and
enalapril. On previous admissions, the patient admitted to using cocaine recreationally with
friends and admits to the intern that his last use was today. The attending physician asks the
intern to start the patient on propranolol for his heart condition; he will be expected to continue
this medication following hospital discharge. After rounds, the intern recalls that during
medical school she learned that beta adrenergic antagonists can interact poorly with cocaine.
Which of the following actions by the intern is most appropriate?

©) A. Administer the drug as the attending physician has likely considered the risks and
benefits of a beta blocker in combination with cocaine

©) B. Discuss concerns with the nurses, ask for their input, and have them monitor the
patient's vital signs when starting the medication

©) C. Discuss the risks and benefits of the medication with the patient and let him decide
