New patient visits should always include a thorough review of current medications (including
over-the-counter medications) to determine if any are inappropriate and/or causing adverse
effects or problematic drug-drug interactions. The risk of adverse drug events increases with
the number of medications, and minimizing the use of non-essential medications can reduce
the risk of an adverse event. This patient is likely experiencing anticholinergic side effects (ie,
urinary retention, constipation) due to the combined anticholinergic effects of amitriptyline and
diphenhydramine. Anticholinergic side effects are particularly common in older adults and can
also include impaired memory, confusion, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, impaired
sweating, tachycardia, and increased risk for falls. Physicians should prioritize discontinuing
unnecessary medications prior to pursuing further workup or adding additional medications for
chronic problems. In this case, diphenhydramine should be discontinued as it is highly
anticholinergic and has not helped with the patient's chronic insomnia.

(Choice A) Although topiramate can be considered for migraine prevention, discontinuing
unnecessary medication that is causing adverse effects takes priority.

(Choice B) Zolpidem is a pharmacological treatment option for insomnia but should not be
added to the patient's regimen as it has adverse effects in older adults, including increased
risk of falls and confusion. Non-pharmacological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy)
