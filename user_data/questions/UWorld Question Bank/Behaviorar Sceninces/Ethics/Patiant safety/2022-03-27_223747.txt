(Choice C) This error would have been prevented if the physician had adhered to the
standard of care. Anon-preventable adverse event is a complication that cannot be prevented
given the current state of medical knowledge (eg, an allergic reaction to a medication in a
patient with no known history of drug allergies).

(Choice E) Asentinel event is an unexpected occurrence involving death or serious physical
or psychological injury (eg, inpatient suicide, death of a full-term infant, retained object after
surgery) that requires immediate investigation.

Educational objective:
A preventable adverse event is defined as injury to a patient due to failure to follow evidence-
based best practice guidelines.
