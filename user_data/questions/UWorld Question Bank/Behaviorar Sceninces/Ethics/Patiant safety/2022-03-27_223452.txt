In the hospital setting, multiple providers will assume responsibility for a patient's care at
different times of the day, which can result in discontinuity of care. As a result, patients are at
higher risk of adverse outcomes when providers do not communicate well during transitions.
The process of transferring responsibility for medical care is referred to as a patient handoff,
with "sign-out" referring to the process of transmitting information about the patient and
needed follow-up care. Oversights and communication failures during the sign-out and
handoff process have been linked to adverse events in a range of hospital settings. Omission
of key information during handoffs can result in medication errors, avoidable escalations in
care (eg, transfer to the intensive care unit), redundancies in care, and delays in diagnosis or
treatment.

Standardized handoffs that include specified key elements (eg, a systematic procedure for
sign-out, checklists of tasks that need to be completed) have been shown to significantly
reduce preventable adverse events.

(Choices A and B) Reducing patient caseloads and increasing the frequency of team
meetings to discuss critically ill patients can both provide more time for physicians to
communicate patient care information. However, these interventions would not ensure that
critical information is transmitted consistently between providers.
