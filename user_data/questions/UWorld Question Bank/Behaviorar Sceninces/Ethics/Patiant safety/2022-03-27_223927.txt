this case.

(Choice E) Physician burnout refers to a state of emotional exhaustion, cynicism,
depersonalization, and decreased sense of personal accomplishment that can result in
suboptimal patient care and medical errors. Although sleep deprivation may contribute to
burnout, there is no evidence that this physician's error was secondary to burnout, which often
involves errors resulting from lack of concern or callousness toward patients rather than
forgetfulness.

Educational objective:

Sleep deprivation in physicians often causes cognitive impairment, resulting in medical errors.
Although mandated resident work-hour limitations are in place, it is the responsibility of all
physicians to self-regulate their workloads to promote patient safety.
