Interns on a medical team should not blindly follow the orders of attending physicians or
physicians who have more seniority. As part of the educational process, it is essential to
understand the clinical reasoning behind team members’ decisions. It is in the best
interest of both the intern and the patient to resolve potential problems before proceeding.
This concept applies to the relationship between residents and attending physicians,
physicians working in parallel (eg, anesthesiologist and surgeon), and medical students and
other medical staff. The best approach is to respectfully discuss the issue directly with the
attending physician and inquire why the decision was made. In this case, the attending
physician may feel that the cardioprotective benefit of a beta-adrenergic antagonist outweighs
the potential risk of an interaction with cocaine.

(Choice A) It is unethical to blindly follow an order from an attending physician when there is
concern about safety and patient care. The best course of action is to discuss the issue with

the other physician and reach a consensus.

(Choice B) Although seasoned nurses will have acquired a considerable amount of medical
knowledge, it is not their job to decide between the differing opinions of 2 physicians. In
addition, administering a medication that could have an adverse reaction is problematic, even

if vital signs are being monitored.
