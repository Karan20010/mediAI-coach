nursing home patients who are physically restrained.

(Choices B and E) Assistive devices such as canes and walkers are often used to improve
mobility in patients with gait or balance disturbances. However, there is a lack of evidence
regarding their efficacy in preventing falls (they may impair compensatory stepping reactions
that help with balance recovery).

Educational objective:

Falls are a common problem in elderly nursing home patients. Optimal management includes
a careful medication review with the goal of limiting the use of agents associated with
increased fall risk.
