3 immediate safety is not at risk.

(Choice B) There is sufficient evidence to suspect physical abuse and neglect, requiring that
CPS be notified for further intervention. Asking about daytime supervision sidesteps the abuse
and neglect, which is the most important issue to address. Regardless of whether the mother
or another daytime caregiver is the offender, this situation warrants CPS involvement.

(Choice C) Calling security and insisting that the mother leave the room are indicated if there
is an immediate risk to the child. This patient has a suspicious examination finding and has
already disclosed sufficient evidence of possible abuse, justifying CPS involvement; it is
unnecessary to interview him alone, which would unreasonably risk escalating the parent's
reaction, prior to contacting CPS.

(Choice E) Openly doubting the mother's explanation will likely be met with denial, and
confrontationally challenging caregivers is risky because they may become violent or attempt
to flee the emergency department. It is therefore preferable to contact CPS if there are
concerns for child abuse.

Educational objective:
Physicians are obligated to report suspected child abuse or neglect to child protective services

(CPS) for further investigation. Reporting is mandatory, and reasonable suspicion is sufficient
