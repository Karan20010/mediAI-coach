This patient's medical history and examination indicate several signs concerning for elder
neglect and possible exploitation. The patient's son sold her house, is not at home most
days, and is difficult to contact. He has neglected to assist the patient in picking up her
prescriptions or drive her places, forcing her to rely on neighbors for help. Her physical
examination is remarkable for elevated blood pressure (likely due to not taking lisinopril) and

her tattered clothing may also be an indication of neglect.

Healthcare professionals who care for the elderly have a legal and ethical obligation to
intervene when elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation (collectively, elder mistreatment) are
suspected. Physicians should be alert for signs of elder mistreatment, including evidence of
neglect, deterioration in medical conditions and malnutrition, atypical injuries, and behavioral
changes (eg, depression, anxiety). The next step in management is to report suspected
mistreatment to Adult Protective Services, which can investigate the situation with home
visits, initiate review of financial records to identify victims of financial exploitation, and assist in
mobilizing resources (eg, assistance with prescriptions and transportation to appointments,
home care services).

(Choices A and D) Although home healthcare services and an in-home social work
assessment may be helpful for this patient, investigation for elder mistreatment takes priority.
