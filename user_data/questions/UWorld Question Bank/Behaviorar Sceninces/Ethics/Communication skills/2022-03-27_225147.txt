This patient requires surgical intervention and must give appropriate consent before
proceeding. However, he has limited English proficiency (LEP) and will require language
assistance to make informed decisions about his health care. Best practices for medical
communication with a patient who has LEP is to use an interpreter (or provider) trained in
medical translation in the patient's primary language. Using a trained medical interpreter
can help avoid potentially dangerous miscommunication, and leads to fewer clinical errors,
higher patient satisfaction, and better clinical outcomes. However, using an interpreter or other
personnel to provide care is subject to consent by the patient.

If a face-to-face interpreter is unavailable, video or telephonic remote translation services
should be offered. If the situation is urgent and there is no time to wait for interpretation
services, communication should be facilitated by any tools available (eg, friends/family,
writing/drawing instruments, bilingual hospital staff); however, these options should not be
considered standard procedure in nonemergency situations.

However, it does not replace the need for a medical interpreter who can provide details of the
procedure and guarantee that the patient's questions are answered thoroughly.

(Choices C and D) Friends and family members are not ideal for language interpretation due
