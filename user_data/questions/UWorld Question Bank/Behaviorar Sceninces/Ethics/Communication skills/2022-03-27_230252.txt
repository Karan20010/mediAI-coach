(Choice B) This statement reflects empathy for the patient's suffering but is fear based (ie,
focuses on negative consequences). It is unlikely to promote acceptance in a patient whose
reason for refusing surgery is low trust; in fact, the patient could perceive this statement as
coercive or threatening.

(Choice C) This question assumes that the patient's refusal is based on financial concerns;
her statement is more indicative of distrust.

(Choice E) Attributing this patient's response to pain ignores her central concern of trust and
may be viewed as condescending.

Educational objective:

Trust is central to the physician-patient relationship, and distrust may arise from prior negative
experiences (eg, adverse events, bias). Physicians can build trust by identifying shared goals,
seeking patient perspectives, and prioritizing patient-centered care.
