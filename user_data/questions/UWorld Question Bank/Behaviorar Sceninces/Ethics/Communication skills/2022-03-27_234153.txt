no obligation to hear the results of an intervention and has the right to refuse procedures or
information at any time.

informed should be respected. Questioning the patient's decision and consulting with the
chaplain or the patient's son are not necessary and may be perceived as disrespectful.

clearly stated that he does not want to know.
