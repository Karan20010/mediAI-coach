Patient-centered communication involves being responsive to the patient's perspective.
Initial interactions are particularly important because they set the foundation for the physician-
patient relationship. Acknowledging the patient's perspective and being respectful,
nondefensive, and nonjudgmental are important for developing rapport and fostering the
physician-patient relationship.

In this scenario, the patient is upset because he waited 2 hours and missed work, which is
compounded by his perception that the wait was avoidable. The best approach is to offer a
straightforward apology for the delay, instead of attempting to justify it, and then focus on the
reason for the visit. This response keeps the focus on the patient's needs and perspective.

(Choice B) This response attempts to justify why the waiting room is empty rather than
acknowledging the impact of the delay on the patient. It is likely to be perceived as defensive

and does not foster the physician-patient relationship.

(Choices C and D) These responses assume that the patient's condition is not serious or
urgent. They may also convey that the patient's concerns are being given lower priority and
insinuate that the patient made a mistake in coming to an urgent care clinic. A patient who is
already frustrated is likely to experience these comments as dismissive and judgmental.
