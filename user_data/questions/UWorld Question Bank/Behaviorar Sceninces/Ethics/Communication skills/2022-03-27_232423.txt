(Choice D) Although it is appropriate to explain that unnecessary antibiotic use can contribute
to general antibiotic resistance, this response is not patient centered because it dismisses the
patient's concerns and does not explain why antibiotics are inappropriate for his specific
symptoms.

any treatment options. It may be perceived as invalidating or judgmental and have a
detrimental effect on the physician-patient relationship.

Educational objective:

Empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with uncomplicated upper respiratory infections is
contraindicated. Responding to requests for inappropriate antibiotics involves a patient-
centered approach that validates the patient's concerns, educates the patient about the
adverse effects of antibiotics and their lack of efficacy in treating viral infections, and provides
options to treat the patient symptomatically.
