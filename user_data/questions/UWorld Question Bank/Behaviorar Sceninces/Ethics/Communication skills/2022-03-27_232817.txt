Question Id: 19842

Communicating the news of a suspected diagnosis of Down syndrome (DS) at the time of
delivery requires an empathic approach that is responsive to the parent's emotional needs
and avoids negative bias about the diagnosis. Parents should be informed of the diagnosis
as soon as possible in a private setting that allows them time to process the news, express
their emotions, and ask any questions they may have. Initiating the discussion with
statements that frame the diagnosis negatively (eg, "I'm sorry," "| have bad news") should be
avoided because they convey implicit bias that the intellectual disability associated with DS is
devastating, which may not reflect the parents’ values or views about their child. A shift from
"breaking bad news" to "sharing unexpected news" can help prepare the parents to receive the
information without imposing negative value judgments.

Detailed information about the diagnosis should be tailored to the parents' knowledge base
and how much they want to know at this point in time. The physician should provide
information about local resources and support groups and make a plan for follow-up
discussion.

(Choice A) This statement uses medical jargon to deliver life-changing news without warning.
Parents should be prepared that unexpected news is coming, and the physician should use
language that is easily understood.
