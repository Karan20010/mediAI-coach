challenge the patient's story (eg, "I'm concerned they were caused by someone else") or are
overly abrupt and directive (eg, "you need to tell me about the bruises"), approaches that risk
the patient becoming defensive, undermining the possibility for intervention.

(Choices D and E) Although there is valid concern for abuse, unfounded assumptions should
be avoided. If IPV is confirmed, immediate safety should be addressed at that time, followed
by development of a safety plan. Value judgments (eg, "No one deserves..."), unless
originating from the patient, should not be used during this process so as to avoid
unintentionally alienating the patient.

Educational objective:

Routine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) includes the use of direct questioning
(eg, "Have you ever been hit by your partner?") to encourage disclosure. However, patients
with suspected active IPV (eg, multiple bruises) may be less forthcoming and require indirect
questioning (eg, "How are things going at home?").
