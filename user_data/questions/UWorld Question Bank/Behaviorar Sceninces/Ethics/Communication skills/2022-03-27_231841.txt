When patients & families request that "everything" be done

Understand what
“everything” means

¢ "Every treatment with even the slightest possibility of
benefit" (rare)

"Everything that you, as my physician, feel is
worthwhile"

"Everything to relieve symptoms, even though it may
shorten life"

Communicate prognosis

Use clear & direct language ("Your mother is dying")
¢ Maintain consistent messaging

Avoid discussing minutiae of management

Propose a philosophy of
treatment

Offer medical recommendations with appropriate limits
to therapy

¢ Discuss what will be done before covering what will not
be done

Illustrate how the recommendations support the
patient's values
