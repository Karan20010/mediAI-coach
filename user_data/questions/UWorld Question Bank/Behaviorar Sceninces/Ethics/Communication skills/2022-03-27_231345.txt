This physician is confronted by a patient who has not experienced benefit from previous
treatment and feels hopeless that his condition will improve. Such challenging patients can
often cause the physician to feel defensive, manipulated, or hopeless as well, leading to
premature referral to a specialist.

Although strategies to improve treatment adherence will be important for improving outcomes,
the best initial approach is to build the physician-patient relationship by empathizing with
the patient's frustration and disappointment with past treatments. In this way, the patient
will feel understood rather than blamed for past treatment failures, and he will be more willing
to work with the physician to develop a collaborative plan focused on realistic goals.

(Choice A) This patient requires a thorough history and physical examination to assess his
condition. Referral to a pain specialist is premature.

(Choice B) This statement is likely to be experienced as unsupportive because it challenges
the patient's proposal regarding disability and does not offer any suggestions in its place.

(Choice C) This statement attempts to point out the patient's help-rejecting pattern of
behavior, but it would likely be perceived as judgmental, especially at this early stage of the
physician-patient relationship.
