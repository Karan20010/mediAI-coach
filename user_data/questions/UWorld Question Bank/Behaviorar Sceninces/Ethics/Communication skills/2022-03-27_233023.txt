This patient recently experienced a myocardial infarction and expresses concern about having
another one. He identifies a number of issues he feels he should address to reduce his risk
(eg, stop smoking, lose weight, start exercising). Like many patients, he faces multiple health
challenges and has specific life circumstances that influence his priorities (eg, high-pressure
job). Rather than developing an exhaustive list of changes, helping the patient focus on 1 or
2 specific behaviors he feels most ready to change is more productive. In motivational
interviewing, this is referred to as the process of focusing.

A patient-centered, collaborative approach is important; the physician should elicit the patient's
thoughts and feelings about what to focus on. Rather than giving advice without permission,
unilaterally setting the agenda, or overwhelming the patient with a long list of changes, the
physician can help the patient focus on realistic changes he is more likely to pursue.

(Choice A) This statement prematurely assumes the patient is internally motivated to
change. It describes the patient as committed to these goals when he said only that he
"should" do all those things. This response also may overwhelm the patient because it fails to
help him focus on realistic goals.

(Choice B) This is an example of noncollaborative agenda-setting. It is less likely to be
effective than eliciting the patient's perspective.
