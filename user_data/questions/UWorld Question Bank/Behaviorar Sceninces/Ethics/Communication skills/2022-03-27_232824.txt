language that is easily understood.

(Choices C and D) These statements are not neutral and frame the diagnosis negatively.
Initiating the discussion with "unexpected" rather than "bad" news is preferable.

(Choice E) Sharing alarming news that the baby's examination is abnormal and inquiring if
prenatal testing was done is insensitive and may be perceived as judgmental. When
characteristic dysmorphic features of DS are present, it is better to share the findings, explain
the diagnosis, and answer any questions the parents may have.

Educational objective:

Communicating the news of a suspected diagnosis of Down syndrome at the time of delivery
requires an empathic approach. A shift from "breaking bad news" to "sharing unexpected
news" can help prepare the parents to receive the information without imposing negative value
judgments.
