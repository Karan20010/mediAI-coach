interventions could be considered if her blood pressure remained poorly controlled despite
medication adherence.

(Choice B) Reviewing the patient's regimen and offering suggestions on how to improve
adherence would be premature without first understanding the patient's perspective and
exploring her specific concerns about taking her medication.

(Choice E) If the patient seemed reluctant to discuss her medication usage with her husband
in the room, the physician might suggest that they speak with her husband not present. There
is no evidence to suggest that this is necessary at this time.

(Choice F) Although assessing the patient's understanding of hypertension is important in
providing targeted education, this statement aligns the physician with the husband rather than
with the patient. She may feel attacked, which could put her on the defensive.

Educational objective:

Identifying and managing nonadherence is critical to improving outcomes for many chronic
conditions, including hypertension. Creating an alliance by validating the patient's perspective
and using an open-ended, nonjudgmental question is the most effective way to initiate a

discussion.
