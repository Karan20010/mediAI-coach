Once the psychosocial aspects of treatment are addressed, weight loss counseling is likely to

(Choice C) This patient's frustrations pertain to diabetes and insulin. Once that issue is
addressed, if the patient has additional concerns or depressive symptoms in other domains, a
more detailed depression assessment could be performed.

(Choice D) This response conveys empathy but diverts attention from the patient to the

provider. Such a statement might be appropriate as a cheerful end to the conversation but is
not an effective way to initiate further discussion.

(Choice E) This patient's feelings of guilt may be related to his family background, but his
concerns focus specifically on his lifestyle habits and diabetic control rather than genetic
factors in the etiology of diabetes.

Educational objective:

Failure of oral medications is common in long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to
progressive loss of pancreatic beta cell function. Patients should be counseled that because
of the natural history of the condition, the need for supplemental insulin is common and does
not represent a personal failure.
