(Choice D) Suggesting that the patient should calm down is likely to be perceived as
condescending and judgmental, leading to further deterioration of rapport.

(Choice E) Suggesting referral to another provider may be perceived as an attempt to get rid
of the patient. The first step should be to defuse the patient's anger and attempt to preserve
the physician-patient relationship.

Educational objective:

When confronting an angry patient, the physician should use a nondefensive, empathic
approach that acknowledges the patient's anger and attempts to explore the patient's
underlying concerns.
