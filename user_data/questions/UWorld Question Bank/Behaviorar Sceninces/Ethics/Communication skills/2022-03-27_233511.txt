This deaf patient is communicating with health care providers using standardized American
Sign Language (ASL) via a surrogate, nonstandard gestures, lip reading, and handwritten
notes. However, in general, the most accurate and effective method of communication is to
use a medical interpreter (or provider) trained in ASL.

As with spoken languages, communicating medical information in ASL requires precise
wording and use of terminology that is not typically used by lay persons in daily
communication. Using a trained medical ASL interpreter can help to avoid potentially
dangerous miscommunication. As with any nonprovider personnel, the use of an ASL
interpreter is subject to patient preference and consent and should be offered to all deaf and
hard of hearing patients. If a face-to-face interpreter is unavailable, alternate modes of
communication include computer-assisted real-time transcription and assistive listening
devices.

(Choice A) Friends and family members are not preferred for interpretation due to lack of
impartiality, unfamiliarity with medical terminology, and possible barriers to open discussion of
sensitive topics (eg, domestic abuse). Even though this patient has used his friend to assist in
communication, this method should not be used unless the patient specifically requests it.
