normal limits and physical examination is unremarkable; urinalysis shows gross hematuria but
is otherwise normal. The physician discusses potential causes and the need for a cystoscopy.
The patient is told what to expect during the procedure and is given written information and a
referral list with instructions on how to schedule an appointment with a urologist. He anxiously
glances over the papers, saying he will make an appointment soon. Office staff had informed
the physician that the patient was unable to follow the directions on the sign-in sheet and
