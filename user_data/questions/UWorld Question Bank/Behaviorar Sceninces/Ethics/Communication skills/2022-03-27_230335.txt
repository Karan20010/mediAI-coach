(Choice D) This statement uses optimism and reassurance by changing the focus to recent
advances in treatment. This may have the unintended consequence of discouraging the
patient from expressing her emotions and fears about the illness. After acknowledging the
patient's emotions, it is preferable to gently explore how much she wants to know about the
diagnosis and treatment options at this point.

(Choice E) This response makes the inappropriate assumption that the patient is not ready or
does not want to receive additional information during this visit. Instead, the patient should be
allowed to express the full range of her emotions and invited to ask any questions. Depending
on her response, the physician can educate her about the condition and her options.

Educational objective:

Delivering serious news requires allowing the patient time to process the information and

express emotions. Empathic, supportive communication should include acknowledging the

patient's distress and being open to answering any questions.
