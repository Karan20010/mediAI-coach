(Choice B) Nursing home (ie, skilled care facility) transfer is appropriate for patients who
require technically advanced interventions (eg, dressing changes, intravenous antibiotics) that
cannot be provided at home. Postacute care for heart failure typically involves oral
medications that do not require skilled services.

(Choice C) Improper diet (eg, unrestricted sodium intake) is a common reason for heart
failure readmission. However, the clinician should first assess the patient's current level of
understanding, and the patient should be allowed to explain the reasons she thinks contribute
to readmission.

(Choice E) This patient has been clinically stabilized and is unlikely to benefit from continued
stay. Predischarge counseling should focus on factors at home that could lead to readmission
rather than on reasons to stay in the hospital.

Educational objective:

Predischarge counseling should begin with exploring patients’ level of understanding and
health literacy. Patients should have an opportunity to ask questions and express their
concerns about factors at home that could lead to readmission. If possible, education should
be provided by a multidisciplinary care team, and the plan for home care and follow-up should

be clear.
