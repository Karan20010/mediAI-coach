A 46-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of chronic fatigue, concentration
difficulties, and intermittent headaches for the past 8 months. The patient says, "I had to start
working part-time because I'm so tired and can't focus, especially when | have a headache."
She pulls out a folder with several case reports on rare presentations of systemic lupus
erythematosus and gives it to the physician. The patient says, "I Know this is what | have, and
‘ve included a list of all the immunological tests that you need to order." She has already been
to a few physicians for evaluation but felt they did not take her concerns seriously. Which of
the following is the most appropriate response to this patient's request?

© A. "Although there is some overlap between your symptoms and those of lupus, we
should first consider more common and likely causes."

© B. "It must be difficult to deal with these symptoms every day and feel like you're not
being listened to; have you been feeling anxious recently?”

©) C. "Thank you for sharing this information with me; however, the initial work-up for the
symptoms you're describing do not include these immunological tests."

©) D."You want an explanation for the symptoms you're experiencing; since this is our
first meeting, I'd like to do a thorough evaluation before we talk about testing.”
