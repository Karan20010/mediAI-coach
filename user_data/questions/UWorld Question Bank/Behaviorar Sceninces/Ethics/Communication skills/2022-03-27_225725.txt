Patients may ask various types of questions, from inquiries about the physician's professional
qualifications and experience to more personal questions about the physician's background
and life experiences (including age, marital status, children, and similar experiences such as
cancer, a particular medical diagnosis, and loss of a loved one). Some may be especially
curious to know personal details that relate to their own life struggles, often triggered by
unspoken hopes and fears about whether the physician will be able to help them.

Although being responsive to a patient's questions can enhance a trusting relationship,
physicians should not feel pressured to respond to questions that they find overly personal or
intrusive. However, physicians can maintain boundaries while also gently exploring why
the patient is asking. This approach can be helpful in gaining a deeper understanding of the
patient's concerns. Querying about what makes this patient ask the question may reveal
specific concerns about whether the physician understands her emotional pain and may allay
possible fears about psychotherapy. The physician can then more effectively support the
patient and address these concerns.

(Choice A) This response ignores the patient's question and attempts to provide general
reassurance. It would be more productive to try to identify and address the patient's specific
issues.
