be able to provide reassurance through patient-centered education.

(Choice A) Although the daughter's encouragement may be helpful, the physician should first
attempt to directly engage the patient.

(Choice B) Distrust in the medical system should be respectfully explored rather than viewed
as delusional, given its legitimate relation to historical events and personal experience.

(Choice D) Inquiring about the patient's understanding of federally funded health care
systems is less focused and relevant compared to direct discussion, exploration of views, and
reassurance regarding the influenza vaccination.

(Choice E) Although the patient has the right to ultimately decline vaccination, the physician
should first attempt to engage her with open-ended discussion about it.

Educational objective:

Trust is central to the provider-patient therapeutic alliance and is associated with improved
outcomes. Distrust by minority patients may result from numerous factors (eg, historical
legacy, experience of discrimination, low cultural inclusivity). Providers can build trust through

open-ended discussion and focused reassurance using culturally relevant materials.
