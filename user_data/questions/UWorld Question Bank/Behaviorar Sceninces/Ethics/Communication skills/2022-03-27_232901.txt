congestion. After waiting for 2 hours, he is taken to an examination room. Vital signs are

here." In addition to thanking the patient for waiting, which of the following initial responses by

the physician is most appropriate?

©) B. "| know the waiting room appears empty; the staff is working hard to see patients
efficiently."

|) C. "Unfortunately, the wait was so long because we triage patients based on urgency
and severity."

©) D. "Wait times are usually shorter at outpatient offices because urgent care clinics can
be unpredictable."
