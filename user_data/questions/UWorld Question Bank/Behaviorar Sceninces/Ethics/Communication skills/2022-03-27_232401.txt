resistance should be respected, and his internal motivation encouraged.

(Choice B) Although this response initially acknowledges the patient's perspective, it then
makes an assumption that may be experienced as judgmental. It would be better to
encourage an open-ended discussion about how the patient himself understands his alcohol

use.

(Choice D) This approach prematurely focuses on alternative behaviors without first
developing the patient's ambivalence about drinking and intrinsic motivation to make a
change. The patient should be encouraged to come up with possible alternative behaviors
himself rather than forcing suggestions on him.

(Choice E) Although this statement accurately reflects the patient's current lack of readiness
to make a change, it does not encourage discussion and prematurely terminates any efforts to
facilitate change.

Educational objective:

Motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach to help change maladaptive
behaviors; it matches strategies to the patient's stage of readiness to make a change. This
includes acknowledging the patient's resistance and developing the patient's own motivation to

change. Activate Windows
