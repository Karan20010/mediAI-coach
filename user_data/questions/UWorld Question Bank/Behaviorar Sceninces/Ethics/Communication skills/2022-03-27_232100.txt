Educational objective:

Ethnic minorities are more likely to be undertreated for pain, potentially due to physician bias
or suboptimal communication. Cross-cultural care can promote optimal pain management by
establishing the shared goal of patient well-being. This can be facilitated by exploring the
cultural values (eg, stoicism, deference) that influence patient perceptions of pain and comfort.
