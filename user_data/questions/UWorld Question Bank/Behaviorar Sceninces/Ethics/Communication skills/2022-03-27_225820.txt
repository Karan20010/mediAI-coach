Patients have the right to preemptively refuse to receive medical information. This patient
has expressed a clear preference and has the capacity to make health care decisions. It is
important to respect his wishes by withholding the information. In this case, respecting patient
autonomy means respecting his decision not to know and to defer decision-making to his son.

Reasons for refusing to receive medical information are varied and complex and include
personal values (eq, fatalism), psychological concerns (eg, fears of bad news and mortality),
and cultural beliefs (eg, cultural preference for the family to make treatment decisions). In
some cultures, direct disclosure of a serious illness to a family elder may be considered
unnecessarily cruel or disrespectful, and it is customary for family members to make health
care decisions for the patient. Other cultural reasons for nondisclosure include the belief that
open discussion may cause unnecessary anxiety, depression, or hopelessness or that
speaking aloud about a condition makes death or terminal illness more certain. Physicians
should respond to different individual and cultural values with an open, sensitive approach that

conveys respect for the preferences of the patient and family.

(Choice A) This statement may be perceived as judgmental and impair rapport. A patient has
no obligation to hear the results of an intervention and has the right to refuse procedures or

information at any time.
