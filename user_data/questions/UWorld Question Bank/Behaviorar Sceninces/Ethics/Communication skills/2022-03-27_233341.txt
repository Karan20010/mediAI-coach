and follow-up of type 1 diabetes mellitus. The patient appears irritated, and his mother begins
the visit by exclaiming, "Here's the doctor; he's going to tell you how badly you've been

doing." Laboratory tests show a random blood glucose of 350 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c of
9% (normal: <6%-7%). When the physician asks the patient how he is doing with his insulin,
