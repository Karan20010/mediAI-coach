A 33-year-old woman is transferred to the university medical center from a small community
hospital due to acute pyelonephritis with sepsis. She has a history of recurrent urinary tract
infections due to urinary retention related to a spinal cord injury in childhood. On arrival, the
patient is febrile and lethargic. She provides no additional history, and the only information
available is from poorly legible handwritten notes from the originating hospital. The patient is
admitted to the intensive care unit with orders to give imipenem and vancomycin. Overnight,
the patient develops a rash and severe respiratory distress requiring brief mechanical
ventilation. The following morning, a transcribed physician note from the originating hospital
arrives by fax and indicates that the patient has an allergy to multiple antibiotics, including
imipenem. When discussing events with the patient and her family, which of the following
statements is associated with reduced malpractice liability for the treating clinician?

(©) A. "As your attending physician, this mistake is my fault. | take full responsibility."
©) B. "lam so sorry an error led to your allergic reaction. | will do my best to help you
through it."

©) C. "There are things you can do to prevent problems like this. | recommend you get an
allergy alert bracelet." AGiVEKe Winelone
