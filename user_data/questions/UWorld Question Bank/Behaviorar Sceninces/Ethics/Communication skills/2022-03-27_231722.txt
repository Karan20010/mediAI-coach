Pain is subjective, and physicians must use clinical judgment to balance effective pain
management with prevention of drug overuse and misuse. Prescription opioid misuse has
become an increasing occurrence in recent years. Signs of misuse include not taking
medication as prescribed, requesting early refills, accessing drugs from multiple physicians or
illicit sources, requesting higher doses, and refusing alternate pain-management strategies.

This patient is showing signs suggestive of opioid use disorder: running out of medication
early; obtaining prescriptions in emergency departments rather than from the primary
prescriber; tolerance (ie, requiring higher doses to attain the same effect); and dependence.
However, confronting the patient about misuse at this point is unlikely to be helpful. The most
appropriate initial action is a patient-centered approach: validating the patient's concern
about pain control; engaging the patient in a nonjudgmental, collaborative discussion of how
he is using the medication; and exploring reasons for the escalating use.

(Choice A) This statement may be interpreted as confrontational and put the patient on the
defensive. It fails to validate the patient's subjective experience of pain and instead focuses
on the physician's concerns about dependence.

(Choices B and E) These statements reject the patient's request for more medication without

discussion and prematurely shut down the conversation. This approach is likely to frustrate
