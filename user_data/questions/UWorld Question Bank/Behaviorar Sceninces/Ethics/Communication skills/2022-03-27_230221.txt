(Choice D) Inquiring about the patient's understanding of federally funded health care
systems is less focused and relevant compared to direct discussion, exploration of views, and
reassurance regarding the influenza vaccination.

(Choice E) Although the patient has the right to ultimately decline vaccination, the physician

Trust is central to the provider-patient therapeutic alliance and is associated with improved
outcomes. Distrust by minority patients may result from numerous factors (eg, historical
legacy, experience of discrimination, low cultural inclusivity). Providers can build trust through
open-ended discussion and focused reassurance using culturally relevant materials.
