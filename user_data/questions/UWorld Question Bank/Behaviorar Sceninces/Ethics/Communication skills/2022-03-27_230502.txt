A 40-year-old unemployed man with chronic back pain comes to the office for an appointment
with a new physician. The patient injured his back in a work accident years ago and has not
worked since. He uses marijuana daily to "ease the pain" and admits that a portion of his
income goes toward its purchase. The patient says that nothing has changed and asks the
physician to sign a disability form so he can continue to collect disability benefits. When the
physician asks about his disability and previous treatment, he replies angrily, "| wouldn't be
here re-applying for disability if anything had worked" and slams the disability form down on
the table. Review of his medical records indicates a normal MRI one year earlier and
inconsistent adherence with physical rehabilitation appointments. The patient walks normally
with no apparent discomfort or limitations. Which of the following is the most appropriate
response by the physician?

(© A. "lam unable to sign the form due to my concern about your drug use."

©) B. "lam unable to sign the form due to my concern about inappropriate use of
disability benefits."
