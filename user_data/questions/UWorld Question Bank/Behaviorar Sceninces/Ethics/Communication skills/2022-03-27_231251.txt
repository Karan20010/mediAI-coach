When patients & families request that "everything" be done

"Every treatment with even the slightest possibility of
benefit" (rare)
Understand what

"Everything that you, as my physician, feel is
“everything” means worthwhile"

"Everything to relieve symptoms, even though it may
shorten life"

Use clear & direct language ("Your mother is dying")
Communicate prognosis |e Maintain consistent messaging

Avoid discussing minutiae of management
