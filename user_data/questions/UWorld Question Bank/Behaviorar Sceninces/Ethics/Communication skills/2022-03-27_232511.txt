treatment. The more critical issue is determining if he is having thoughts of harming himself or
others because this would determine the need to hold him in the emergency department.

(Choices C and D) These statements fail to address directly the patient's potential for
violence. Determining if this patient is feeling homicidal and/or suicidal is the most critical step
in management.

(Choice E) Although this statement attempts to be empathic, it asks a closed-ended yes-or-no
question in a leading manner that may irritate the patient and cause him to become defensive.
It would be better to ask the patient to talk about what he is going through in an open-ended
fashion (eg, "You have been through a lot today. How are you managing it all?").

Educational objective:

In agitated patients, especially those admitted for self-inflicted injuries or recent violence, the
potential for further violence should be addressed directly. Patients should be asked if they
are having any thoughts or impulses to hurt themselves or others.
