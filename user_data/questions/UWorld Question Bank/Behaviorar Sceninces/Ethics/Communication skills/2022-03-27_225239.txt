A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to lower back pain after lifting heavy furniture a
week ago. She recently moved to the area with her boyfriend, who is starting a new job.
Physical examination shows mild paraspinal muscle tenderness. There is no radiation of pain
on either side during the straight-leg raise test, and no neurologic deficits are noted in the
lower extremities. However, multiple bruises in various stages of healing are noted on her
abdomen and back. When the patient is asked about the bruising, she says, "It's nothing. I'm
just really clumsy and bump into things." The patient provides brief responses and avoids eye
contact throughout the evaluation. Which of the following is the most appropriate statement?

©) A. "Given the location of your bruises, I'm concerned they were caused by someone
else."

©) B. "I can help if someone is hurting you, but you need to tell me about the bruises."
©) C. "Moving to a new city can be stressful. How are things going at home?"

©) D."No one deserves to be in a relationship in which they are being harmed."

|) E. "Where could you go if you felt unsafe at home and wanted to leave?"
