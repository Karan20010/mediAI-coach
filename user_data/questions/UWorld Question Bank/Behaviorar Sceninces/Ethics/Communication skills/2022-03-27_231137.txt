(Choices C and D) These responses assume that the patient's condition is not serious or
urgent. They may also convey that the patient's concerns are being given lower priority and
insinuate that the patient made a mistake in coming to an urgent care clinic. A patient who is
already frustrated is likely to experience these comments as dismissive and judgmental.

(Choice E) Although this statement acknowledges the patient's perspective, it does not
attempt to defuse and could possibly increase the patient's anger. Focusing on the reason for
the patient's visit is likely to be more productive.

Educational objective:

Patient-centered communication involves acknowledging the patient's perspective, showing
respect, and being nondefensive and nonjudgmental. Long delays are best handled with a
straightforward apology and a focus on the patient's concerns.
