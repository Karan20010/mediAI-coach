Patients commonly use herbal preparations and dietary supplements. Although the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements, the regulations are less
strict than those for prescription and over-the-counter medications. Some herbal products
have established safety and/or efficacy, but there are few quality assurances regarding the
content and purity of many herbal supplements, and unknown toxic ingredients may cause
adverse effects and dangerous drug interactions. For example, the herbal supplement
ephedra, marketed as a diet pill and energy booster, was banned by the FDA in 2004 due to
the risk of cardiovascular complications (eg, increased blood pressure, myocardial infarction,
stroke). However, ephedra-containing products are still readily available through the Internet.

should not be immediately dismissed. The physician should instead assess the ingredients
for contraindications or drug interactions and then provide counsel regarding the potential
risks, especially given her medical history.
