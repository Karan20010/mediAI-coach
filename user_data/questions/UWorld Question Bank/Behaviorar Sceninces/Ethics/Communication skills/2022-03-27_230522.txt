(Choice B) It is premature to suggest that this patient is attempting to commit fraud without
performing an appropriate history and physical examination.

(Choices C and D) It is inappropriate to sign the form at this point in the interview without
learning more about the patient and his condition. It is incorrect to assume that the previous
disability determination was correct and that nothing has changed.

(Choice E) Unless the patient is abusive or creating an unsafe situation, confronting him
directly about his anger is not appropriate and will be unlikely to improve the situation.

Educational objective:

Physicians are frequently asked to evaluate whether a patient is entitled to disability benefits.
When interacting with demanding patients, it is best to explain that the physician has a
responsibility to perform a thorough assessment prior to making this determination.
