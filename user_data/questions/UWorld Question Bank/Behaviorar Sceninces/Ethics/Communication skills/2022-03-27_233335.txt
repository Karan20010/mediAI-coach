(Choice C) This statement may be interpreted as defensive because it focuses on explaining
that the problem is not the physician's responsibility. Quickly addressing the patient's needs is
more likely to defuse the situation and build the physician-patient relationship.

(Choice D) Deferring resolution of the issue until after the examination is unlikely to defuse

the patient's immediate anger and could, in turn, negatively affect her cooperation with the
examination.

Educational objective:
Initial encounters with angry patients are best managed by acknowledging their distress and
responding to their immediate concerns.
