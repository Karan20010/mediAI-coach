This gravely ill patient has acute respiratory failure due to refractory metastatic lung cancer.
Because the patient is rapidly deteriorating, discussions regarding goals of care are time-
sensitive, as she may soon be incapacitated (eg, urgently intubated) and unable to participate
in her own decision-making (Choice E).

The patient and her family request that "everything" be done, a frequently voiced sentiment
during care discussions. In the outpatient oncology setting, "everything" meant exhausting
multiple chemotherapy regimens to achieve a disease response. Unfortunately, the patient
has become unstable and is very likely to die during her acute hospitalization. Predefined
preferences should therefore be revisited regularly, including whenever there is a major
change in clinical status. The physician cannot presume that a patient's past preferences can
be directly extrapolated to a new situation.

Patients can be unsure of how to express evolving preferences without an open invitation to
a discussion. Therefore, clarifying the patient's current concept of "everything" is the first step
toward developing a shared plan of care. "Everything" has fluid meanings, shifting across both
a patient's life span and different clinical situations. Due to this wide variability, it is critical to
guide and support patients as they weigh the acceptability of potentially harmful interventions
with a low likelihood of benefit.
