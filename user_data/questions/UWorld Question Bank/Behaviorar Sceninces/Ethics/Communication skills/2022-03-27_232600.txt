A 31-year-old woman comes to the emergency department for evaluation of nausea, vomiting,
and abdominal pain over the past 2 days. The triage nurse notes that the patient's legal name
differs from what was written on the intake form. While reviewing the patient's electronic
medical record, you see that the patient's sex is listed as male and that multiple pronouns
have been used to describe the patient in prior notes. In addition to introducing yourself to the
patient, which of the following is the most appropriate initial statement?

©) A. "Lask all my patients about their gender identity; could you please tell me if you
identify as a man or a woman?"

©) B. "Lask all my patients about their preferred name and pronouns; how would you like
to be addressed?"

©) C. "I'd like to make sure that | refer to you appropriately; would you prefer that | use
male or female pronouns?"

©) D. "I've reviewed your chart and wanted to be sure it's accurate; how would you
describe your gender identity?"

(©) E. "To be sure | ask pertinent questions for your symptoms, could you please verify
your sex assigned at birth?"
