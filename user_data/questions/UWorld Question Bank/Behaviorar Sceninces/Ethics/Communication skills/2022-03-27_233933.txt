A 68-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss lipid-lowering therapy. She was
prescribed rosuvastatin 6 months ago following a transient ischemic attack, but her pharmacy
sent a notice to the physician a week ago that she has not filled her prescription for the past 3
months. The patient otherwise feels well and has had no recurrent neurologic symptoms.
When asked why she is not taking her medication, she says, "| feel great without it. The
ministroke was the scariest thing that ever happened to me, and now that | have put it behind
me, | don't want the medication to remind me about my problem all over again." Which of the
following is the most appropriate response to this patient's statement?

© A. "| understand that having a ministroke was scary. Maybe we can talk about how the
medication can help keep you healthy."

©) B. "It is your choice whether to take the medication. But for your safety, please discuss
your preferences with me first."

©) C. "It sounds like you believe another ministroke is unlikely to happen to you. Is that
correct?"

©) D. "Many patients share your concerns about the medication. However, most people
who stop the medication later regret not taking it." AGiVEKE Winelons
