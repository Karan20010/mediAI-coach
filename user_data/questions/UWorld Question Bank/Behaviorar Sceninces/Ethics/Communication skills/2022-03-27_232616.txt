(Choice D) This approach is open-ended and allows the patient to express the patient's
preferred gender identity; however, it is overly frank as an opening question and may alienate
the patient. In addition, it hints at discriminatory documentation throughout the medical record,
which may erode patient trust and harm rapport.

(Choice E) Knowing the patient's assigned sex at birth is important for accurate diagnosis and
treatment; however, this is an uncomfortable initial question and does not clarify the patient's
current gender identity or preferred pronouns.

Educational objective:

Gender-diverse patients require culturally competent medical care, which includes a tactful
inquiry about preferred identifiers (eg, name, pronouns) followed by accurate and consistent
documentation in the electronic medical record.
