The physician is confronted with a patient who is in denial about his terminal illness and
remains unrealistically hopeful about surviving pancreatic cancer. Patient reactions to terminal
illness are variable and mediated by coping style, personality, culture, values, and religious
beliefs. Patients may go through 5 stages in coping with terminal illness (denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, acceptance). However, patients do not necessarily experience all the
stages of grief or in a prescribed sequence.

Hope, even when unrealistic, can be a powerful mechanism to help patients cope with pain,
fear of death, and the ordeal of treatment. If the patient's denial is not interfering with
receiving necessary medical care or discussing his goals regarding end-of-life care, it should
not be confronted. The physician should be supportive of the patient's hopeful perspective,
and at the same time, engage him in discussion regarding important end-of-life care decisions.

(Choices A, B, and D) These responses confront the patient's denial by refuting hope and
challenging his self-concept that he is a "survivor" who can beat cancer. They focus on what
the physician thinks is important, rather than acknowledging where the patient is emotionally.
These statements may be perceived as unsupportive and harsh and have a detrimental effect
on the patient's ability to cope with the stress of a terminal illness. If the patient's denial is not
interfering with his care, it should not be confronted.
