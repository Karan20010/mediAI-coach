This patient is angry and verbally abusive after receiving an unexpected cancer diagnosis.
Anxiety and distress likely exacerbate his sense of entitlement and demanding personality
characteristics, and the physician must face the challenge of responding to his insulting
comments. When patients are upset, they may have difficulty fully processing information.
Instead, they may express anger at the physician rather than acknowledging their own fears.

The best approach is to defuse the situation by being nondefensive and acknowledging the
patient's anger. This should be followed by an open-ended approach that elicits the
patient's understanding about his condition and encourages him to express his concerns
and fears about the diagnosis that likely underlie his behavior.

(Choice A) This statement initially expresses empathy but then assumes a defensive stance,
which is unlikely to engage the patient or defuse his anger.

(Choice C) This statement assumes that the patient did not understand the information
provided, which may be perceived as judgmental. The best initial approach is to acknowledge
the patient's anger while exploring his understanding of the results. Reassurance that the
cancer was removed would be the appropriate next step if discussion revealed that he
misunderstood his prognosis.
