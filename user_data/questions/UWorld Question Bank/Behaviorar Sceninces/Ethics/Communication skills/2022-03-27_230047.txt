Nearly 20% of the United States population speaks languages other than English at home. It
is therefore essential that physicians assess language proficiency when delivering care to
immigrant populations. This patient's immigrant background and difficulty describing her pain
should raise concern about limited English proficiency (LEP) and the need for a qualified
medical interpreter. In the United States, patients with LEP experience a variety of health care
disparities, including reduced clinical encounter time, substandard medical treatment, and
higher rates of adverse events and preventable medical errors. The safety of LEP patients is
particularly jeopardized in high-risk clinical situations such as emergency department care,
surgical care, hospital discharge, and medical reconciliation.

A useful screening technique to assess language proficiency is to ask the patient, "How well
do you speak English: Not at all, not well, well, or very well?" An interpreter is appropriate for
patients who cannot respond or respond "not well." Recommended interventions to prevent
adverse events include providing a qualified medical interpreter in high-risk clinical situations
and providing translated educational materials. Using the "teach back" method (in which
patients are asked to "teach" the physician what was just explained to them) can also serve to
confirm understanding.
