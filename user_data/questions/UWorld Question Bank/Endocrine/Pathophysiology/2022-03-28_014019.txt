The combination of acute-onset polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion, and a fruity odor to the
urine or breath is suggestive of diabetic ketoacidosis, which in this patient was most likely
precipitated by a viral infection. The laboratory findings of hyperglycemia and anion gap
metabolic acidosis confirm the diagnosis. The high anion gap is due to the presence of
unmeasured anionic ketoacids (eg, beta-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate).

Patients with metabolic acidosis usually develop a compensatory respiratory alkalosis by
hyperventilating (eg, Kussmaul respirations), which helps mitigate the acidemia by causing a
drop in the PaCO,. However, if the PaCO, persists above the expected compensatory range
(given by Winter formula, where PaCO, = [1.5 * HCO,] + 8 + 2), it indicates a superimposed

respiratory acidosis that is interfering with normal respiratory compensation.

This patient's serum HCO; of 14 mEq/L should be compensated by a PaCO, in the range of
27-31 mm Hg. However, his PaCO, is higher than expected, indicating that he has a mixed
acid-base disturbance consisting of metabolic and respiratory acidoses. Severe diabetic
ketoacidosis can cause pulmonary edema, respiratory fatigue, and decreased mental status,

which may lead to hypoventilation and subsequent hypercarbic respiratory failure.

(Choice A) Acute adrenal insufficiency is characterized by mineralocorticoid deficiency, which
