This patient most likely has the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
(SIADH), which can be caused by a multitude of drugs, including carbamazepine,
cyclophosphamide, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) and oxytocin are synthesized within magnocellular
neurons found in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus. Most
magnocellular neurons produce either vasopressin or oxytocin. Once translated, these
hormones are packaged into vesicles and travel via anterograde axonal transport to the
posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis). There, the hypothalamic axons terminate into Herring
bodies, which are specialized nerve terminals that act as storage sites for the secretory
vesicles. These vesicles also contain proteins known as neurophysins that are involved in
posttranslational hormone processing and stabilization during axonal transport. Vasopressin
and oxytocin and their associated neurophysins are then secreted from the posterior
pituitary into the hypophysial vein to enter the systemic circulation.

(Choice A) The anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) is the glandular portion of the pituitary
that lies closest to the optic chiasm. It is composed of various hormone-secreting cells,
including somatotropes (growth hormone), lactotropes (prolactin), gonadotropes (FSH and
LH), thyrotropes (TSH), and corticotropes (ACTH).
