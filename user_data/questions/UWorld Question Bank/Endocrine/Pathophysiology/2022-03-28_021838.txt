A 45-year-old previously healthy man comes to the office due to worsening muscle pain and
weakness over the past 6 months. Carrying heavy items such as groceries has become
increasingly difficult, and any prolonged activity causes diffuse muscle cramps. He has also
had a 4.5-kg (10-Ib) weight gain over this time. The patient takes no medications and does not
use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. Blood pressure is 140/90 mm Hg and pulse is 56/min.
BMI is 26 kg/m2. Physical examination shows muscle weakness, predominantly of the
shoulder and hip girdles. When the knee reflex is elicited, the quadriceps muscle contracts
briskly but relaxation takes longer than normal. There are splitting and peeling of the nails.
Serum creatine kinase is elevated. Which of the following tests is most likely to identify the
cause of this patient's muscle weakness?

©) A. 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion

©) B. Acetylcholine receptor antibody titers
