hormone levels are elevated and TSH is suppressed, findings consistent with primary
hyperthyroidism. In light of her recent pregnancy and negative thyrotropin receptor antibody
assay (which makes Graves disease unlikely) this is most likely due to postpartum
thyroiditis.

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles similar to that seen in chronic lymphocytic
(Hashimoto) thyroiditis. Histologic inspection demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration,
sometimes with the formation of germinal centers. The breakdown of follicle margins and loss
of colloid may also be seen.

Postpartum thyroiditis typically begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to the release of
preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to the depletion
of thyroid hormone and an eventual return to a euthyroid state.

(Choice A) Intake of exogenous thyroid hormone can cause thyrotoxicosis with suppression
of TSH. However, thyroid enlargement would not be seen (thyroid atrophy is more typical).

(Choice B) Like postpartum thyroiditis, subacute granulomatous (de Quervain/postviral)
thyroiditis can have a transient hyperthyroid phase due to the release of preformed thyroid
