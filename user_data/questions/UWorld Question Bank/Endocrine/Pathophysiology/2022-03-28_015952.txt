tolerance tests.

(Choice B) Decreased insulin production due to pancreatic islet cell autoantibodies describes
the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Islet cell destruction in CFRD is not an
autoimmune process.

(Choice C) Although glucagon increases in response to starvation, chronic malnutrition is
likely to result in glucagon resistance. In addition, glucagon-producing alpha islet cells are
damaged along with beta cells in patients with CF, resulting in decreased glucagon secretion.

(Choices D and E) Stress-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance can occur in times of
acutely increased metabolic demand (eg, trauma, burn, sepsis) due to the release of cortisol,
epinephrine, and glucagon. Patients with late-stage CFRD may have a component of insulin
resistance during times of acute stress and inflammation (eg, pulmonary exacerbation);
however, this is not the primary mechanism of CFRD.

Educational objective:

Cystic fibrosis (CF) causes the accumulation of thick, viscous secretions in ducts throughout
the body. CF-related diabetes occurs after the progressive destruction of pancreatic islet cells
leads to decreased insulin production.
