*Low aldosterone but excessive, weak mineralocorticoid (11-deoxycorticosterone).
**Low cortisol but excessive, weak glucocorticoid (corticosterone).

This patient is genetically male (46,XY) with features suggestive of 17 alpha-hydroxylase
deficiency, a rare cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The enzyme 17 alpha-
hydroxylase is active in the adrenal glands and gonads and is responsible for converting
pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone and progesterone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone.
Deficiency of this enzyme impairs synthesis of sex hormones (eg, testosterone, estradiol)
and cortisol but does not inhibit mineralocorticoid production.

Due to the absence of androgens in utero, genetic males (46,XY) with 17 alpha-hydroxylase
deficiency have undervirilized, ambiguous genitalia. In severe cases, they appear
phenotypically female but lack internal female genitalia, as in this case. In contrast, genetic
females (46,XX) develop normal internal and external genitalia. At puberty, impaired synthesis
of sex hormones in the gonads leads to absent secondary sexual characteristics in both
sexes and primary amenorrhea in girls.

Excess mineralocorticoid production results in hypertension and hypokalemia that are

usually detected around the expected time of puberty. Low cortisol provides positive
feedback to increase ACTH production, further stimulating the mineralocorticoid pathway. This
