This patient has an enlarging thyroid nodule associated with an elevated calcitonin level, which
is concerning for medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a malignancy arising from the thyroid C
(parafollicular) cells. These findings, in association with mucosal neuromas and marfanoid
habitus (eg, arm span > height, long fingers, joint laxity), suggest multiple endocrine
neoplasia type 2B (MEN2B). MEN2 syndromes are caused by germline mutations of the
RET proto-oncogene. MTC is present in nearly all patients with MEN2 and is usually more
aggressive and occurs at an earlier age than sporadic MTC.

Pheochromocytomas develop in roughly half of patients with MEN2 syndromes and cause
paroxysmal hypertension and tachycardia due to the intermittent secretion of catecholamines.
The abrupt, severe increase in blood pressure can precipitate episodic headaches and is
often accompanied by other symptoms associated with catecholamine excess (eg,
diaphoresis, tremor, chest pain).

(Choice B) Hyperparathyroidism with secondary hypercalcemia is the most common
manifestation of MEN1. Hyperparathyroidism (due to parathyroid chief cell hyperplasia or
adenoma formation) is also seen in 10%-20% of patients with MEN2A, but it is not a feature of
MENZB.
