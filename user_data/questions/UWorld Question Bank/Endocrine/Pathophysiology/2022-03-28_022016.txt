hypothalamic lesions because the dominant effect of the hypothalamus on them is stimulatory.
Although abruptly discontinuing an oral glucocorticoid can cause adrenal insufficiency with a
subsequent increase in ACTH, low blood pressure, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and
hyperkalemia would be expected. In addition, adrenal insufficiency typically occurs rapidly
after glucocorticoid withdrawal (not 6 months later).

(Choice E) Vasopressin is produced in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the
hypothalamus and transported to the posterior pituitary for release. Lesions of the
hypothalamus and pituitary stalk can decrease vasopressin levels. Mass lesions in the central
nervous system can cause vasopressin secretory dysregulation, leading to the syndrome of
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) with euvolemic hyponatremia. However, the
normal sodium levels in this patient exclude this syndrome.

Educational objective:

The release of prolactin is under inhibitory control by dopamine secretion from the
hypothalamus. Disruption of dopaminergic pathways or blockade of dopamine D2 receptors
can cause hyperprolactinemia.
