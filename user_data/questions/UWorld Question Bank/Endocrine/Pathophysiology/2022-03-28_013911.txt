impaired thyroid hormone feedback.

(Choice C) Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) is a transport protein that binds T4. TBG
deficiency results in a euthyroid state characterized by a low level of total T4 but normal TSH
and free T4 levels.

(Choice E) Neonatal Graves disease is characterized by the transplacental transfer of
maternal TSH receptor—stimulating antibodies due to maternal Graves disease. This condition
causes transient hyperthyroidism with elevated T4 and decreased TSH.

Educational objective:
Thyroid dysgenesis (ie, hypoplasia, aplasia, ectopy) is the most common cause of primary
congenital hypothyroidism. In this condition, TSH is elevated and thyroxine (T4) is low.
