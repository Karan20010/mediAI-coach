hypokalemia (mineralocorticoid excess) and do not undergo puberty (no sex steroids).

(Choice D) 21-hydroxylase deficiency decreases glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
synthesis and increases adrenal androgen production. Girls are born with ambiguous genitalia
(androgen excess) and frequently develop hypotension and hyperkalemia (mineralocorticoid
deficiency).

(Choice E) Side-chain cleavage enzyme converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Because this
is the first enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway, deficiency impairs synthesis of all steroid
hormones. Complete deficiency is lethal due to absent placental progesterone synthesis.

Educational objective:

11B-hydroxylase deficiency typically results in excessive adrenal androgen and
mineralocorticoid (11-deoxycorticosterone) production. Genetically female infants are born
with ambiguous genitalia, and affected individuals develop hypertension and hypokalemia
early in life.
