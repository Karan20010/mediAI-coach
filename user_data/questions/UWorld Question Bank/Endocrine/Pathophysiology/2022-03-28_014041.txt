A group of investigators is studying the mechanisms of signal transduction involved in the
pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Their research focuses on the intracellular signaling
cascade that begins when insulin binds to the insulin receptor. In a series of experiments, they
demonstrate that pre-treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) results in decreased
insulin-mediated glucose uptake. This effect of TNF-a is most likely mediated through
upregulation of which of the following processes?

A. Cyclic AMP hydrolyzation (25%)

B. Phosphatidylinositol cleavage (18%)

C. Proline residue hydroxylation (4%)
YD. Serine residue phosphorylation (31%)

E. Stimulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (19%)
