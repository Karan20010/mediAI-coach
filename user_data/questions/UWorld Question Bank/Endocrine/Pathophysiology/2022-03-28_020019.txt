(Choices A, C, D and E) MEN‘ is characterized by anterior pituitary adenomas, primary
hyperparathyroidism (due to parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia), and neuroendocrine
tumors of the pancreas and gastrointestinal tract (eg, gastrinoma, insulinoma). A number of
other tumors are also more frequent in MEN1, including adrenocortical adenomas and
neuroendocrine thymomas (thymic carcinoid). However, MEN1 is due to mutations in the
MEN7 gene (not RET) and is not associated with MTC.

Educational objective:

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is caused by germline activating mutations in the RET
proto-oncogene and frequently results in both medullary thyroid cancer and
pheochromocytoma. In patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma, induction of
anesthesia (eg, preparation for thyroidectomy) can precipitate a catecholamine surge, leading
to hypertensive crisis, flash pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation.

and management of neuroendocrine tumors: pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and
medullary thyroid cancer.
