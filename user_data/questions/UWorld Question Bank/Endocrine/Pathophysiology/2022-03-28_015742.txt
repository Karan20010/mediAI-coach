The term somatostatin was originally applied to the 14-aminoacid cyclic peptide that is
secreted by the hypothalamus and that inhibits the production of growth hormone from the
anterior pituitary gland. Somatostatin is now known to be secreted from other parts of the
central nervous system and from pancreatic delta cells. Somatostatin secreted from
pancreatic "delta cells" decreases the secretion of secretin, cholecystokinin, glucagon, insulin,
and gastrin. Somatostatinomas are rare pancreatic islet cell tumors that arise from delta cells.
Patients with somatostatinomas present with hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia, steatorrhea
(excessive fat in the feces), and gallbladder stones. Gallbladder stones form because of poor
gallbladder contractility, which is secondary to inhibition of cholecystokinin release.

(Choices C and D) Somatostatin decreases the release of glucagon as well as insulin.
However, the secretion of insulin is more profoundly inhibited than is glucagon; therefore, the
net result is hyperglycemia.

(Choice A) Steatorrhea results from the decreased secretion of secretin as well as a
decrease in gastrointestinal motility.

(Choice E) Adecrease in gastrin release causes hypochlorhydria.

(Choice F) As indicated above, somatostatin does decrease growth hormone secretion from ctivate V
