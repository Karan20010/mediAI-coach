can result in hypotension, hyperkalemia, and mild hyperchloremic acidosis. This patient's
laboratory findings are not consistent with acute adrenal insufficiency.

(Choice B) Ketoacidosis results in a low serum pH that causes much of the serum
bicarbonate (HCO.-) to be converted into carbonic acid (H2CO3), reducing the amount of
bicarbonate filtered by the kidney. In addition, acidosis increases renal tubular H- secretion,
which promotes bicarbonate reuptake and further reduces renal bicarbonate loss.

(Choice C) This patient's volume depletion and resulting hypotension reduce renal perfusion
pressure, leading to increased renin release by the renal juxtaglomerular cells.

(Choice D) Acute tubular necrosis is characterized by progressively increasing serum
creatinine with epithelial cell casts and muddy brown granular casts seen on urinalysis. Acute

tubular necrosis is unlikely in this patient with normal serum creatinine.

Educational objective:
Normally, metabolic acidosis is partially compensated for by respiratory alkalosis. When the
steady-state PaCO, persists above the range given by the Winter formula (PaCO, = [1.5 *

HCO,] + 8 + 2), the patient has a superimposed respiratory acidosis (respiratory failure).
