exacerbating hyponatremia. As a result, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency present
with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremia, and nonanion gap metabolic acidosis.
(Choice A) Mineralocorticoid excess (ie, primary hyperaldosteronism) leads to Na- retention,
urinary loss of K- and H-, and metabolic alkalosis (ie, increased plasma HCO.;). However,
significant hypernatremia is avoided due to aldosterone escape.

(Choice C) Thiazide diuretics block Na-/Cl- reabsorption in the distal tubule. This allows more
Na: to reach the collecting tubule, enhancing K- and H- excretion. Findings include
hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

(Choice D) Isolated hyperkalemia is usually due to excess dietary potassium intake or cell
lysis (eg, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis). Hyperkalemia can also be caused by decreased shift of

K- into the cells due to insulin deficiency or occasionally by beta 2 antagonists (eg, metoprolol).

(Choice E) Normal serum sodium in the setting of hypokalemia and hyperchloremic metabolic
acidosis suggests distal hypokalemic or proximal renal tubular acidosis.
