however, hyperthyroidism can also be due to other processes such as toxic adenoma, toxic
multinodular goiter, and thyroiditis. This patient's positive serum assay for thyrotropin
receptor antibodies (TRAb) confirms the diagnosis of Graves disease. TRAb bind and
activate the TSH receptor, causing increased release of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland,
which is responsible for the general symptoms of hyperthyroidism (eg, fatigue, palpitations,

weight loss, and insomnia).

In addition to the thyroid, the TSH receptor antigen is present on fibroblasts, adipocytes, and
other tissues. Thyroid dermopathy is caused by stimulation of fibroblasts by TRAb and
activated T-cells, leading to excess production of glycosaminoglycans and adipogenesis. This
leads to induration and thickening of the skin over the shins (pretibial myxedema, as shown
above). Graves ophthalmopathy occurs in a similar manner, with expansion of the retro-orbital
tissues displacing the globe forward (proptosis). Because these processes are directly related
to TRAb, they have a high specificity for Graves disease.

(Choices A, B, C, and E) Hyperthyroidism also causes a hypermetabolic/hyperadrenergic
state that can present with heat intolerance, tremor, lid lag, tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. In
