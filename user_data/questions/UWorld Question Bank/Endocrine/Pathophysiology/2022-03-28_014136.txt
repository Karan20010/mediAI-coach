cells. Patients with insulin resistance will have increased production of both insulin and C-
peptide, but C-peptide does not cause insulin resistance.

(Choices D and E) The "metabolic syndrome" is a common collection of clinical features that
includes elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, central obesity, hypertension, and
elevated glucose. These patients typically have significant insulin resistance. However,
elevated LDL and HDL levels do not contribute to insulin resistance or acanthosis nigricans.

Educational objective:

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is due to insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. Chronically
elevated free fatty acid levels contribute to insulin resistance by impairing insulin-dependent
glucose uptake and increasing hepatic gluconeogenesis.
