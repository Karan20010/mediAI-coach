are commonly seen in older individuals (age >50-60).

(Choice C) Loss of sensation in the perineal area (saddle anesthesia) can indicate cauda

16 equina syndrome, which is commonly due to epidural cord compression from a malignancy.
Patients usually develop urinary retention late in the course of the disease, usually associated
19 with fecal incontinence.

21 (Choices D and E) Cognitive impairment (mini-mental status examination score <22) is often
seen in normal pressure hydrocephalus, and lower extremity hyperreflexia would suggest

24 spinal cord disease. Both of these conditions can cause loss of central nervous system
inhibition of detrusor contraction, leading to urge incontinence. Urge incontinence is

27 characterized by a sudden desire to urinate. However, absence of other symptoms (eg, gait
disturbance) in this patient makes these conditions less likely.

Educational objective:

32 Diabetic autonomic neuropathy is common in type 1 diabetics and can cause overflow
= incontinence due to inability to sense a full bladder and incomplete emptying. Postvoid
35 residual (PVR) testing with ultrasound or catheterization can confirm inadequate bladder

emptying.
