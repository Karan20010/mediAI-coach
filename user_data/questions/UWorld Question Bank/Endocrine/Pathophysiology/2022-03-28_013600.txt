This infant is dehydrated (ie, sunken fontanelle, dry mucous membranes) with hypotension,
hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia. These findings are consistent with classic congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

Patients with 21-hydroxylase deficiency cannot convert 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) into
11-deoxycortisol, which results in elevated 17-OHP and decreased aldosterone and cortisol
production. Corticosteroid precursors accumulate and are diverted toward excess adrenal
androgen biosynthesis. Low cortisol levels (ie, loss of negative feedback) also trigger
increased ACTH production by the anterior pituitary, which further stimulates the formation of
adrenal androgens (Choice D).

Although affected girls are usually identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia (virilization)
from excess androgens, boys have normal genitalia and typically are identified at age 1-2
weeks with vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia due to lack of sufficient
mineralocorticoids (salt wasting). Cortisol deficiency causes hypoglycemia and further
impairs the ability to maintain blood pressure.

(Choice B) CAH due to 17 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency prevents the conversion of

progesterone to 17-OHP, resulting in low 17-OHP, cortisol, and adrenal androgen production.
