The most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia is 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
Genetically female infants typically have ambiguous genitalia (virilization) at birth, whereas
males have phenotypically normal genitalia, with salt-wasting or precocious puberty appearing
later. Elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone is diagnostic.
