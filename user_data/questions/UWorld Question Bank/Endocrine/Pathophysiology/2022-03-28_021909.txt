Hypothyroid myopathy and elevations in CK can be the first signs of hypothyroidism and can
precede other manifestations by months to years. The diagnosis can be confirmed with an
elevated TSH level.

(Choice A) A 24-hour urine cortisol test is used as an initial test for Cushing syndrome. This
disorder can present with proximal muscle weakness and atrophy due to the direct catabolic
effects of cortisol on skeletal muscle. However, there is no associated muscle pain or rise in
CK, reflexes are normal, and other cushingoid features (eg, stria, dorsocervical fatty
hypertrophy) are usually present.

(Choices B and C) Myasthenia gravis is caused by autoantibodies against nicotinic
acetylcholine receptors on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. It
presents with fluctuating weakness that worsens through the day. Lambert-Eaton syndrome is
a paraneoplastic disorder associated with small cell carcinoma of the lung (which can be
identified on CT scan). It is caused by autoantibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels
on the presynaptic membrane, which cause decreased release of acetylcholine. These
disorders affect the neuromuscular junction rather than the muscle itself, and CK is normal.

(Choice D) Muscle biopsy is often needed for diagnosis of inflammatory myositis (eg,
polymyositis, dermatomyositis). However, this patient has symptoms suggestive of
