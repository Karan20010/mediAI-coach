This patient's bitemporal hemianopsia and headaches suggest mass effect symptoms due to
an expanding lesion near the optic chiasm. Cranial imaging (typically MRI scan) can confirm
the diagnosis of a pituitary adenoma. Unlike other pituitary hormones, prolactin secretion is
under negative regulation by dopamine from the hypothalamus, and any disruption of
dopaminergic pathways in the pituitary stalk can cause a moderate increase in prolactin
release. However, very high prolactin levels, as seen in this patient, suggest a prolactin-
secreting adenoma (prolactinoma).

Increased circulating levels of prolactin suppress GnRH secretion, leading to a reduction in
release of LH from the pituitary and decreased testicular testosterone production. In
premenopausal women, prolactinomas typically present early with galactorrhea and
amenorrhea. However, in men and postmenopausal women, early symptoms may be subtle
and nonspecific (eg, decreased libido), and patients frequently present later with mass effect
symptoms (eg, headache, visual field defects).

(Choices B and D) Physiologic GnRH secretion occurs in a pulsatile fashion and initiates
gonadotropin (eg, LH, FSH) and subsequently testosterone secretion. However, prolonged,
continuous GnRH secretion suppresses gonadotropins, resulting in lower levels of sex
steroids. Long-acting GnRH agonists (eg, leuprolide) are used to suppress sex steroid—
