5 alkalosis (due to increased bicarbonate reabsorption).

. (Choice D) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) block aldosterone

: receptors and impair urinary excretion of K- and H~. Side effects include hyperkalemia and

18 metabolic acidosis. Na- excretion is only mildly increased and serum Na: concentration is

usually not significantly affected.

Educational objective:
23 Primary hyperaldosteronism causes increased Na: reabsorption in the renal collecting tubules,

leading to increased urinary excretion of K- and H-. Patients typically have secondary

28 hypertension as well as hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. The serum Na+ concentration
27

= remains normal due to aldosterone escape.
