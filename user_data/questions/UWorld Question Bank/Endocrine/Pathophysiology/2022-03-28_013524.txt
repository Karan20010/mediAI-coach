Pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla
characterized by excess production of catecholamines (norepinephrine, epinephrine,
dopamine). Fluctuating catecholamine release results in increased vascular tone and
hypertension, often associated with episodic headache, diaphoresis, and palpitations. The
diagnosis is confirmed by detecting elevated levels of urinary and plasma catecholamines and
metanephrines (catecholamine breakdown products).

Histopathology shows a highly vascular tumor with nests of spindle-shaped or polygonal cells.
The neurohormonal character of the cells is confirmed with stains for synaptophysin,
chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase, and electron microscopy may show dense
membrane-bound granules containing catecholamines.

(Choices A and C) Syndromes associated with steroid hormone-producing tumors of the
adrenal cortex include hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome), hyperaldosteronism
(hypertension, hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis), and hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne,
androgenetic hair loss). Metabolically active ovarian tumors also can cause
hyperandrogenism. Overproduction of steroid hormones is apparent on electron microscopy
as well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum rather than membrane-bound secretory
granules.
