hypogonadism and may warrant karyotyping to evaluate for Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY)

(Choice B) Mammography may be indicated for findings concerning for breast cancer, such
as a fixed, nontender mass outside of the nipple-areolar complex with associated skin
dimpling, nipple discharge, or adenopathy. Breast cancer is exceedingly rare in adolescent
boys, and this patient has no red-flag findings.

Physiologic gynecomastia is a benign condition caused by a transient proestrogenic hormonal
imbalance during midpuberty; it presents in adolescent boys with unilateral or bilateral tender
breast enlargement. Patients should be reassured that the condition typically self-resolves

within a year.
