However, hypotension in adrenal crisis is often refractory to vasopressors because

glucocorticoids have a permissive effect on vasoconstriction.

(Choice E) Clinical features of hypothyroid crisis may include hypoglycemia and hypotension,
as seen in this patient, but would usually also include altered sensorium, hypothermia,
bradycardia, and hypoventilation. In addition, due to the long plasma half life of levothyroxine,
missing 2 days of therapy would be unlikely to cause a symptomatic drop in thyroid hormone
levels.

Educational objective:

Patients with adrenal insufficiency are not able to increase glucocorticoid production in
response to acute stress (eg, illness, surgery). Adrenal crisis is characterized by severe
hypotension, abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, and fever. In addition to aggressive fluid
resuscitation, treatment requires immediate glucocorticoid supplementation.
