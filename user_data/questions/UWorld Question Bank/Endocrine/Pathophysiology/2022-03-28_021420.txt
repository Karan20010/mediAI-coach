Educational objective:

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles. It typically has a hyperthyroid phase due to
release of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a hypothyroid phase due to depletion of
thyroid hormone stores and eventual return to a euthyroid state. Thyroid metabolic activity
during the hyperthyroid phase is suppressed, and glandular blood flow and radioiodine uptake

are low.
