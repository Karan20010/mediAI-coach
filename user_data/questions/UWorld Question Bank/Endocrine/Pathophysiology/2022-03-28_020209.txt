dyspareunia. Because estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women, prolonged
estrogen deficiency can lead to osteoporosis and an increased risk for fragility fractures (ie,
fractures due to minimal trauma, such as a fall from standing height).

Men with prolactinomas may develop symptoms due to hypogonadism (eg, infertility,
decreased libido), but galactorrhea is rare in both men and postmenopausal women as milk
production requires estrogen/progesterone priming of the breast tissue. Men with
prolactinomas are more likely to present at an advanced stage with mass-effect symptoms
(eg, headache, visual field defects) due to compression of surrounding structures.

(Choices A and D) Central hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting (thyrotroph) pituitary
adenoma can present with weight loss, palpitations, systolic hypertension, and
hyperadrenergic symptoms (eg, hand tremor). Chronic TSH stimulation can also lead to
enlargement of the thyroid gland and compressive symptoms (eg, dysphagia). However,
compression of thyrotroph cells by an enlarging prolactinoma causes central hypothyroidism.

(Choices B and C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by primary
hyperparathyroidism (with hypercalcemia), pituitary tumors (including prolactinoma), and
endocrine pancreatic tumors. Complications of hyperparathyroidism include osteoporosis and
