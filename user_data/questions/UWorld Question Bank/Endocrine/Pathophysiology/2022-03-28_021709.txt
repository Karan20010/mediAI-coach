low free T4) and goiter; although Hashimoto's can occasionally present with an initial
hyperthyroid phase, these patients will have elevated thyroglobulin levels due to inflammatory
disruption of thyroid follicles.

(Choice C) Subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis is characterized by disruption of
follicles and a mixed cellular infiltrate with occasional multinucleated giant cells. Patients may
have hyperthyroidism but typically have a painful, tender thyroid gland and high levels of
thyroglobulin due to destructive thyroiditis.

(Choice D) Medullary thyroid cancer is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from calcitonin-
secreting parafollicular C cells. Microscopy shows nests or sheets of polygonal or spindle-
shaped cells with extracellular amyloid deposits (derived from calcitonin). Clinical features
include diarrhea, flushing, and thyroid nodules, but TSH and free T4 are normal.

(Choice E) Graves disease presents with a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland associated with
hyperthyroidism, exophthalmos, and pretibial myxedema. The thyroid follicular epithelium is
tall and crowded with hyperactive reabsorption, causing scalloping around the edges of the
colloid. However, high serum levels of thyroglobulin would be seen due to increased thyroid
metabolic activity.
