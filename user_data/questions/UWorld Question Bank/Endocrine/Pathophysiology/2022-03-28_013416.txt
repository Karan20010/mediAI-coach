During pregnancy, human placental lactogen is secreted from the placenta in increasing
quantities in the second and third trimesters, resulting in maternal insulin resistance. This
physiologic process in pregnancy helps to supply the developing fetus with a reliable source of
glucose. However, it becomes pathologic when maternal pancreatic function is not sufficient to
overcome the pregnancy-related increase in insulin resistance, resulting in gestational
diabetes mellitus.

Elevated maternal blood glucose leads to excessive transplacental transfer of glucose to the
fetus, causing chronic stimulation of the fetal pancreas. This results in beta cell hyperplasia
and hyperinsulinism. High levels of both fetal insulin (an anabolic hormone) and glucose
promote development of fetal macrosomia with increased central adipose deposition.

After delivery, the infant experiences a sudden interruption in transplacental glucose transfer,
but the hyperinsulinism remains due to beta cell hyperplasia. This can result in rapid
development of profound transient hypoglycemia. In most cases, supportive care only is
needed as the beta cell hyperplasia will resolve over time.

(Choice A) Insulin promotes blood glucose storage in the liver as glycogen; therefore, infants
of mothers with poorly controlled diabetes have increased glycogen stores. However, after

birth these infants have poor mobilization of glycogen stores (glycogenolysis) despite
