A 34-year-old man comes to the clinic due to frequent clumsiness. For the last 6 months, he
has had repeated minor injuries from walking into doorways and stationary objects. The
patient was also reprimanded at work for causing his supervisor to spill coffee when he
bumped into her in the hallway. Medical history is notable for recurrent renal stones; following
a subsequent diagnostic evaluation, the patient underwent definitive treatment with neck
surgery 3 years ago. Family history is unavailable as the patient was adopted. Physical
examination reveals bitemporal visual field defects. Cranial nerves, motor strength, and deep-
tendon reflexes are otherwise normal. In addition to brain imaging, this patient should also be
screened for which of the following tumors?
