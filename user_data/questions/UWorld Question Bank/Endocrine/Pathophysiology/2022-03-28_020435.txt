“Question Id: 19947

This patient has hyperparathyroidism, presenting with osteoporosis and nephrolithiasis
14 associated with mild hypercalcemia and an inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone
* (PTH) level.

PTH increases bone turnover by stimulating the differentiation and activity of osteoblasts,

19 leading to increased bone formation. In addition, PTH upregulates the expression of receptor
activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK-L) on the surface of the activated

: 22 osteoblasts, which binds RANK on nearby osteoclast precursor cells and induces maturation
to active osteoclasts. Therefore, PTH causes bone formation (by direct effect on osteoblasts)
25 and bone resorption (by paracrine effect on osteoclasts). Bone turnover is normally
balanced, with bone formation proportionate to resorption.

In hyperparathyroid states, continuous exposure to high PTH levels cause increased RANK-
+ 30 L expression along with suppression of osteoprotegerin (a counterregulatory decoy receptor).
This leads to greater bone resorption than formation and net bone loss.

38 (Choices A and D) PTH upregulates 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys, which leads to
34
35 increased (not decreased) conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol) to 1,25-

7 36 dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). Calcitriol subsequently induces increased (not decreased)

. 38 intestinal calcium absorption.
