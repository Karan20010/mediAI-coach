This patient has hypertension and likely type 2 diabetes mellitus. The primary defects in the
pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes include defective insulin secretion from pancreatic beta
cells and insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. Insulin resistance is caused by a number of
genetic (eg, insulin receptor and postreceptor mutations) and environmental factors (eg, lack
of physical activity, obesity).

An adipose body habitus is commonly associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.
In particular, excess visceral fat (surrounding internal organs) correlates much more strongly
with insulin resistance than does subcutaneous fat. Measurement of waist circumference or
waist-to-hip ratio is an effective indirect assessment of visceral fat, especially in patients who
are overweight (BMI 25-29.9 kg/mz) or mildly obese (BMI 30-34.9 kg/mz). A waist
circumference >102 cm (40 in) in men and >88 cm (35 in) in women is associated with a
higher risk of insulin resistance.

The association of insulin resistance, increased visceral adiposity (ie, increased waist
circumference), hypertension, and serum lipid abnormalities (high triglyceride levels, low HDL
levels) is known as metabolic syndrome (sometimes called syndrome X). Patients with
metabolic syndrome have increased rates of cardiovascular events and warrant careful risk
