(Choices A and B) In sites other than the epiphyseal growth plate, the effect of estrogen on
bone is anabolic because estrogen increases osteoblastic bone deposition and decreases
osteoclastic bone resorption. Low estrogenic states, such as menopause, are associated with

rapid bone loss.

(Choices D and E) The secretion of somatomedin C, more commonly known as insulin-like
growth factor-1 (IGF-1), is directly increased when growth hormone is secreted from the
pituitary gland. IGF-1 causes the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes in the
epiphyseal growth plate, causing an increase in linear growth. However, unlike estrogen, IGF-
1 does not accelerate epiphyseal closure.

Educational Objective:

Sex hormones promote both growth and epiphyseal plate closure; hence, precocious puberty
may result in a shorter stature, despite an initial growth spurt. Gigantism is caused by
excessive pituitary production of growth hormone; these patients achieve enormous heights:
because, unlike excessive sex steroids, excessive IGF-1 does not lead to premature closure of
the epiphysis.
