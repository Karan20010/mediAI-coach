This patient's laboratory findings are consistent with 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the most
common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is
responsible for conversion of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 17-
hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol. Enzyme deficiency causes the buildup
of 17-OHP, which is then shunted toward androgen production.

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase can result in varying clinical phenotypes depending on the
amount of residual enzyme available. This patient's presentation in adolescence with
menstrual irregularities and signs of androgen excess (ie, hirsutism, nodulocystic acne) is
consistent with the mildest form, nonclassic (late-onset) CAH. Other common findings of
nonclassic CAH include premature pubarche (ie, early appearance of pubic/axillary hair) and
accelerated growth and bone age in school-aged children. Because 21-hydroxylase is not
completely absent in nonclassic CAH, sufficient mineralocorticoids are produced to avoid the
salt wasting (ie, hypotension, hyperkalemia) seen in neonates with severe classic CAH.

Laboratory studies in all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency reveal elevated 17-OHP and
testosterone levels.

(Choices A and B) Patients with 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency have impaired conversion of
11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. In addition to
