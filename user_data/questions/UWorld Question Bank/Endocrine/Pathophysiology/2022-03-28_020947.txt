Excessive male-pattern hair growth in a woman is called hirsutism. Hirsutism can be due to
increased androgen production (eg, polycystic ovary syndrome, Cushing syndrome, ovarian
and adrenal tumors), increased local conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT),
or higher sensitivity of hair follicles to DHT (eg, idiopathic hirsutism). With excessive androgen
exposure, soft, non-pigmented villous hair changes to coarse pigmented terminal hair in
androgen-dependent areas of the body (eg, face, chest, back). Virilization occurs with very
high androgen levels and is characterized by clitoromegaly, increased muscularity, and voice

deepening in addition to hirsutism.

The most common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is often
associated with elevated androgen levels. Combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are
usually the first choice for treating hirsutism in PCOS. OCPs work by suppressing LH
secretion from the pituitary, thereby decreasing ovarian androgen production. They also
increase sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis by the liver, decreasing free testosterone
levels.

(Choice A) Ornithine decarboxylase is involved in DNA stabilization and repair. Inhibition
leads to decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis. Eflornithine is a topical ornithine
decarboxylase inhibitor used to decrease the rate of facial hair growth.
