overt volume overload and significant hypernatremia.

(Choice A) Due to aldosterone escape, serum Na: concentration is normal in
hyperaldosteronism. Increased loss of K- and H- in the urine causes hypokalemia and high

(not low) serum bicarbonate.

(Choice B) Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency have increased renal Na: loss and
reduced urinary excretion of K- and H- due to low aldosterone activity. As a result,
hypovolemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis develop. Hypovolemia also
acts as a nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, further accentuating
the hyponatremia.

(Choice C) Loop or thiazide diuretic use can cause hypovolemia, hyponatremia (mostly with
thiazides), hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis due to urinary losses of Na-, K-, and H-.
Hypovolemia can also exacerbate hyponatremia (due to increased ADH secretion) and
alkalosis (due to increased bicarbonate reabsorption).

(Choice D) Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) block aldosterone
receptors and impair urinary excretion of K- and H~. Side effects include hyperkalemia and

metabolic acidosis. Na excretion is only mildly increased and serum Na: concentration is Activate Windows
