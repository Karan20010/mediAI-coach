unintentional weight loss over the past several months. The patient has no other medical
problems and takes no medications. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs and
has no significant family history. The patient is found to have a neoplastic mass producing
excessive amounts of hormones that are causing her symptoms. Surgical resection of the
abnormal tissue is performed with no operative complications. Microscopic examination of the
tumor cells shows electron-dense, membrane-bound secretory granules.

enolase. The abnormal tissue most likely originated from which of the following?
