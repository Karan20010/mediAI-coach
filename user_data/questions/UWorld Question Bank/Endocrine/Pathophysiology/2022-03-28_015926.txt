Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation (eg, AF508) in
the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. CFTR
normally regulates the transport of chloride ions across secretory epithelial cells; a defect in
this protein leads to the accumulation of thick, inspissated secretions in ducts throughout
the body (eg, lungs, pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, vas deferens).

In the pancreas, dehydrated, viscous secretions block the lumen of the pancreatic ducts,
causing both exocrine (ie, malabsorption) and endocrine dysfunction. Endocrine
dysfunction is due to pancreatic fibrosis and fat infiltration, which cause progressive
encroachment, disruption, and destruction of pancreatic islet cells. This injury results in
decreased insulin production and CF-related diabetes (CFRD). In the initial stages,
glucose is typically normal when fasting (ie, able to produce some insulin) but elevated after a
glycemic load, as seen in this patient. As the disease progresses, there is fasting
hyperglycemia and increasing hemoglobin A1c levels.

Because early diagnosis and treatment with insulin are associated with improved pulmonary
status and overall survival, all CF patients should undergo regular screening with oral glucose
tolerance tests.
