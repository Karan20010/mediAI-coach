beta cells, but it does not participate in IR downstream signaling.

(Choice B) Some hormones (eg, angiotensin II, gonadotropin-releasing hormone) act on
transmembrane receptors coupled with a G,-protein that activates phospholipase C, which
then cleaves phosphatidylinositol biphosphate into two important secondary messengers:
inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). Inositol triphosphate mediates its action by
increasing intracellular calcium influx, and DAG activates protein kinase C.

(Choice C) Hydroxyproline, a major component of bone and skin collagen, is formed by the
hydroxylation of proline, which requires vitamin C. Insulin plays no role in the hydroxylation of
proline.

(Choice E) Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-y) alters gene
transcription by binding to the promoter region of target genes. Activation of PPAR-y results in
improved insulin sensitivity.

Educational objective:

Phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues of insulin receptor and insulin receptor
substrate by serine kinase leads to insulin resistance. This type of phosphorylation can be
induced by TNF-a, catecholamines, glucocorticoids, and glucagon.
