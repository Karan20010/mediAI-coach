Appropriate compensatory PaCO, or HCO; changes in acid-base

disorders

Metabolic acidosis
(acute or chronic)

Expected PaCO2 = (1.5 x HCO3°) + 8 + 2 (Winters
formula)**

Metabolic alkalosis
(acute or chronic)

~7 mm Hg f in PaCOz per 10 mEq/L t in HCO37

Respiratory acidosis
(chronic only*)

~4 mEq/L t in HCO3 per 10 mm Hg f¢ in PaCOg

Respiratory alkalosis
(chronic only*)

~4 mEq/L | in HCO3 per 10 mmHg | in PaCOg

*Compensation for respiratory disturbances is minimal in the acute setting. The full level of

chronic compensation is achieved after ~72 hr. For simplicity, normal baseline PaCOz and HCO3”

should be considered 40 mm Hg and 24 mEq/L, respectively.
**Shortcut: expected PaCO> = last 2 digits of pH.
