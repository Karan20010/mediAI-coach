Glucose levels fall in all newborns after birth, but usually remain 240 mg/dL due to mobilization
of hepatic glycogen stores and initiation of feeding; glucose <40 mg/dL is indicative of
neonatal hypoglycemia, a common metabolic derangement seen in infants of diabetic
mothers.

During gestation, glucose is transferred continuously from mother to fetus via the placenta.
Mothers with diabetes, particularly those with poor glycemic control, often have hyperglycemia,
causing fetal hyperglycemia. In utero, this results in compensatory hyperfunctioning of
pancreatic beta cells, which then produce increased amounts of insulin to handle the
excessive glucose load. Once the maternal glucose supply is interrupted at delivery,
persistent hyperinsulinemia causes increased glucose consumption and transient neonatal
hypoglycemia.

Most neonates with hypoglycemia are asymptomatic but may develop autonomic symptoms
(eg, jitteriness, irritability) and, if severe, hypotonia and seizures. Macrosomia (>4 kg [8 Ib 14
0z] birth weight) is also common in infants of diabetic mothers due to increased exposure to
growth factors (eg, insulin, insulin-like growth factors, growth hormone) that stimulate fetal
growth and increased deposition of glycogen and fat in developing tissues (Choice A).
