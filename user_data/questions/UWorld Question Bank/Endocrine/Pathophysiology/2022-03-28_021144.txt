(Choice D) Secondary (central) hyperthyroidism is a rare disorder, usually caused by a TSH-
secreting pituitary adenoma. Both TSH and serum T4 levels are elevated.

(Choice F) Subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis causes a painful goiter and
transient hyperthyroid symptoms; it typically follows a viral syndrome.

Educational objective:

Central hypothyroidism is characterized by low serum TSH and thyroxine (T4) levels and is
due to hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction. Sheehan syndrome is ischemic necrosis of the
pituitary gland and is typically caused by systemic hypotension during delivery. In addition to
central hypothyroidism, patients may also develop deficiencies of other pituitary hormones (eg,
ACTH, prolactin, gonadotropins).
