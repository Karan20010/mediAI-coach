This patient has infertility, gynecomastia, and long lower extremities, findings which
together are highly suggestive of Klinefelter syndrome. Klinefelter syndrome is a
chromosomal disorder (47,XXY) that can lead to azoospermia and infertility, although
individuals with mosaic variants may have variable degrees of spermatogenesis. Common

nonreproductive manifestations include intellectual and language impairment.

Klinefelter syndrome is the most common cause of male hypogonadism and is characterized
by progressive destruction and hyalinization of the seminiferous tubules, leading to small, firm
testes. Serum inhibin levels are decreased as a result of the Sertoli cell damage; Leydig
cells are usually dysfunctional as well, resulting in reduced testosterone levels. The loss of
feedback inhibition leads to increased FSH and LH secretion. Gynecomastia is caused by
an increased ratio of estrogens to androgens (high gonadotropin levels increase aromatase
activity, which increases conversion of testosterone to estradiol).

(Choice A) Hypogonadotropic (central) hypogonadism is caused by injury or dysfunction of
the hypothalamus (eg, Kallmann syndrome) or pituitary gland (eg, adenomas). LH, FSH, and
testosterone levels are all low, and spermatogenesis is impaired. Unlike in this patient, testes
in central hypogonadism are atrophic and soft (not hyalinized and firm), and gynecomastia is
