synthesis within the zona fasciculata and increased androgen production within the zona
reticularis (can lead to irregular menstruation, hirsutism). ACTH also has a trophic (growth)
effect on the zona fasciculata and reticularis; as time passes, high levels of ACTH
upregulate RNA and protein synthesis and induce cellular proliferation (hyperplasia).

(Choice A) Although increased ACTH can have a transient effect on aldosterone production,
angiotensin II is the primary trophic hormone for the zona glomerulosa. Adenoma or nodular
hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa can be associated with increased secretion of
mineralocorticoids (primary hyperaldosteronism [Conn syndrome]), which presents with
hypertension and hypokalemia (muscle weakness).

(Choice B) Atrophy of the entire adrenal cortex is most commonly caused by autoimmune
adrenalitis and presents with chronic adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). There is a
compensatory rise in ACTH secretion, but, unlike in this patient, urine cortisol excretion is not
elevated.

(Choices C and E) Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting tumor derived from the
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a rare disorder that
may be a precursor to pheochromocytoma. These disorders typically present with symptoms
of catecholamine excess (eg, palpitations, diaphoresis) and episodic hypertension. Patients
