This patient has primary hypothyroidism, a congenital condition most commonly caused by
thyroid dysgenesis. Thyroid dysgenesis refers to an underdeveloped thyroid (ie,
hypoplasia, aplasia) or an ectopic thyroid, which can lie anywhere along the normal path of
embryologic descent from the base of the tongue to its normal location anterior to the thyroid
cartilage. Most cases are sporadic and isolated without other congenital abnormalities.

Newborns are usually asymptomatic due to the transplacental transfer of maternal thyroxine
(T4), although levels are decreased compared to those of healthy patients. Because of
insufficient feedback inhibition from low T4 levels, TSH is elevated. Newborn screening
allows for early identification and treatment with levothyroxine, which prevents the
development of neurocognitive dysfunction.

(Choice A) Hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction can lead to central hypothyroidism due to
deficient TSH production. TSH and T4 levels would both be low.

(Choice B) Congenital hypothyroidism can also be caused by thyroid hormone resistance (eg,
thyroid hormone receptor mutations). However, TSH and T4 levels would be elevated due to

impaired thyroid hormone feedback.

(Choice C) Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) is a transport protein that binds T4. TBG
