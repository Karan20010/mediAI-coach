This patient has medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a neuroendocrine malignancy arising from
the calcitonin-secreting parafollicular C cells. Most cases of MTC are sporadic, but
approximately 20% are familial, due to germline mutations of the RET proto-oncogene.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MENZ2) is the most common inherited disorder associated
with activating RET mutations, and is characterized by:

¢ MTC

¢ Pheochromocytoma

¢ Parathyroid hyperplasia (type 2A) or marfanoid habitus (tall, slender build, increased limb
to height ratio) and mucosal neuromas (type 2B)

Pheochromocytoma is a catecholamine-secreting neoplasm arising from the chromaffin cells
of the adrenal medulla. Up to 50% of patients with MEN2 develop pheochromocytoma. In
patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma, induction of anesthesia can precipitate a
catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine) surge, leading to hypertensive crisis, flash
pulmonary edema, and atrial fibrillation. Therefore, patients who have MTC associated with
germline RET mutations should be screened for pheochromocytoma (eg, 24-hour assay for
urinary metanephrines and catecholamines) prior to surgery.
