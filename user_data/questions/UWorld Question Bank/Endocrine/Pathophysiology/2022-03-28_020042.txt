Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is ealSea by mutations in the MEN7 tumor
suppressor gene and is characterized by tumors of the parathyroid gland, pituitary, and
pancreas (the "3 Ps"). Primary hyperparathyroidism is often the initial manifestation and
usually presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia or renal stones. Prolactin-secreting
adenomas (prolactinomas) are the most common pituitary tumors. In premenopausal women,
prolactinomas typically present with metabolic symptoms (eg, menstrual irregularities,
galactorrhea); in men and postmenopausal women they usually present later when tumor
enlargement leads to mass effect symptoms such as headache or bitemporal visual field
defects (causing clumsiness in this patient) due to compression of the optic chiasm.

Entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are the third major tumor type in MEN1.
Gastrinoma (leading to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) is the most common, followed by
insulinoma and nonfunctional tumors. These tumors are often metastatic and are a frequent

cause of tumor-related death in MEN1. This patient has visual field defects consistent with a
pituitary mass lesion, which warrants cerebral imaging. In addition, he has a history of
symptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Given these features of MEN1, he is also at increased risk
for entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.
