A 45-year-old woman calls 911 due to severe chest pain and dyspnea. The emergency
medical team finds the patient unresponsive with no pulse, and she does not revive despite
extensive cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts. She had a prolonged history of systemic
lupus erythematosus treated with multiple medications and was recently evaluated for
progressive muscle weakness. Records from the patient's most recent office visit show an
elevated blood pressure and examination findings of facial plethora, truncal obesity, and skin
ecchymoses. She was also found to have mild hyperglycemia. Medical history included a left
hip replacement for osteonecrosis of the femoral head 1 year ago. At autopsy, she is found to
have an occluding thrombus in the left main coronary artery, which likely led to sudden cardiac
death. Examination of this patient's adrenal glands is most likely to reveal which of the
following findings?

©) A. Adrenocortical adenoma
©) B. Bilateral cortical atrophy
©) C. Diffuse cortical hyperplasia
.) D. Diffuse cortical hypertrophy
