Educational objective:

Gigantism is caused by excess growth hormone (GH) during childhood and is characterized by
accelerated linear growth, prognathism, and bony enlargement of the hands and feet. GH
excess after closure of the epiphysial growth plates causes acromegaly. GH has direct effects
on target tissues and indirect effects mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 secretion from the

liver.
