Glucagon increases serum glucose by increasing hepatic glucose production via
glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) and gluconeogenesis (production of glucose from
noncarbohydrate sources). Glucagon-induced glycogenolysis is the predominant initial means
of rapidly increasing blood glucose levels during hypoglycemia.

Glucagon functions by stimulating G protein-coupled receptors on hepatocytes, increasing
intracellular CAMP concentration and activating protein kinase A. This leads to activation of
the key glycogenolytic enzyme, glycogen phosphorylase. It also stimulates gluconeogenesis
by activating rate-limiting gluconeogenetic enzymes (eg, pyruvate carboxylase,
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) and decreasing intracellular fructose-2,6-bisphosphate
levels (inhibiting glycolysis).

(Choices A, B, and F) Epinephrine from the adrenals increases glucose by multiple
mechanisms, including increased glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and
decreased glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Epinephrine also causes increased alanine
release from skeletal muscle, which serves as a source of gluconeogenesis in the liver. In
adipose tissue, epinephrine increases the breakdown of triglycerides, thereby increasing
circulating free fatty acids and glycerol that can be utilized as gluconeogenetic substrates.
