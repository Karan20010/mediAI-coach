with levothyroxine, causes increased beta-adrenergic receptor expression. The resulting
hyperadrenergic state can lead to significant cardiovascular complications.

Thyrotoxicosis is associated with hypertension, tachycardia, and increased myocyte
automaticity. Atrial fibrillation is the most common supraventricular arrhythmia and is a
frequent complication of thyrotoxicosis. Thyrotoxicosis also increases contractility, which
increases myocardial oxygen demand and can precipitate angina in patients with underlying
coronary disease. It can also increase cardiac output (while also decreasing systemic
vascular resistance) and lead to high-output heart failure. Therefore, even though this
patient feels well, her dose of levothyroxine should be reduced to avoid long-term

complications of over-replacement.

(Choices A and E) Agranulocytosis is a potential complication of thionamide antithyroid drugs
(eg, propylthiouracil, methimazole). Propylthiouracil can also cause hepatotoxicity. However,
levothyroxine used in thyroid replacement therapy does not cause these complications.

(Choice C) Thyroid over-replacement can cause insomnia and affective symptoms (eg,
anxiety, irritability). Although hyperthyroidism in elderly patients may manifest as social
withdrawal and slowed responses (apathetic depression) resembling dementia, cognitive
dysfunction in younger patients is more likely to be seen in hypothyroidism rather than in
