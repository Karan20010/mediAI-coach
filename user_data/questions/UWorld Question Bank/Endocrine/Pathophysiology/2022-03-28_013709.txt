aromatase.

¢ Higher insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels: Boys with physiologic gynecomastia
have higher serum IGF-1, which stimulates glandular breast tissue, than those without,
resulting in a further imbalance of prostimulatory hormones.

Diagnosis is clinical, but all adolescents should also be screened for substance use (eg,
marijuana, alcohol, anabolic steroids), as was done in this patient, because it may contribute to
gynecomastia. Management of physiologic gynecomastia includes observation and
reassurance that it typically self-resolves within a year; frequent follow-up may be required
for patients with psychosocial stress (eg, low self-esteem).

(Choices A, C, and D) Pathologic gynecomastia should be suspected in patients who
develop breast tissue outside of midpuberty or who have rapidly enlarging tissue or tissue >4
cm. Evaluation may include a serum hormone panel (eg, hCG, LH, estradiol, testosterone) to
evaluate for pathologic hormone imbalance. For example, low testosterone levels suggest
hypogonadism and may warrant karyotyping to evaluate for Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY)
and/or serum prolactin to assess for a prolactin-secreting tumor. This patient's stage 4 pubic
hair and otherwise normal examination make physiologic gynecomastia much more likely.
