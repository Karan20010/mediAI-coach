Question Id: 925
Amenorrhea can be categorized as primary (failure of menarche prior to age 15) or secondary
(cessation of menstruation in premenopausal women who previously have had menses).
Secondary amenorrhea can be due to hypothalamic, pituitary, ovarian, uterine, or other

endocrine (eg, thyroid) disorders.

This patient has secondary amenorrhea associated with low body weight, frequent strenuous
exercise, and lanugo (fine hair indicating inadequate caloric intake), suggesting functional
hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA). FHAis commonly seen in competitive athletes, dancers,
fashion models, and others who maintain very low body weights. The underlying
pathophysiology of FHA is incompletely understood but appears to involve reduced circulating
leptin levels as a result of diminished adipose tissue stores. The decrease in leptin levels
inhibits pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release from the hypothalamus,
causing decreased pituitary LH and FSH secretion, low circulating estrogen levels, and
amenorrhea.

(Choice A) Like FHA, hyperprolactinemia can cause secondary amenorrhea by suppressing
normal GnRH release in the hypothalamus. Affected women may also develop galactorrhea.
However, this patient's low body weight, caloric restriction, and strenuous exercise regimen

are more consistent with FHA.
