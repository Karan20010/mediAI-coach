(Addison disease). In normal individuals, the adrenal glands respond to acute stress (eg,
illness, surgery) with a compensatory increase in glucocorticoid production, but patients with
adrenal insufficiency cannot mount such a response.

Adrenal crisis is characterized by severe hypotension and refractory shock. Associated
symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, weakness, and fever. In addition to aggressive
fluid resuscitation, treatment of adrenal crisis requires immediate glucocorticoid
supplementation with hydrocortisone or dexamethasone. Treatment should begin
immediately without waiting for results of diagnostic studies, and the response is usually rapid.

(Choice A) Antibiotics may be necessary if evidence of infection is found. However, treatment
with glucocorticoids is warranted immediately, whereas the decision to start an antibiotic may
be made when the presence of infection is more clearly established.

(Choices C and D) Dopamine is used in the treatment of shock and refractory cardiac failure.
Epinephrine is used in the treatment of anaphylaxis, severe asthma, and cardiac arrest.
However, hypotension in adrenal crisis is often refractory to vasopressors because
glucocorticoids have a permissive effect on vasoconstriction.

(Choice E) Clinical features of hypothyroid crisis may include hypoglycemia and hypotension,
