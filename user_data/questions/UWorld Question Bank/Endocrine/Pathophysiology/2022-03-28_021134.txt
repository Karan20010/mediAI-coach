dysfunction (ie, central/secondary hypothyroidism) rather than a primary thyroid disorder,
which would cause a compensatory rise in TSH. Central hypothyroidism is much less
common than primary hypothyroidism. However, when it occurs, other hypothalamic-pituitary
systems may be affected and patients may develop deficiencies of other pituitary hormones

(eg, low gonadotropin levels leading to amenorrhea).

The causes of central hypothyroidism are the same as those of hypopituitarism in general.
Sheehan syndrome is ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland and is typically caused by
systemic hypotension during delivery. During pregnancy, the pituitary gland enlarges due to
estrogen-induced hyperplasia of lactotrophs, but the blood supply does not increase
proportionally. Subsequent peripartum hemorrhage with hypotension can cause
underperfusion of the pituitary gland with subsequent ischemic injury.

(Choices A and C) Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is the most common cause of
hypothyroidism. Postpartum thyroiditis is a variant of Hashimoto thyroiditis that occurs within a
year of pregnancy. These disorders cause primary hypothyroidism with elevated TSH levels.

(Choice B) Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder caused by activating antibodies
against the TSH receptor. It presents with elevated T4 and suppressed TSH levels, typically

with a goiter and ocular manifestations (eg, proptosis, lid lag).
