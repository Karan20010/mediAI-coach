This patient has weight gain, proximal muscle weakness, hypertension, and hyperglycemia,
which are prominent features of Cushing syndrome. Screening tests for endogenous Cushing
syndrome include low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing. In normal individuals,
low doses of dexamethasone (a potent glucocorticoid) suppress ACTH and cortisol levels
through negative feedback. However, in endogenous Cushing syndrome, ACTH and cortisol
levels are not suppressed.

The most common causes of Cushing syndrome are shown in the flowchart and can be
categorized on the basis of serum ACTH levels as either ACTH dependent (ACTH is high or
inappropriately normal) or ACTH independent (ACTH is suppressed). In ACTH-dependent
Cushing syndrome, if high-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and cortisol secretion,
a pituitary source of ACTH (ie, ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma) is likely. In contrast,
ectopic ACTH production (eg, from malignant tumors such as small cell lung cancer) is not
suppressed by high-dose dexamethasone (Choice E).

This patient has excessive cortisol production that is suppressed by high-dose but not low-

dose dexamethasone. This is consistent with an ACTH-secreting corticotroph pituitary
adenoma (Cushing disease), the most common cause of endogenous Cushing syndrome.
