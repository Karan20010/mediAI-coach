Aldosterone acts on renal cortical collecting ducts to facilitate the exchange of Na: for K- and
H- in the tubular fluid. As a result, excess production of aldosterone causes renal Na: retention
and excess urinary K- and H- secretion, resulting in hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic
alkalosis. These electrolyte abnormalities can cause paresthesias and muscle weakness in
some patients with primary hyperaldosteronism. Significant extracellular fluid volume
expansion does not occur in primary hyperaldosteronism due to aldosterone escape.

(Choice A) Diarrhea and flushing may be seen in carcinoid syndrome, a rare condition most
often caused by a serotonin (5-HT)-secreting tumor derived from neuroendocrine cells of the
gastrointestinal tract.

(Choice B) Excessive hair growth (hirsutism) can result from excess androgen production.
An adrenal tumor causing androgen hypersecretion would have the functionality of the third
(innermost) layer of the adrenal cortex, the zona reticularis.

(Choice D) Sweating and tremulousness can be caused by excess circulating
catecholamines, which may result from a pheochromocytoma. These tumors arise from the
adrenal medulla rather than the adrenal cortex.

(Choice E) Patients with Cushing syndrome often develop weight gain due to central fat
