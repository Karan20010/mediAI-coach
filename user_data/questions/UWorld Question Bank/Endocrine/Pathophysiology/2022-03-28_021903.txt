¢ Features of hypothyroidism

An elevated creatine kinase (CK) level suggests a myopathic process with myocyte damage
and release of muscle enzymes into the circulation. Common causes of myopathy with
elevated CK include hypothyroidism, muscular dystrophies, inflammatory muscle diseases,
and medications such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.

This patient's fatigue, weight gain, bradycardia, and brittle nails are highly suggestive of
hypothyroid myopathy. Decreased thyroid hormone levels impair muscle glycogen and
triglyceride use and increase oxidative stress, resulting in myocyte injury. Patients typically
presents with myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, decreased exercise tolerance, and
cramping. Myoedema (focal muscle contraction at the site of percussion) and delayed
relaxation of deep tendon reflexes are characteristic findings that are caused by impaired
reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Hypothyroid myopathy and elevations in CK can be the first signs of hypothyroidism and can
