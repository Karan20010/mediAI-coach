source of secretory products in humans, but can secrete a small amount of melanocyte-
stimulating hormone.

Educational objective:

Vasopressin and oxytocin are synthesized within neurons found in the paraventricular and

pituitary. Neurophysins are involved in the posttranslational processing and stabilization of
oxytocin and vasopressin within neurosecretory vesicles during transport to the posterior
pituitary.
