13 net result is hyperglycemia.

15 (Choice A) Steatorrhea results from the decreased secretion of secretin as well as a
decrease in gastrointestinal motility.

(Choice E) Adecrease in gastrin release causes hypochlorhydria.

20 (Choice F) As indicated above, somatostatin does decrease growth hormone secretion from
= the normal pituitary gland, and it does so in growth-hormone-secreting pituitary adenomas.

2 However, somatostatin cannot be used in clinical practice because of its extremely short half-
. life. Somatostatin analogs (octreotide and lanreotide) have a longer plasma half-life and are
26 available for clinical use.

Educational Objective:

Reduced gallbladder contractility, due to decreased cholecystokinin secretion, is responsible

ot for biliary stones in patients with somatostatinoma.
