11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. In addition to
hyperandrogenism, patients have hypertension and hypokalemia (not seen here) due to
increased 11-deoxycorticosterone (a weak mineralocorticoid).

(Choice C) Conversion of pregnenolone to 17-hydroxypregnenolone is impaired with 17
alpha-hydroxylase deficiency. Patients have hypertension and hypokalemia due to increased
mineralocorticoid synthesis and amenorrhea and absent secondary sexual characteristics due
to absent sex hormone production. In addition, 17-OHP and testosterone are decreased with
this disorder.

(Choice E) Aromatase converts testosterone to estradiol. Due to lack of estrogens,
aromatase deficiency results in primary amenorrhea, absent breast development, and virilized
genitalia (eg, clitoromegaly) in girls.

Educational objective:

Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia is due to mild deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, an
enzyme that converts progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone to
11-deoxycortisol. In adolescent girls, it presents with signs of hyperandrogenism (eg,
hirsutism, acne, menstrual irregularities) as well as increased 17-hydroxyprogesterone and
testosterone levels.
