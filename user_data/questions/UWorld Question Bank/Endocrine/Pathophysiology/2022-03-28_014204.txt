pancreatic tumors are common and may lead to recurrent peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison
syndrome). However, almost all patients with MEN type 1 have hyperparathyroidism with
hypercalcemia.

(Choice D) Early menopause (age <40) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular
events, but the effect of the prolactinoma-induced low estrogenic state on cardiovascular risk
in older women is unclear.

(Choice E) Excess growth hormone secretion from a somatotroph pituitary adenoma can lead
to diabetes mellitus due to increased insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. However, adults
typically present with acromegaly.

Educational objective:
Hyperprolactinemia suppresses secretion of GnRH, which leads to reduced estrogen in
women. Low estrogen levels are a risk factor for accelerated bone loss.
