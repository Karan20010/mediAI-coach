12 This patient has hypertension at a young age, suggesting a secondary cause. Her

= weakness and paresthesia indicate an associated electrolyte or acid-base disturbance. These

as findings, along with a suppressed plasma renin, suggest primary mineralocorticoid excess

4 (hyperaldosteronism). The most common causes of primary hyperaldosteronism include

18 unilateral adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome) and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (idiopathic

= hyperaldosteronism), which can be differentiated on abdominal CT scan.

= Hyperaldosteronism is characterized by increased Na: reabsorption in the renal collecting

tubules. This creates a negative charge in the lumen, pulling K- and H: from tubular cells and
25 leading to increased excretion of urinary K- and H-. As a result, hypokalemia is common.

Increased H- excretion by a-intercalated cells promotes bicarbonate production and increased

* activity of the basolateral HCO;/CI- exchanger, resulting in elevated serum bicarbonate and
+ 30 metabolic alkalosis.
Despite the increase in Na: reabsorption, hypernatremia and pedal edema are rarely observed
= due to a phenomenon known as aldosterone escape. The increased intravascular volume
35 causes increased renal blood flow (with resulting pressure natriuresis) and augmented release
= of atrial natriuretic peptide. This limits net sodium retention and prevents the development of
38 overt volume overload and significant hypernatremia.
