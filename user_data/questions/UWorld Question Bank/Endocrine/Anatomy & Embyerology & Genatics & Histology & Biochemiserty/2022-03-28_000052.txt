THF = tetrahydrofolate. " Ouworia
This patient's presentation is most consistent with homocystinuria, the most common inborn
error of methionine metabolism. Most patients present at age 3-10 with ectopia lentis
(dislocated lens). About half of patients have intellectual disability. Other clinical
manifestations include a Marfanoid habitus (eg, elongated limbs, arachnodactyly, scoliosis).
Patients are at high risk for thromboembolic occlusion of both large and small vessels,
especially those of the brain, heart, and kidneys. Thromboembolic complications are the major
cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients.

Homocystinuria is most frequently caused by an autosomal recessive deficiency of
cystathionine beta-synthase, an enzyme that requires pyridoxine (vitamin B6) as a cofactor.
Approximately 50% of affected patients respond to high doses of pyridoxine, which improves
residual enzymatic activity and reduces plasma homocysteine levels. Additional treatment
includes dietary restriction of methionine.

(Choice A) Vitamin C is a necessary cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine
