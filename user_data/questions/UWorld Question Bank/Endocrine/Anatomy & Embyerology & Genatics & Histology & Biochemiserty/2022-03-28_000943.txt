(Choices B, D, and E) Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate by
phosphoglucose isomerase. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate by fructose bisphosphate aldolase.
Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate through the action of
multiple enzymes. These steps are readily reversible and not regulated by insulin.

(Choice F) Oxaloacetate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase during gluconeogenesis; this reaction is downregulated by high insulin levels.

Educational objective:

Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in glycolysis, and the most
potent stimulator of PFK1 is fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. Insulin increases production of
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK2), thereby stimulating glycolysis.

effects on glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes.
