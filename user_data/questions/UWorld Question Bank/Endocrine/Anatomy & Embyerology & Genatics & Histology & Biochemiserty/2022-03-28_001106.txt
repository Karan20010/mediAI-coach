This patient has cataracts, an opacification of the lens of the eye that can lead to blindness,
likely a result of long-standing hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
Certain cells (eg, retinal, endothelial, lens, renal mesangial, Schwann) are more vulnerable to
hyperglycemia-induced damage because they are unable to regulate glucose transport when

circulating levels are high.

Multiple metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced tissue

damage:

¢ Advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs): Glucose can nonenzymatically attach
to proteins and lipids, forming reversible glycosylation products that slowly stabilize into
irreversible products. Under hyperglycemic conditions, AGEs accumulate and facilitate
deposition of LDL in blood vessel walls and inflammatory cell invasion that causes
atherosclerosis and microangiopathic complications. High glucose levels in the aqueous
humor may also induce nonenzymatic glycation of lens proteins, which contributes to

cataract formation.

Polyol pathway overactivity: The enzyme aldose reductase converts glucose to
sorbitol, which is then oxidized to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. With
hyperglycemia, formation of sorbitol occurs faster than its metabolism to fructose, resulting
