Educational objective:

Chromaffin cells are modified neuroendocrine cells derived from the neural crest. Chromaffin
cells in the adrenal medulla are stimulated by acetylcholine released by sympathetic
preganglionic neurons and secrete catecholamines directly into the bloodstream to amplify
sympathetic nervous system activity.
