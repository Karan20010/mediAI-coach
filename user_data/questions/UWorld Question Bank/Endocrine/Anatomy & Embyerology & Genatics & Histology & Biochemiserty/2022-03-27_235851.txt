This infant has symptoms typical of maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), an autosomal
recessive disorder. MSUD is characterized by mutations in branched-chain alpha-keto acid
dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), an enzyme necessary for breaking down the branched-
chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine.

Defective BCKDC leads to accumulation of BCAAs in serum and peripheral tissues, resulting
in neurotoxicity (eg, seizures, irritability, lethargy, and poor feeding) that can be life-
threatening if untreated. A metabolite of isoleucine also gives the urine a distinctive odor

described as sweet.

Treatment for MSUD involves restricting BCAAs in the diet. BCKDC (in addition to pyruvate
dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) requires 5 cofactors: thiamine,
lipoate, and coenzymes A, FAD, and NAD. Because MSUD has a spectrum of phenotypes,
patients who have only a mild reduction in BCKDC activity may improve with high-dose
thiamine treatment; however, most patients still require lifelong dietary restriction.

(Choice A) Treatment of most urea cycle disorders involves supplemental arginine. Arginine
administration increases production of downstream water-soluble intermediate metabolites
(eg, ornithine, citrulline), facilitating nitrogen disposal and decreasing plasma ammonia levels.
