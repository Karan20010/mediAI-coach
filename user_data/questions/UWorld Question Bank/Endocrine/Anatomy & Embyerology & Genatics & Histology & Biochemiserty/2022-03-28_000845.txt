The adrenal gland is made up of an outer cortex (divided into 3 zones) and an inner medulla:

1. The zona glomerulosa is the outermost zone of the cortex and is composed of cells
arranged in rounded or arched clusters (glomus is Latin for ball) that secrete
mineralocorticoid hormones (primarily aldosterone).

2. The zona fasciculata is the middle zone and contains foamy-appearing cells in columns
(fascis is Latin for bundle or stack) that secrete glucocorticoid hormones (primarily
cortisol).

3. The zona reticularis is the inner zone of the cortex and contains cells in anastomosing
cords (rete is Latin for net) that secrete androgens.

4. The adrenal medulla is sharply demarcated from the cortex and is composed of chromaffin
cells with a deeply basophilic cytoplasm.

Chromaffin cells are modified neuroendocrine cells derived from the neural crest. They are
stimulated by acetylcholine released by sympathetic preganglionic neurons and secrete

catecholamines (80% epinephrine, 20% norepinephrine) directly into the bloodstream to

amplify sympathetic nervous system activity.
