(Choice B) Lipoxygenase is an enzyme involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and is
responsible for the arm of that pathway that synthesizes leukotrienes.

(Choice C) Phospholipase C is activated in the G-protein/inositol triphosphate (IP;)/calcium
second messenger system. Hormone-receptor binding activates a G-protein that in turn
activates phospholipase C to degrade phospholipids into IP, and diacylglycerol. Both
diacylglycerol and the increased intracellular calcium caused by IP; lead to protein kinase C

activation.

(Choice D) Protein kinase A is the primary intracellular effector enzyme in the G-
protein/adenylate cyclase second messenger system. Glucagon acts through this pathway to
stimulate glycogen breakdown. Protein kinase A activates glycogen phosphorylase via
activation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase.

Educational objective:

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that acts via receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to increase the
synthesis of glycogen, proteins, fatty acids, and nucleic acids. Tyrosine
kinase/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase stimulation promotes glycogen synthesis by activating
protein phosphatase, an enzyme that dephosphorylates (activates) glycogen synthase.
