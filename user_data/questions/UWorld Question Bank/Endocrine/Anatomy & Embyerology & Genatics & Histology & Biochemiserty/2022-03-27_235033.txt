and growth hormone. Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary is regulated by
substances released from the median eminence into the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal
vessels.
(Choice C) Although head trauma is a frequent cause of central DI, traumatic damage to the

kidneys does not result in nephrogenic DI. Furthermore, this patient's large increase in urine
concentration following ADH administration is more suggestive of central DI.

(Choice D) Isolated posterior pituitary damage most often causes transient central DI
because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact and can undergo axonal
regeneration to allow adequate ADH release into the circulation.

(Choice E) Thalamic nuclei are involved in relaying sensory and motor signals to the cerebral
cortex and in regulating alertness and consciousness.

Educational objective:

Injury to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal
neurosurgery, suprasellar masses) can result in central diabetes insipidus (DI). Damage to the
posterior pituitary gland typically causes transient DI, whereas damage to the hypothalamic
nuclei often causes permanent DI.
