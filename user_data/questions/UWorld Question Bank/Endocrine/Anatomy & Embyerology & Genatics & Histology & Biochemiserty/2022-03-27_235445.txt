¢ GLUT-3 is involved in placental and neuronal glucose transport.
¢ GLUT-5 is a fructose transporter found in spermatocytes and the gastrointestinal tract.

(Choices A, B, and C) Glucose uptake by hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, neurons, and
enterocytes primarily involves insulin-independent glucose transporters and does not
substantially change with insulin concentration.

(Choice E) Both skeletal myocytes and adipocytes express GLUT-4 and would show
increased glucose uptake in response to insulin.

Educational objective:

Glucose transport protein (GLUT)-4 is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter expressed in
skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes that translocates to the plasma membrane in response to
increasing insulin levels. In contrast, GLUT-1, 2, 3, and 5 are always present on the plasma
membrane and constitutively transport glucose in an insulin-independent manner.
