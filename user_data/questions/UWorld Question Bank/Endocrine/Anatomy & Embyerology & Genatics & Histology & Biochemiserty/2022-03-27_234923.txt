This patient's pathologic specimen shows normal thyroid follicles containing colloid, consistent
with a lingual thyroid. The thyroid gland is formed from an outpouching (evagination) of the
pharyngeal epithelium and subsequently descends to the lower neck anterior to the upper
trachea and larynx. The lowest part of the evagination forms the thyroid gland and the
remaining portion forms the thyroglossal duct, which extends from the foramen cecum on the
dorsal surface of the tongue to the superior border of the thyroid isthmus.

Due to failure of migration, the thyroid can reside anywhere along the thyroglossal duct's
usual path, including the tongue (lingual thyroid). Enlargement of a lingual thyroid can lead to
obstructive symptoms (eg, dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea), typically during times of
heightened thyroid stimulation (eg, puberty, pregnancy). Sometimes, this lingual thyroid is the
only thyroid tissue in the body, so hypothyroidism can occur if it is removed.

(Choice A) Apoptosis is the process of programmed cell death and is important in regulating
the turnover of cells. Failure of apoptosis during fetal development can result in conditions
such as duodenal atresia and syndactyly (ie, fusion of adjacent digits).

(Choice B) Differentiation is the formation of mature cells from undifferentiated precursor cells
(eg, formation of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets from bone marrow stem
cells). Although thyroid cells do differentiate after their descent from the pharynx, defective
