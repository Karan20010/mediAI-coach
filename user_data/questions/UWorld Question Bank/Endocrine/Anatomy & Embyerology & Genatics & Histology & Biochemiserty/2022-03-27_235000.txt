The superior thyroid artery (a branch of the external carotid artery) and the inferior thyroid
artery (a branch of the thyrocervical trunk) provide the blood supply to the thyroid and
parathyroid glands. The superior thyroid artery and vein and external branch of the
superior laryngeal nerve course together in a neurovascular triad that originates superior to
the thyroid gland and lateral to the thyroid cartilage. The external branch is at risk of injury
during thyroidectomy as it courses just deep to the superior thyroid artery.

The cricothyroid muscle is the only muscle innervated by this nerve. It originates on the
cricoid cartilage and inserts on the lower border of the thyroid cartilage. The cricothyroid
muscle acts to tense the vocal cords, and denervation injury may cause a low, hoarse voice
with limited range of pitch. The internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve does not
innervate any muscles but provides sensory innervation to the laryngeal mucosa above the
vocal folds.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) The remaining laryngeal muscles are innervated by the recurrent
laryngeal nerves, which also provide sensory innervation to the larynx below the vocal folds.
The recurrent laryngeal nerves lie posterior to the thyroid, near the inferior thyroid arteries.
These nerves can be injured during thyroidectomy but do not run with the superior thyroid

artery at the superior pole of the thyroid.
