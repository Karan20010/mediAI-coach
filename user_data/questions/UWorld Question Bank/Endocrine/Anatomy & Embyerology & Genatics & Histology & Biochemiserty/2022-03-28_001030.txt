(Choice A) Failure of the anterior neuropore to close leads to neural tube defects such as
anencephaly. Neural tube defects can be prevented with maternal folic acid supplementation.

(Choice B) The foramen cecum is a depression on the tongue that represents the
embryological remnant of the superior end of the obliterated thyroglossal duct. A persistent
duct results in a thyroglossal cyst that presents as a midline neck mass.

(Choice C) Rathke pouch represents an invaginated oral ectoderm that eventually develops
into the anterior pituitary. Craniopharyngiomas arise from remnants of this pouch and can
result in hypopituitarism, hydrocephalus, and diabetes insipidus, but not hypocalcemia.

(Choice D) The second branchial cleft (ie, second pharyngeal groove) is normally obliterated
in utero. Persistence leads to a branchial cleft cyst between the angle of the mandible and
sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Educational objective:

DiGeorge syndrome results from maldevelopment of the third (inferior parathyroid and thymus)
and fourth (superior parathyroid) pharyngeal/branchial pouches. Subsequent parathyroid and
thymic hypoplasia results in hypocalcemia and T cell deficiency.
