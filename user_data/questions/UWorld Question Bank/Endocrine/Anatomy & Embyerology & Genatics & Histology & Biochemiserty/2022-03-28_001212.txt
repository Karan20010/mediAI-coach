- Gaucher disease, Bloom syndrome), is more common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population

7 than in the general population. The increased risk for rare and often life-threatening genetic

offered genetic counseling and testing before they conceive a child.

Â® (Choices A and B) Hurler and Hunter syndromes are mucopolysaccharidoses characterized
15 by the accumulation of heparan and dermatan sulfate, which are glycosaminoglycans (ie,
polysaccharides, not phospholipids). Both disorders can cause dysostosis multiplex (eg,

18 abnormally shaped bones, enlarged skull), coarse facial features, and cardiac dysfunction.
Corneal clouding is unique to Hurler syndrome.

= (Choice C) Fabry disease is characterized by decreased metabolic degradation of

23 globotriaosylceramide to glucocerebroside, not ceramide. Disease manifestations include

* neuropathic pain and angiokeratomas in adolescence and multiorgan (eg, renal,

26 cerebrovascular, cardiac) involvement in adulthood.
