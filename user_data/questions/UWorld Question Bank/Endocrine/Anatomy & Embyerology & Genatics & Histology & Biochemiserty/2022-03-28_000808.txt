One of the objectives for the national Healthy People 2020 initiative is to reduce the
prevalence of tobacco smoking in adults from 20% in 2008 to less than 12% by 2020.

Tobacco use, especially smoking, is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in
the United States. In addition to its numerous direct adverse effects, tobacco smoking also
substantially increases the risk for macrovascular (eg, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) and
microvascular (eg, retinopathy, nephropathy) complications of diabetes mellitus. These
complications significantly increase mortality, primarily by increasing the risk of MI. The risk of
Ml-associated mortality begins to decrease immediately upon smoking cessation. However, it
takes several tobacco-free years before the risk returns to baseline, especially in patients with
a long history of smoking. In addition, smokers with diabetes have a higher likelihood of
developing hypercholesterolemia, poor glycemic control, and end-stage renal disease. It
appears that smoking not only worsens the complications of diabetes but also increases the
likelihood of developing diabetes in the first place, thus highlighting the importance of
prevention and early cessation.

(Choice A) Fecal occult blood testing screens for colorectal cancer and improves mortality
through earlier detection. Even so, the mortality benefit is much lower than that achieved by

smoking cessation.
