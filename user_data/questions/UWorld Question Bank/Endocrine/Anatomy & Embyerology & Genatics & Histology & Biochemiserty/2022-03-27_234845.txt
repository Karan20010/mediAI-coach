A 13-year-old boy is brought to the clinic due to progressive difficulty with breathing,
hoarseness, and dysphagia. The symptoms began insidiously 6 months ago but have rapidly
become worse in the last 4 weeks. The patient has no associated skin rash, pharyngeal pain,
fever, weight loss, or loss of appetite. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes
no medications. He is up to date on scheduled vaccinations. The patient's parents and
siblings have no history of significant health problems. Vital signs are normal, and he is at
70th percentile for height and weight. Oropharyngeal examination reveals a large, red lingual
mass. The patient subsequently undergoes excision of the mass; histopathologic preparation
of the recovered tissue is shown in the image below.
