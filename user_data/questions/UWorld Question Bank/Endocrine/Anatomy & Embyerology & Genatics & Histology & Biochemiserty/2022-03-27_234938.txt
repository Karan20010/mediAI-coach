changes, heat or cold intolerance, hoarseness, or dyspnea. Medical history is notable for mild
hypertension, for which she takes appropriate medications. The patient does not use tobacco
or alcohol. Physical examination shows a 3-cm, firm nodule in the right thyroid lobe and
enlarged, right cervical lymph nodes. TSH is normal, and fine-needle aspiration of the nodule
