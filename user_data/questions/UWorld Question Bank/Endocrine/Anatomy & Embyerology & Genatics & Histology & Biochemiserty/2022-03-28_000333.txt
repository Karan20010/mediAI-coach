After about 12-18 hours of fasting, the body's glycogen stores are depleted and
gluconeogenesis is required to maintain blood glucose levels. As fasting continues, the body
limits its reliance on gluconeogenesis in an effort to conserve protein and resorts instead to
ketone body synthesis. Ketone bodies are generated in the liver from fatty acids and yield
energy when converted to acetyl CoA in the mitochondria of target cells.

The brain, kidneys, cardiac muscle, and skeletal muscle (Choices A, C, D & E) can all utilize
ketones for energy. In the initial stages of fasting, the heart and skeletal muscle consume
primarily ketone bodies to preserve glucose for the brain, but in prolonged starvation, even the
brain will utilize ketone bodies for the majority of its energy needs. However, erythrocytes
cannot use ketone bodies for energy because they lack mitochondria. The liver is also unable
to utilize ketone bodies for energy because it lacks the enzyme succinyl CoA-acetoacetate
CoA transferase (thiophorase), which is required to convert acetoacetate to acetoacetyl CoA.

Educational objective:

When glycogen stores are depleted during fasting, ketone bodies are produced in the liver and
can be used as an energy source in the mitochondria of peripheral tissues. The brain
preferentially uses glucose, but will utilize ketones for most of its energy needs during
prolonged starvation. Erythrocytes lack mitochondria and are unable to use ketones.
