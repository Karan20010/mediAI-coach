(Choice A) Infants who are fed honey or exposed to spores from the soil are at risk for
infantile botulism, which presents with constipation and flaccid paralysis. A large anterior
fontanelle, umbilical hernia, and macroglossia are not seen.

(Choice B) Hypotonia and hypothyroidism are features of Down syndrome. However, the
absence of other dysmorphic features (eg, upslanting palpebral fissures, bilateral epicanthal
folds, single palmar crease) makes Down syndrome unlikely in this patient.

(Choice C) Galactosemia is caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency.
Patients with this condition present with jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and lethargy after
ingesting galactose in breast milk or formula in the first few days of life. This patient was
previously breastfeeding well and has no hepatomegaly.

(Choice D) Hirschsprung disease is caused by abnormal migration of neural crest cells into
the rectosigmoid colon. The lack of ganglion cells in this colon segment impedes
gastrointestinal motility, resulting in failed meconium passage and bilious emesis in a newborn.

(Choice F) Phenylketonuria is most commonly caused by phenylalanine hydroxylase
deficiency, resulting in hyperphenylalaninemia. It presents with developmental delay, light
pigmentation, and a musty body odor.
