: ¢ Polyol pathway overactivity: The enzyme aldose reductase converts glucose to

: sorbitol, which is then oxidized to fructose by the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase. With

8 hyperglycemia, formation of sorbitol occurs faster than its metabolism to fructose, resulting
° in its accumulation. Sorbitol increases the osmotic pressure in tissues and stimulates the
it influx of water, leading to osmotic cellular injury. In addition, oxidative stress resulting
aa from the depletion of NADPH (aldose reductase consumes NADPH) also contributes to

14 cataract formation and other diabetic complications such as retinopathy, peripheral

neuropathy, and nephropathy.

= (Choices A and B) Aldose reductase also catalyzes the conversion of galactose (obtained
19 from dietary lactose) to galactitol, but sorbitol dehydrogenase is incapable of oxidizing

: * galactitol to its corresponding keto sugar (tagatose, a food sweetener). In galactosemia
22 (galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency), excess galactitol is produced, which

causes cataracts in newborns.

cad (Choice D) In the hexose monophosphate shunt, glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-

26

7 phosphogluconolactone by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),

. generating the reducing equivalent NADPH. G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic anemia
