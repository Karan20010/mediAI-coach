likely a result of long-standing hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
Certain cells (eg, retinal, endothelial, lens, renal mesangial, Schwann) are more vulnerable to
hyperglycemia-induced damage because they are unable to regulate glucose transport when
circulating levels are high.

Multiple metabolic pathways are involved in the pathogenesis of hyperglycemia-induced tissue
damage:
