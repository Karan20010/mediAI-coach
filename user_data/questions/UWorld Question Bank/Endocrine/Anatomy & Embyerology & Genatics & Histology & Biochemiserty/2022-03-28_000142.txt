I

converts ATP to cyclic AMP, which subsequently activates protein kinase A.

(Choices C and D) Various hormones (eg, GnRH, TRH, angiotensin Il, ADH [V1 receptor])
function by binding to G protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C. Activated
phospholipase C hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to inositol triphosphate (IP,)
and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP; mobilizes calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, and DAG
directly activates protein kinase C.

Educational objective:

Growth hormone binds to cell surface receptors, leading to intracellular activation of the JAK-
STAT pathway. Cytokines (eg, interferon) and hematopoietic growth factors (eg,
erythropoietin, G-CSF) also use this pathway.
