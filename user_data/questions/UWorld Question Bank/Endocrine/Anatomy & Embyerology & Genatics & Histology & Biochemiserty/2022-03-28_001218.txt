Question Id: 1990 Tutorial Lab Values

(Choice C) Fabry disease is characterized by decreased metabolic degradation of
globotriaosylceramide to glucocerebroside, not ceramide. Disease manifestations include
neuropathic pain and angiokeratomas in adolescence and multiorgan (eg, renal,
cerebrovascular, cardiac) involvement in adulthood.

(Choice E) Small stature and infertility with a predisposition to malignancy and a classic sun-
sensitive facial rash are typical signs of Bloom syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder
that leads to chromosomal instability, not phospholipid accumulation.

Educational objective:

Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that has a much higher incidence in
the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population. It is characterized by
sphingomyelinase deficiency and sphingomyelin (phospholipid) accumulation, which cause
neurologic regression, hepatosplenomegaly, and retinal opacification (ie, cherry-red macula).
