A 1-week-old boy is brought to the emergency department with poor feeding, lethargy, and
unusual "muscle movements" involving the left thumb and hand over the last 2 days. The
patient's mother had appropriate prenatal care, a normal pregnancy, and took no medications
other than prenatal vitamins. The infant's vital signs are normal, but unusual flexion of the left
wrist and thumb and extension of the fingers are observed with cuff blood pressure
measurement. Physical examination reveals a hypoplastic mandible, low-set ears, bifid uvula,
and cleft palate. A chest x-ray reveals decreased soft-tissue attenuation in the right anterior
mediastinum. These findings most likely suggest impaired development of which of the
following embryonic structures?

A. Anterior neuropore (3%)

B. Foramen cecum (1%)

C. Rathke pouch (5%)

D. Second pharyngeal cleft (12%)
