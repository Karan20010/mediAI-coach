cells). Although thyroid cells do differentiate after their descent from the pharynx, defective

(Choice C) Fusion is the joining of two opposing tissues to form one continuous structure.
Disruption of this process leads to a variety of birth defects, including cleft palate,
atrioventricular septal defects, pancreatic divisum, and neural tube defects.

proliferation during fetal development can result in organ hypoplasia (eg, thymus abnormalities
in DiGeorge syndrome).
