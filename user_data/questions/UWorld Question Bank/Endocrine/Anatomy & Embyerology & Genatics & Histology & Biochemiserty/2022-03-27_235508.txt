Question Id: 994
Glucagon exerts its effects through G protein-coupled receptors using the adenylate cyclase
second messenger system. G protein is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta, and
gamma subunits associated with the intracellular domain of these transmembrane receptors.
The alpha subunit of the inactivated G protein is bound to GDP. On receptor activation, the
alpha subunit undergoes a conformational change, which releases GDP and binds GTP. GTP
binding allows the alpha subunit to dissociate from the remainder of the G protein complex.

There are multiple subtypes of alpha G proteins, each with different secondary effects. A
specific alpha subunit known as G, (present in glucagon, TSH, and PTH receptor complexes)
activates adenylate cyclase when released from the G protein complex. Adenylate cyclase
converts ATP to cAMP, which activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates
specific serine/threonine residues in various enzymes, leading to their activation or
deactivation. Protein kinase A also phosphorylates proteins that bind to the regulatory regions

of genes on DNA.

(Choice A) cGMP activates protein kinase G, which mediates a number of intracellular effects
(eg, smooth muscle relaxation, platelet activation, sperm metabolism). cGMP is inactivated by
cGMP phosphodiesterase, which cleaves cGMP in the corpus cavernosum of the penis and
regulates penile erection. Drugs that inhibit c6GMP-specific phosphodiesterase (eg, sildenafil)
