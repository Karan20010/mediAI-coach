regular infant formula) leads to neonatal jaundice, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and frequently
Escherichia coli sepsis. Dietary restriction of galactose is the mainstay of treatment.

(Choice C) Homocystinuria is an autosomal recessive disorder marked by a defect in
cystathionine beta-synthase, resulting in elevated levels of homocysteine and methionine.
Patients have marfanoid appearance (eg, long limbs, arachnodactyly), developmental delay,
lens dislocation, and increased risk for thromboembolism. Restriction of methionine for these

patients is one aspect of therapy.

(Choice D) Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by
phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency, leading to hyperphenylalaninemia. Untreated patients
develop intellectual disability, seizures, decreased hair and skin pigmentation, and a musty

odor.

(Choice E) Dietary tyrosine restriction may be beneficial for patients with hypertyrosinemia
(progressive liver and renal disease) or alkaptonuria (pigmented osteoarthritis).

Educational objective:

Maple syrup urine disease classically presents within the first few days of life with irritability,
