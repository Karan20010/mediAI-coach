synthesis is likely to be upregulated in metabolic states in which fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
concentration is increased.

(Choice C) The conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is catalyzed
by the enzyme PFK-1. This enzyme is allosterically activated by high levels of fructose-2,6-

bisphosphate, and so conversion would be increased.

(Choice D) Glycogen formation is stimulated by increased levels of insulin and glucose-6-
phosphate. Because elevated insulin levels also increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
formation, the rise of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels in hepatocytes is typically concurrent
with increased glycogen synthesis.

(Choice E) The rise in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate accelerates glycolysis, leading to increased
conversion of NAD: to NADH.

Educational objective:

Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6BP) activates phosphofructokinase-1 (increasing glycolysis)
and inhibits fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (decreasing gluconeogenesis). F2,6BP
concentration is regulated by a bifunctional enzyme complex: phosphofructokinase-2
increases F2,6BP levels in response to insulin, and fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase decreases

F2,6BP levels in response to glucagon.
