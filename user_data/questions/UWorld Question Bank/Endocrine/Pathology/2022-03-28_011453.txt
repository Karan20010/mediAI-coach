deficiency) anemia and an elevated gastrin level, is likely due to a gastrin-secreting pancreatic
tumor (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). Although most gastrinomas are sporadic, 20%-30%
occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). This autosomal
dominant disorder is most often due to mutations of the MEN1 gene (menin protein) and is
characterized by parathyroid adenomas, pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors
(the 3 Ps).

Patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome or other pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors should be
assessed for symptoms or family history of other MEN1 manifestations. Potential associated
conditions include primary hyperparathyroidism (eg, hypercalcemia, constipation, kidney
stones) and pituitary adenomas (eg, headaches, visual field defects).

(Choices A and C) Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) is an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by multiple tumors, including hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytoma, and
renal cell carcinoma. Plexiform neurofibromas are large aggregates of neuronal cells,
supporting cells, and connective tissue that are seen in approximately 30% of patients with
neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although an increased incidence of pancreatic endocrine

tumors has been reported in both VHL and NF1, these associations are much less frequent
