¢ Low ACTH levels are seen with autonomous adrenal production of cortisol (eg, adrenal
adenoma or carcinoma) or exogenous glucocorticoid exposure due to feedback
suppression

¢ High ACTH levels occur with pituitary adenomas (ie, Cushing disease) or ectopic ACTH
production by nonpituitary tumors, which can be further distinguished with the high-dose
dexamethasone suppression test:

© Pituitary sources of ACTH are only relatively resistant to feedback inhibition, and high
doses of dexamethasone will suppress ACTH and cortisol levels (Choice A)

© Nonpituitary ectopic sources of ACTH (eg, small cell lung cancer) are completely
resistant to feedback inhibition, and ACTH and cortisol will remain elevated following
high doses of dexamethasone

This patient's rapid symptom onset, heavy smoking history, and lung mass are consistent with
paraneoplastic CS, likely due to small cell lung cancer. ACTH and cortisol production will
likely be unchanged following high-dose dexamethasone.

(Choices B and C) In normal individuals, dexamethasone suppresses ACTH release from the
pituitary. In patients with abnormal pituitary or ectopic ACTH production, dexamethasone aiveteV
