Educational objective:

Acute pituitary hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy) is characterized by severe headache,
bitemporal hemianopsia (compression of the optic chiasm), and ophthalmoplegia
(compression of the oculomotor nerve [CN Ill]). It usually occurs in a preexisting pituitary
adenoma. Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency that requires urgent treatment with
glucocorticoids to prevent acute adrenal crisis and circulatory collapse.
