= autonomous cortisol production (ie, ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) is almost always due
5 to a primary adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma). Regardless of the source, excess
: cortisol in a patient with intact hypothalamus-pituitary function suppresses ACTH and patients
8 do not develop hyperpigmentation.
‚Äù (Choice C) Given this patient's large lung mass and associated weight loss (instead of weight
= gain and central fat deposition), paraneoplastic ACTH secretion is more likely than an ACTH-
13 producing pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease).
: = (Choice D) Metastasis to the hypothalamus would likely cause endocrine insufficiency
* [ae resulting from a lack of trophic hormones to the anterior pituitary. Decreased production of
= corticotropin-releasing hormone would lead to central adrenal insufficiency, not
= hypercortisolism.
24 (Choice E) The adrenal glands are a common site of metastasis. If significant destruction of
, the adrenal cortical tissue occurs bilaterally, adrenal insufficiency may result. A subsequent
228 increase of ACTH may cause hyperpigmentation; however, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency
: = (eg, hypotension) would be expected, as opposed to the symptoms of cortisol excess seen in
27 this patient.
