(Choices C and D) Follicular neoplasms lack the characteristic nuclear features and
psammoma bodies found in papillary carcinoma. Distinguishing a benign follicular adenoma
from a well-differentiated follicular carcinoma depends on the presence of vascular or capsular
invasion, which cannot be determined on a fine-needle aspiration specimen.

(Choice E) Medullary thyroid carcinoma appears histologically as polygonal or spindle-
shaped cells with a slightly granular cytoplasm that stains for calcitonin. Extracellular amyloid
deposits consisting of calcitonin polypeptide may also be seen. Medullary thyroid cancer is a
component of multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B.

Educational objective:

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer. Characteristic
microscopic features include large cells with nuclei containing finely dispersed chromatin,
giving them an empty or ground-glass appearance (ie, Orphan Annie eye), as well as
intranuclear inclusions and nuclear grooves.
