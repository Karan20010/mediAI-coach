This patient with painful enlargement of the thyroid gland has subacute granulomatous

thyroiditis (SGT), also called de Quervain thyroiditis. SGT typically follows an acute viral

illness and is thought to be due to a cross-reacting immune response against viral proteins or

tissue antigens released during cellular injury. Patients may experience a transient

hyperthyroid phase (elevated thyroxine [T4], suppressed TSH) due to release of stored

thyroid hormone. Radioiodine uptake is decreased in SGT as the low TSH levels suppress

synthesis of new thyroid hormone. The disease is self-limited and resolves in <6 weeks,

although patients may have a brief hypothyroid phase before returning to a euthyroid state.

SGT is initially characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate with microabscess formation, which, as
the disease progresses, is replaced by a more generalized inflammatory infiltrate with
macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. The inflammatory process is reflected by
elevated serum acute-phase markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate).

(Choice A) Papillary thyroid cancer is characterized by branching papillary structures with
concentric calcifications (psammoma bodies). This malignancy would typically present with
nodular enlargement rather than acute pain and tenderness.

(Choice B) Riedel thyroiditis is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland that

extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and nontender.
