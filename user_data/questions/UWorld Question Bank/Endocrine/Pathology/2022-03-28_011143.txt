Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency have
impaired cortisol synthesis. Subsequent lack of feedback causes the hypothalamus to
increase adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the anterior pituitary. This
results in stimulation of the adrenal cortex and adrenal androgen overproduction (eg,
dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione).

Treatment of 21-hydroxylase deficiency involves low (ie, physiologic) doses of exogenous
corticosteroids that suppress ACTH secretion via negative feedback mechanisms. Without
excess ACTH stimulation, androgen production by the adrenal cortex decreases.

(Choice B) Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase impairs cortisol synthesis; further suppression of
cortisol production could precipitate an adrenal crisis (eg, hypoglycemia, hypotension).

(Choice C) Luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulates the testes to produce testosterone.
Decreasing LH levels would decrease testosterone production by the testes but would not
affect excess adrenal androgen production in CAH.

(Choice D) Hyperprolactinemia disrupts GnRH secretion, which leads to decreased
testosterone production and hypogonadism. Prolactin suppression would further elevate
testosterone levels and would not be beneficial in this patient.
