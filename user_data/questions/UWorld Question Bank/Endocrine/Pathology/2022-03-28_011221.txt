Patients are usually hypotensive due to dehydration and the vasodilatory effects of VIP.

(Choice F) Diabetes mellitus is present in the majority of patients with glucagonoma, most
likely due to excessive hepatic glucose production. Insulin levels tend to be normal but can be
elevated secondary to hyperglycemia and glucagon-induced stimulation of the pancreatic beta
cells.

(Choice G) Zinc deficiency causes erythematous skin lesions (mainly around body orifices)
that are predominantly vesicular and pustular. Other features include hypogonadism, impaired
taste and smell, night blindness, and impaired wound healing. Although the skin lesions in
zinc deficiency can resemble necrolytic migratory erythema, this patient's lack of additional
findings and her recent diabetes mellitus diagnosis make glucagonoma more likely.

Educational objective:

Glucagonoma presents with hyperglycemia (often as newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus) and
necrolytic migratory erythema (blistering erythematous plaques with central clearing) affecting
the groin, face, and extremities. The diagnosis is made by detecting elevated glucagon levels.
