This euthyroid patient has a slowly enlarging, firm, painless thyroid nodule and fine-needle
aspiration (FNA) results indicative of a follicular neoplasm (eg, numerous follicular cells and
microfollicles). Most follicular thyroid neoplasms are benign follicular adenomas, but 15%-30%
can be malignant follicular carcinomas. Both types of follicular neoplasms have a similar
appearance on ultrasound and FNA.

Differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions can only be accomplished by
histologic examination of the entire tumor (eg, thyroidectomy).

¢ Follicular adenomas (the most common benign thyroid neoplasm) display numerous
neoplastic follicular cells and microfollicles on histology but are completely encapsulated.

¢ In contrast, follicular thyroid carcinomas are characterized by invasion of the tumor
capsule and/or surrounding blood vessels.

This propensity of follicular thyroid carcinomas to invade surrounding blood vessels accounts

for their tendency to metastasize via hematogenous spread to distant tissues (eg, bone,
lung).
(Choice A) Medullary thyroid carcinomas can develop sporadically or in patients with an

inherited RET proto-oncogene mutation (eg, multiple endocrine neoplasia 2a or 2b). In

patients with this germline mutation. C-cell hyperplasia is often found as a precursor to a
