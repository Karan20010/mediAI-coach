Explanation

The lesion pictured is a xanthelasma, a type of xanthoma usually found on the medial eyelids.
Hyperlipidemia and/or dyslipidemia can result in xanthomas (including xanthelasmas).
Xanthelasmas are dermal accumulations of benign-appearing macrophages with abundant,
finely vacuolated (foamy) cytoplasm containing cholesterol (free and esterified), phospholipids,
and triglycerides. Due in part to insulin resistance promoting increased VLDL production,
diabetics may develop a secondary Type IV or V hyperlipidemia (increased VLDL,
chylomicrons) and/or a secondary diabetic dyslipidemia with elevated LDL cholesterol and low
HDL cholesterol. Thus, in order to determine the type of this patient's lipid disorder and to rule
out underlying diabetes, her serum lipids and blood glucose should be measured.

(Choice A) Although this patient may be at increased risk for coronary artery disease due to
hyperlipidemia or dyslipidemia, she does not currently have symptoms of myocardial
infarction. Her current management should be focused on treating her lipid disorder.

(Choice C) The first step in managing this patient is to establish what type of lipid abnormality
she has based upon her serum lipid levels and lipoprotein profile. If the results are consistent

with an obstructive liver and/or biliary system lesion producing cholestasis and
