complications in young patients include reduced peak bone mass, which may lead to early-
onset osteoporosis.

(Choice A) Low circulating estrogen levels despite increased GnRH and FSH secretion are
consistent with a primary ovarian disorder (eg, primary ovarian insufficiency [POI],
menopause). POI is associated with Turner syndrome and prior chemoradiation, not anorexia
nervosa.

(Choice B) Pituitary dysfunction, which includes anatomic (eg, prolactinoma) and functional
disorders (eg, hypopituitarism due to infarction [Sheehan syndrome]), can cause
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and amenorrhea characterized by increased GnRH, low
FSH and LH, and low estrogen. However, prolactinomas typically present with additional

Clinical features (eg, bilateral galactorrhea), and Sheehan syndrome is usually associated with
prior hemorrhage, particularly obstetric hemorrhage.

Educational objective:

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and
occurs due to decreased amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing
hormone release from the hypothalamus, which in turn leads to low FSH, LH, and estrogen
levels. Causes include anorexia nervosa (eg, distorted body image, restricted diet, lanugo), ctivate V
