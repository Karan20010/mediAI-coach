This patient has multiple signs and symptoms of primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) (also
known as Addison disease), including abdominal pain, weight loss, salt craving, orthostasis
(dizziness on standing), and electrolyte disturbance. PAI usually results from autoimmune
destruction of the bilateral adrenal cortex and is more likely to occur in patients with a personal
or family history of autoimmune disease (eg, Hashimoto thyroiditis). Because all 3 layers of
the adrenal cortex are affected, clinical manifestations result from a reduction in circulating
mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens.

Reduced aldosterone, the principal mineralocorticoid in the body, leads to markedly
decreased sodium absorption by the renal collecting tubule principal cells with consequent
retention of potassium (leading to hyperkalemia). The decrease in total body sodium results
in hypovolemia and hypotension that may lead to renal insufficiency. The hypovolemia
provides nonosmotic stimulus for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion, which stimulates
water retention and leads to hyponatremia.

Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid in the body, normally inhibits ADH secretion; therefore,
reduced cortisol further contributes to hyponatremia. Cortisol is also necessary for the
synthesis of epinephrine in the adrenal medulla; the consequent reduction in circulating
epinephrine leads to a compensatory increase in norepinephrine to increase vascular tone in
