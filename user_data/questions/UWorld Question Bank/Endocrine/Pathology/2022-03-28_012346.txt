testicular atrophy) seen in this patient.

(Choice B) Intensive exercise could result in elevated myoglobin secondary to
rhabdomyolysis, but the hematocrit level should not be changed by exercise.

(Choice C) Myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera (PV), can lead to
erythrocytosis. Patients with PV typically have leukocytosis and thrombocytosis as well. This
patient's additional physical findings make steroid abuse more likely.

(Choice F) Heavy sweating may cause a transient increase in hematocrit due to loss of
plasma volume but would likely cause other signs of dehydration (eg, tachycardia). This
patient's creatinine at the upper limit of normal is typical for patients with increased total

muscle mass; hypovolemia also will usually cause a more pronounced rise in blood urea

nitrogen.

Educational objective:
Androgenic steroid abuse may lead to erythrocytosis, testicular atrophy, acne, and virilization
in women (eg, clitoromegaly, hirsutism).
