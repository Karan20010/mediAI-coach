menses for 23 months in premenopausal patients with previously regular menses). This
patient has secondary amenorrhea, which usually occurs due to endocrine dysfunction (eg,
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis dysfunction, thyroid disorder), pregnancy, or intrauterine
adhesions (ie, Asherman syndrome).

This patient's distorted body image (feeling overweight despite underweight BMI), restricted
diet, exercise regimen, dry skin, and lanugo (fine hair indicating inadequate caloric intake)
suggest anorexia nervosa, a common cause of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea
(FHA). The pathophysiology of FHA is incompletely understood but is thought to arise due to
diminished adipose tissue stores, which reduce circulating leptin levels. In response, the
hypothalamus decreases the amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH) release, leading to low GnRH levels, decreased pituitary LH and FSH
secretion, low circulating estrogen levels, anovulation, and amenorrhea (Choices C and E).

In addition to anorexia nervosa, FHA can also occur when caloric expenditure is out of
proportion to intake, such as in female athletes (eg, distance runners, dancers) or patients
with chronic illness, particularly those with low adipose stores. FHA is a form of
hypogonadotrophic (low LH and FSH) hypogonadism (low estrogen). Therefore, potential
