(Choice D) Advanced diabetic nephropathy may cause reduced erythropoietin production.

The resulting decrease in production of new red cells may lead to falsely high hemoglobin A1c
(similar to nutrient deficiencies).

(Choice E) Chronically elevated blood glucose (ie, poor glycemic control) is the primary cause
of increased hemoglobin A1c in patients with diabetes.

(Choice F) Sickle cell trait is characterized by heterozygous carriage of hemoglobin S. Some
patients with sickle cell trait can have slightly reduced hemoglobin A1c level due to increased

red cell turnover (homozygous individuals with sickle cell disease have rapid red cell turnover

and very low A1c). However, hemoglobin A2 percentage remains near normal in patients with
sickle cell mutations.

Educational objective:

Hemoglobin A1c is produced by nonenzymatic glycosylation of the hemoglobin molecule. A
hemoglobin A1c assay provides an estimate of chronic glycemic control over the life span of
circulating erythrocytes (~3 months). However, rapid erythrocyte turnover (eg, hemolytic
anemia) can give a misleadingly low hemoglobin A1c in relation to glycemic status.
