Craniopharyngiomas are tumors arising from remnants of Rathke's pouch. The anterior
pituitary is formed from an out-pouching of the pharyngeal roof and is called Rathke's pouch.
The posterior pituitary gland arises from an extension of the hypothalamic neurons. Together,
the anterior and posterior pituitary glands lie in the sella turcica at the skull base.

During the time of pituitary development, remnants of Rathke's pouch cells can remain in the
diencephalon (the posterior region of the forebrain). Neoplastic transformation of these "pouch
cells" is called a craniopharyngioma. Typically, craniopharyngiomas have three components:
solid, comprised of the actual tumor cells; cystic, filled with "machinery oil" liquid; and a
calcified component. Any suprasellar mass with three components is highly suggestive of
craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngioma symptoms include headaches, visual field defects,
and hypopituitarism, evidenced by the growth retardation of this child. Ultimately, compression
of the pituitary stalk by craniopharyngioma leads to hyperprolactinemia by loss of
dopaminergic inhibition. Craniopharyngiomas are usually tumors of childhood, being most
frequently discovered between the ages of 5 and 10 years of age.

(Choice A) Prolactinomas are uncommon in young children. They typically appear as a

homogenous mass when imaged. ctivate V
