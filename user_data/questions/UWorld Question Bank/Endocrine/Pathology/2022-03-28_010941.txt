pituitary. In patients with abnormal pituitary or ectopic ACTH production, dexamethasone
affects ACTH levels as described above. However, dexamethasone does not stimulate ACTH
release in any setting.

(Choice D) The fall in cortisol seen in dexamethasone suppression tests is due to feedback
suppression causing decreased ACTH release. A fall in cortisol would not be seen without a
corresponding fall in ACTH.

Educational objective:

Cushing syndrome caused by a pituitary adenoma or ectopic (paraneoplastic) ACTH secretion
is associated with elevated ACTH levels. High-dose dexamethasone suppresses ACTH and
cortisol secretion when Cushing syndrome is caused by a pituitary adenoma (Cushing
disease) but not when it is caused by ectopic ACTH secretion (eg, small cell lung cancer).
