This patient has acne, testicular atrophy, and erythrocytosis, findings concerning for
androgenic steroid abuse. Abuse of androgens, androgen precursors, and agents that
increase endogenous androgen production is most common in young adults who engage in
competitive athletic activities or for cosmetic purposes.

Chronic androgen use may increase muscle mass but has multiple associated risks.
Testosterone stimulates red blood cell production, which accounts for the higher hematocrit in
normal males compared to normal females. This effect is exaggerated in exogenous
androgen abuse, which increases hematocrit in a dose-dependent manner. Androgens
decrease gonadotropin secretion, which results in testicular atrophy and decreased sperm
production. Other common findings include virilization in women (eg, clitoromegaly,
hirsutism) and acne.

(Choices A and D) Mutations that cause a high oxygen affinity of hemoglobin reduce the
ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen in tissues. Low tissue oxygen levels in the kidneys
stimulate erythropoietin release. Renal artery stenosis decreases oxygen delivery to the
kidney and also stimulates erythropoietin release. These conditions may produce a
compensatory erythrocytosis but would not produce the other clinical signs (eg, acne,
testicular atrophy) seen in this patient.
