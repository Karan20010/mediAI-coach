This patient has common features of acromegaly, including coarsening of facial features (eg,
brow protrusion, prognathism), broadening of the hands, and skin involvement (eg, skin tags,
hyperhidrosis). Acromegaly is caused by excessive production of growth hormone (GH) and
is most often due to a pituitary somatotroph adenoma. Excess GH both directly and
indirectly (via release of insulin-like growth factor-1 from the liver) leads to overgrowth of many
tissues, including bone, cartilage, and visceral organs.

Acromegaly can affect the joints in both the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Excessive
GH causes hyperplasia of articular chondrocytes and synovial hypertrophy, which may
appear on x-ray as widening of the joint space. As acromegalic arthropathy continues, there is
degeneration of articular cartilage and periarticular bone resembling osteoarthritis.

Complications of the pituitary mass itself include headache, visual field defects (compression
of optic chiasm), and abnormalities of other pituitary hormones. Hypogonadism can occur
secondary to hyperprolactinemia (from disrupted negative regulation of prolactin secretion) or
directly due to compression of pituitary gonadotrophs.

(Choice A) Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) can cause arthritis due to accumulation of iron
in the articular cartilage and synovium. Although HH can also cause central hypogonadism,
this patient's skeletal and facial features are more consistent with acromegaly.
