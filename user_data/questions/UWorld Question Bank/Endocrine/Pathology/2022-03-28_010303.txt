(Choices A, C, D & E) These are features of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes occurs
when an autoimmune response is triggered by an environmental insult in genetically
susceptible individuals. Patients with type 2 diabetes retain at least some beta cell function,
but patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop absolute deficiency of insulin secondary to
immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. These patients need insulin for survival.
Discontinuation of insulin treatment results in ketoacidosis.

Educational objective:

Pancreatic islet amyloid deposition is characteristic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A strong
linkage with HLA class II gene makeup, pancreatic islet infiltration with leukocytes (insulitis),
and antibodies against islet antigens are frequently seen in type 1 diabetes.
