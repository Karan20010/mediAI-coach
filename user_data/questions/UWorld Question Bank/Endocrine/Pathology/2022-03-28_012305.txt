(Choice C) Carotid dissection typically presents with unilateral headache, transient vision
loss, ptosis, and miosis (partial Horner syndrome). It usually occurs following trauma or can
occur spontaneously in patients with chronic hypertension, connective tissue disease, or
history of smoking.

(Choice D) Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to rupture of a saccular aneurysm near the
optic chiasm can present similarly to pituitary apoplexy. However, SAH is usually associated
with hypertension due to sympathetic activation, and it is unusual for an aneurysm to cause
both bilateral visual field defects (compression of the optic chiasm) and ophthalmoplegia
(compression of the CN III or trochlear nerve [CN IV]). This patient's chronic history of
decreased libido followed by acute cardiovascular collapse is more suggestive of a pituitary

etiology.

(Choice E) Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most common in patients with underlying
thrombophilia, pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, malignancy, or infection. Presenting
features include progressively worse headaches, vomiting, seizures, and oculomotor deficits
(similar to pituitary mass compression). However, chronically decreased libido, bitemporal
hemianopsia, and sudden death from hypotension would be unusual.
