retinal vasculature), and eruptive xanthomas (small yellowish papules surrounded by erythema
found mainly on extensor surfaces).

(Choice B) The familial hyperlipoproteinemias are not associated with intellectual disability.

(Choices C, D, and E) Accelerated coronary artery disease, tendon xanthomas (nodular lipid
deposits in the tendons, particularly the Achilles), and xanthelasmas are seen in familial
hypercholesterolemia, a condition caused by defects in the LDL receptor or its ligand, ApoB-
100. As LDL is mainly cleared from the circulation by receptor-mediated uptake in the liver,
individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia have dramatically elevated LDL concentrations.

Educational objective:

Familial chylomicronemia syndrome frequently presents in childhood with recurrent episodes
of acute pancreatitis. Patients with this disorder are not usually at increased risk for premature
coronary artery disease. Eruptive skin xanthomas may be present in hypertriglyceridemia, but
tendon xanthomas and xanthelasmas are primarily seen with hypercholesterolemia.
