(Choice A) Riedel thyroiditis is a rare disorder characterized by extensive fibrosis of the
thyroid that extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and fixed.
Hypothyroidism is common but is not typically preceded by a hyperthyroid phase.

(Choices B and E) Granulomatous inflammation in the pituitary can occur as a primary
phenomenon or secondary to systemic granulomatous disorders (eg, sarcoidosis,
tuberculosis). Lymphocytic hypophysitis is an uncommon disorder that also occurs with
increased frequency in postpartum women. Both of these disorders can cause
secondary/central hypothyroidism due to loss of pituitary thyrotrophs, which leads to low (not
elevated) TSH.

(Choice C) Like postpartum thyroiditis, subacute (postviral, granulomatous, De Quervain)
thyroiditis also follows a phasic course with initial hyperthyroidism due to release of preformed
hormone followed by a hypothyroid phase. However, the thyroid is painful and tender, and
fever is common because it is believed to be a postviral inflammatory process.

Educational objective:

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles. It begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to release
of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to depletion of
