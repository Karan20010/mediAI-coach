Question Id: 225

This patient had typical features of acute pituitary hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy), including
a severe headache, bitemporal hemianopsia (due to compression of the optic chiasm), and
ophthalmoplegia (due to compression of the oculomotor nerve [CN Ill]). Pituitary apoplexy
usually occurs in a preexisting pituitary adenoma, as in this patient with chronic headaches
and low libido (likely due to hyperprolactinemia). The diagnosis can be confirmed on cross-

sectional imaging (MRI scan).

Pituitary apoplexy typically causes loss of all pituitary function; acute loss of ACTH secretion
can lead to adrenal crisis (acute central adrenal insufficiency). Cortisol helps maintain
vascular tone by potentiating the vasoconstrictive effects of catecholamines (eg,
norepinephrine); in the absence of ACTH, the adrenal cortex ceases production of cortisol,
leading to severe hypotension and distributive shock. Pituitary apoplexy is a medical
emergency that requires urgent treatment with glucocorticoids and neurosurgical

consultation.

(Choice B) Hemorrhage into the putamen (basal ganglia) causes neurologic deficits that
gradually worsen over minutes to hours. Typical features include contralateral hemiparesis
and hemianesthesia due to disruption of the corticospinal and somatosensory tracts. It is most
often seen in chronic hypertensive vasculopathy.
