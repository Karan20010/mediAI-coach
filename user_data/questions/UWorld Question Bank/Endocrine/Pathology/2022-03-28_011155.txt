affect excess adrenal androgen production in CAH.

(Choice D) Hyperprolactinemia disrupts GnRH secretion, which leads to decreased
testosterone production and hypogonadism. Prolactin suppression would further elevate
testosterone levels and would not be beneficial in this patient.

(Choice E) This patient's symptoms are the result of excessive production of adrenal
androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione), which can subsequently
undergo peripheral conversion to testosterone. Blockade of testosterone alone would not be
sufficient to prevent progression of this patient's symptoms, as the androgenic effects of these
testosterone precursors would remain unopposed.

Educational objective:

Treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency involves low
doses of exogenous corticosteroids to suppress excess ACTH secretion, which reduces
production of androgens by the adrenal cortex.
