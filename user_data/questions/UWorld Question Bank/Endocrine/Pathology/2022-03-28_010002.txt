(Choice A) Papillary thyroid cancer is characterized by branching papillary structures with
concentric calcifications (psammoma bodies). This malignancy would typically present with
nodular enlargement rather than acute pain and tenderness.

(Choice B) Riedel thyroiditis is characterized by extensive fibrosis of the thyroid gland that
extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and nontender.

(Choice C) Diffusely hyperplastic follicles with tall, crowded cells forming intrafollicular
projections can be seen in Graves disease, which would show increased radioiodine uptake
due to excessive TSH receptor stimulation.

(Choice E) Chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is characterized by diffuse, painless
thyroid enlargement, often with symptoms of hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, cold intolerance).
Biopsy reveals diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with formation of germinal centers.

Educational objective:

Subacute granulomatous (de Quervain) thyroiditis is characterized by painful thyroid
enlargement and usually follows a viral illness. Biopsy shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate
with macrophages and multinucleated giant cells.
