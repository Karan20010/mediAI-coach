The 4 main types of primary thyroid carcinoma include papillary, follicular, medullary (derived
from the parafollicular, calcitonin-secreting C cells), and anaplastic. The papillary type is
most common, accounting for >70% of cases. Risk factors include a positive family history of
thyroid cancer and radiation exposure, especially in childhood.

Papillary carcinoma cells are characteristically large with overlapping nuclei containing finely
dispersed chromatin, giving them an empty or ground-glass appearance (sometimes termed
Orphan Annie eye nuclei after a cartoon character whose eyes were drawn without pupils or
irises). Numerous nuclear grooves as well as intranuclear inclusions composed of
cytoplasm (ie, pseudoinclusions) can be seen due to invagination of the nuclear membrane.
Psammoma bodies (laminated calcium deposits) may also be found within the tumor.

(Choice A) Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is an aggressive tumor with a very poor prognosis.

It is most common in patients age >60. Cytologic features include markedly pleomorphic cells,
including irregular giant and spindle cells.

(Choice B) Most benign thyroid nodules are colloid nodules formed from focal hyperplasia of

normal thyroid follicular cells. On cytopathology, a colloid nodule consists of variable-sized
thyroid follicles, colloid, and macrophages.
