stereocilia due to shearing forces against the tectorial membrane. High-frequency hearing is
lost first, regardless of the frequency of the sound causing the damage.

(Choice A) Hearing loss originating in the auditory nerve is most commonly due to a
vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma). Patients develop high-frequency sensorineural
hearing loss, but symptoms are usually unilateral.

(Choice B) The cochlear cupula is the apex of the cochlea and is distant from the oval
window. The distal cochlea primarily registers low-frequency sound.

(Choice C) Defects of the middle ear ossicles (eg, otosclerosis) can cause hearing loss that
generally affects air conduction across all frequencies. This patient's hearing loss affects both
air and bone conduction.

(Choice E) The round window lies between the middle and inner ear and moves outward
when the stapes causes the oval window to move inward. Malformation of the round window
can cause congenital hearing impairment, but acquired disorders are rare.

(Choice F) Perforation or rupture of the tympanic membrane can occur with infection, trauma,
pressure changes, or sudden and very loud noises. Rupture of the tympanic membrane
causes unilateral conductive hearing loss.
