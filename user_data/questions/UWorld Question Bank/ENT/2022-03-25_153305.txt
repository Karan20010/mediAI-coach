upper pharynx and base of tongue, also provides sensory innervation to the external auditory
canal and can contribute to referred otalgia from tumors in these areas.

(Choices A, B, and F) The trigeminal nerve (CN V) provides sensory innervation for much of
the face, including parts of the ear. The facial nerve (CN VII) and great auricular nerve
(originates from C2 and C3) innervate portions of the external auditory canal. Although these
nerves carry sensation from the ear, they do not provide innervation to the hypopharynx.

(Choice C) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) contributes special sensory (hearing,
balance) from the ear but does not contribute to general sensation. Therefore, lesions that
impact the vestibulocochlear nerve tend to cause hearing loss or imbalance (eg, vertigo) rather
than pain.

(Choice E) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) innervates the muscles of the tongue. It has
motor function only, so dysfunction tends to produce weakness (eg, deviation of the tongue)
rather than pain.

Educational objective:

Referred otalgia is common in head and neck pathology because many cranial nerves
innervate the ear (eg, CN V, VII, IX, X). In particular, tumors in the hypopharynx, larynx, or
