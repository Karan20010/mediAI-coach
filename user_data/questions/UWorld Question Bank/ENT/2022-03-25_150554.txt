(Choice A) The spinal accessory nerve (CN XI) exits the jugular foramen and courses on top
of the levator scapulae muscle to innervate the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles on
either side.

(Choice B) The ansa cervicalis is a loop of the cervical plexus that receives contributions from
C1-C3. It courses deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle and loops around the internal
jugular vein. Branches from the ansa cervicalis innervate the sternohyoid, sternothyroid, and
omohyoid muscles.

(Choice C) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) exits the cranium through the hypoglossal canal
and innervates all the muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus.

(Choice D) The phrenic nerve arises from the C3-C5 cervical nerves and innervates the
diaphragm. The most common cause of iatrogenic phrenic nerve injury is cardiothoracic
surgery, in which the nerve can be damaged where it passes between the pericardium and
mediastinal pleura. Manifestations include diaphragmatic paralysis (inspiratory weakness).

(Choice F) The superior cervical ganglion is part of the sympathetic nervous system. It can
be injured by an expanding lung cancer at the superior pulmonary sulcus (Pancoast tumor),
leading to Horner syndrome (ie, ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis).
