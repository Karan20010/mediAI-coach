(Choice A) The lateral pterygoid muscles depress the mandible (ie, open the jaw). They are
not impacted in cleft lip or palate.

(Choice C) The orbicularis oris encircles the mouth, acting as a sphincter to close the mouth
and pucker the lips. In cleft lip, it does not form a complete circle, but inserts into the base of
the nose on either side of the cleft; however, it does not impact the function of the eustachian
tube.

(Choice D) The stapedius muscle is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII). It arises from the
wall of the tympanic cavity and inserts on the neck of the stapes bone. It functions to stabilize
the stapes. Contraction causes dampening of sound transmission in response to loud noises.
It does not open the eustachian tube.

(Choice E) The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral
oropharyngeal walls. Contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus during
swallowing. Together with the levator veli palatini, it elevates the palate to seal the nasal cavity
during swallowing. Although both functions are impaired in cleft palate, the superior
pharyngeal constrictor does not play a direct role in opening the eustachian tube.
