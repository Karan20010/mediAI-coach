Cholesteatomas are collections of squamous cell debris that form a round, pearly mass
behind the tympanic membrane in the middle ear. They can occur congenitally or may
develop in adults as either an acquired primary lesion or secondary to infection, trauma, or
surgery of the middle ear. Primary cholesteatomas are a result of chronic negative pressure in
the middle ear causing retraction pockets in the tympanic membrane that become cystic; as
the squamous cell debris accumulates, a cholesteatoma is formed. Secondary
cholesteatomas occur after squamous epithelium migrates to or is implanted in the middle ear
("skin in the wrong place").

Cholesteatomas most commonly cause painless otorrhea. They also can produce lytic
enzymes and are often discovered when they erode through the auditory ossicles, causing
conductive hearing loss. If a mass grows sufficiently large, it can erode into the vestibular
apparatus or facial nerve, causing vertigo or facial palsies.
