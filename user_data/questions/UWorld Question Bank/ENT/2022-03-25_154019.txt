Most carcinomas, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, spread first from the
primary site of the tumor to regional lymph nodes via the lymphatics. In this patient with a
tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma, this spread would be to the upper anterior cervical (ie,
jugular) lymph nodes. Assessment of regional lymph node status is important for tumor
staging based on the TNM staging system, which evaluates the size and characteristics of

the Tumor, regional lymph Node involvement, and distant Metastases.
