This patient has nasal congestion, sneezing, and rhinorrhea accompanied by conjunctivitis.
This is consistent with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, a type 1 hypersensitivity that triggers an
allergic response via the binding of a previously recognized antigen to IgE antibodies on mast
cells.

Because exposure to allergens results in a rapid allergic response and avoidance of allergens
improves symptoms, patients can often distinguish patterns to their reactions. Typical patterns
include the following:

¢ Seasonal variation: The variation is often related to specific pollinators at particular times
of the year.

¢ Geographical variation: Symptoms improve when patients are not exposed to the typical
allergens of the region (eg, going on vacation).

¢ Animal exposure: Symptoms occur when visiting a house with pets or begin shortly after
animal acquisition.

¢ Indoor versus outdoor: Patients with predominantly indoor symptoms may have an
allergy to dust mites; outdoor symptoms suggest pollinators.
