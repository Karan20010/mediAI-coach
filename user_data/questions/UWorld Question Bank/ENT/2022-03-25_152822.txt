(Choice A) Autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for some forms of syndromic
cleft lip and palate, which can lead to index cases with no family history. However, most cases
are caused by multifactorial inheritance, particularly in the absence of other findings consistent

with a genetic syndrome.

(Choice B) An embryologic disruption refers to an interruption of normal organ development
due to an outside influence. For instance, amniotic bands can cause constriction rings or
extremity amputations. In contrast, cleft lip and palate are caused by embryologic fusion
failure much earlier in fetal development.

(Choice C) Conditions with mitochondrial inheritance are transmitted only by affected females
to all of their offspring; therefore, a father would have no family history of the condition.
Examples include mitochondrial myopathies, myoclonic epilepsy, and Leber hereditary optic
neuropathy.

(Choice E) In genetically normal (46, XX) female patients, a single X chromosome is normally
randomly deactivated in each cell during early embryonic development. In rare cases, uneven
inactivation of maternal/paternal X chromosomes (ie, skewed X-inactivation) may result in
female offspring developing an X-linked recessive condition. In these conditions, an affected
father with a female offspring would be expected.
