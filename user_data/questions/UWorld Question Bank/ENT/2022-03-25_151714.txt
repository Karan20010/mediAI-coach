Cholesteatomas are collections of squamous cell debris that form a mass behind the tympanic
membrane. Cholesteatomas can be congenital or may occur as an acquired primary lesion or
following infection, trauma, or surgery of the middle ear. They can cause hearing loss due to
erosion into auditory ossicles.
