A 33-year-old man comes to the office due to trouble swallowing and a chronic sore throat. He
has no chronic medical conditions and does not use tobacco or alcohol. Physical examination
shows an enlarged, ulcerated right tonsil. Biopsy of the ulcerated lesion reveals infiltrating
nests of moderately differentiated squamous cells. Immunohistochemistry is positive for p16,
suggesting that the tumor is likely due to human papilloma virus. Further imaging studies for
cancer staging are planned. This patient's tumor is most likely to spread first to which of the
following locations?

(©) A. Adenoid tissue

© B. Adrenal glands

(©) C. Gray-white matter junction
