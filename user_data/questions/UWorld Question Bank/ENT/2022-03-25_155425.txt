experiences excessive withdrawal symptoms, a short-term course of topical corticosteroids
can be considered for symptom control. However, oral corticosteroids would not be indicated.

(Choice D) Antihistamines are used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, but they are not

(Choice E) Antibiotics are effective in the treatment of certain bacterial infections. They are
not used in the treatment of rebound rhinorrhea.

Educational objective:

Topical preparations of a-adrenergic agonists cause vasoconstriction of the nasal mucosa
vessels and are used as decongestants. Overuse of these drugs causes negative feedback,
resulting in decreased norepinephrine synthesis and release from nerve endings, which
diminishes their effect (ie, tachyphylaxis).
