Squamous cell carcinoma that originates in the mucosa of the head and neck typically
spreads first to the anterior cervical lymph nodes. An enlarged, firm cervical lymph node is
often the presenting symptom of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Identification of the primary site of tumor formation is important for staging and to guide
treatment strategies.

This patient's unilateral middle ear effusion suggests obstruction of the eustachian tube,
which connects the middle ear space to the nasopharynx. It opens intermittently, typically
during swallowing or yawning to equalize pressure in the middle ear. Failure to adequately
open causes negative pressure to build within the middle ear, leading to a transudative
effusion (clear, amber, or yellow). Eustachian tube dysfunction can be due to anatomic
obstruction from a mass in the nasopharynx or, more commonly, due to functional
obstruction from infections, allergic rhinitis, or irritants (eg, tobacco smoke).
