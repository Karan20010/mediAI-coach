This patient with a history of tobacco and alcohol use has persistent leukoplakia (white
mucosal lesion) on the buccal and gingival mucosa. Biopsy shows full-thickness dysplasia
characterized by abnormal cytology (eg, squamous cells with pleomorphic and hyperchromatic
nuclei, dyskeratosis) and architecture (eg, loss of normal squamous maturation). These
findings are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma in situ.

Most cancers of the head and neck arise from squamous epithelial cells that undergo
stepwise, premalignant changes that progress to carcinoma (ie, hyperplasia — dysplasia >
carcinoma in situ — invasive carcinoma). Premalignant lesions may initially manifest in the
oral cavity as hyperplastic or dysplastic, white (leukoplakia) or red (erythroplakia) patches.
The likelihood of progression to invasive cancer (which has a propensity to spread first to
the cervical lymph nodes) depends on the degree of dysplasia, with severe dysplasia having
a high likelihood of developing into invasive carcinoma. For this reason, oral leukoplakic
lesions with severe dysplasia are typically surgically removed.
