Blunt trauma to the eye causes a rapid increase in pressure that typically does not rupture the
globe but is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit. The weakest plates of bone in the orbit, the
medial and inferior walls, are common sites of fracture. Fracture is typically evident on
radiographic imaging, and fluid (eg, blood) or herniation of the orbital contents can often be
visualized in the adjacent normally air-filled sinuses.

(Choice A) The ethmoid air cells are medial to the orbit. They are unaffected in this patient,
but they can be affected in blowout fractures of the orbit's medial wall.

(Choice B) The frontal sinus is not pictured above. It lies in the medial part of the supraorbital
frontal bone.

(Choice C) The inferior nasal conchae form part of the nasal turbinate system. They are not
air-filled sinuses.

(Choice E) The sphenoid sinuses (not pictured above) lie anterior to the optic chiasm and are
not in close relation to the orbit.

Educational objective:

Blunt trauma to the globe can cause orbital blowout fractures. These fractures most
