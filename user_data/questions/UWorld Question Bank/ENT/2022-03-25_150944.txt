This patient has a small mandible, posteriorly displaced tongue, and U-shaped cleft palate,
which is consistent with Pierre Robin sequence. A sequence occurs when a single
developmental defect causes a cascade of additional malformations.

In Pierre Robin sequence, hypoplasia of the mandibular prominence leads to micrognathia.
Severe micrognathia causes posterior displacement of the tongue (glossoptosis), which
blocks fusion of the palatine shelves, resulting in a cleft palate that is characteristically U-
shaped. Difficulty breathing occurs because the tongue prolapses into the posterior
oropharynx, blocking airflow. Breathing improves when the patient is in a prone position
because gravity pulls the tongue anteriorly, opening the airway.
