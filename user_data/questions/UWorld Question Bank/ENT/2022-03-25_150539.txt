The inferior thyroid artery arises from the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian
artery. Along with the superior thyroid arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries), the
inferior thyroid arteries provide blood to the thyroid gland and other structures of the anterior
neck. From the thyrocervical trunk, the inferior thyroid artery courses deep to the internal
jugular vein, vagus nerve, and common carotid artery before turning toward the thyroid. As it
approaches the thyroid, the artery comes in close proximity to the recurrent laryngeal
nerve.

The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve that loops below the aortic arch
on the left and below the subclavian artery on the right to provide motor innervation to the
intrinsic muscles of the larynx (except the cricothyroid). During thyroid surgery, this nerve
may be damaged due to its proximity to the inferior thyroid artery. Unilateral nerve injury often
causes hoarseness, whereas bilateral injury may cause inspiratory stridor and respiratory
distress due to complete vocal cord paralysis.
