Educational objective:

Nystatin is a polyene antifungal and the drug of choice for oropharyngeal candidiasis in
patients without advanced immunodeficiency. It acts by binding to ergosterol in the fungal cell
membrane, causing the formation of pores and leakage of fungal cell contents. Nystatin is not
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and is administered as an oral "swish and swallow"

agent.
