reduction is usually necessary.

(Choice A) The buccinator muscle underlies the cheek. It holds the cheek close to the teeth
to control food boluses during chewing but is not involved in movement of the jaw.

(Choice B) The genioglossus muscles form the body of the tongue. Although they originate
on the tubercle of the mandible (and insert into the hyoid bone and the bottom of the tongue),
they are responsible for tongue protrusion rather than mandibular movement.

(Choice D) The sternocleidomastoid muscles originate at the sternum and the clavicle and
insert on the mastoid tip. They rotate the head (when acting independently) or flex the neck
(when acting in concert).

(Choice E) The superior pharyngeal constrictor forms portions of the posterior and lateral
oropharyngeal walls. Muscle contraction propels food and liquid inferiorly into the esophagus
during swallowing.

(Choice F) The zygomaticus major originates from the zygomatic bone and inserts onto the
angle of the mouth. Contraction pulls the angle of the mouth laterally and superiorly during a

smile.
