This patient has otalgia in the setting of a normal ear examination, which is likely referred
pain (pain perceived at a different site than its true origin). Further evaluation shows an
ulcerative mass in the hypopharynx with an enlarged lymph node, which is consistent with
mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Many sources of pain in the head and neck can be referred to the ear because several cranial
nerves also innervate parts of the ear. Common causes of referred ear pain include
temporomandibular joint disease, dental disease, or cancer affecting the tongue base,
hypopharynx, or larynx.

This patient's referred otalgia is most likely due to his hypopharyngeal carcinoma causing
irritation of the vagus nerve (CN X). The vagus nerve has afferent fibers innervating the
larynx and hypopharynx and also has a branch that provides afferent sensory input from the
external auditory canal. Similarly, the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), which innervates the
upper pharynx and base of tongue, also provides sensory innervation to the external auditory
canal and can contribute to referred otalgia from tumors in these areas.
