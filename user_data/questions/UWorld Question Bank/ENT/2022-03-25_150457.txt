A 44-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of a neck lump. The patient first noticed
the lump 6 months ago while he was shaving and says that it seems to be growing in size. He
has no pain, shortness of breath, cough, hoarseness, or difficulty swallowing. The patient had
Hodgkin lymphoma 20 years ago, which was successfully treated with radiation therapy to his
chest and neck. Physical examination shows a firm mass in the left thyroid lobe. There is no
lymphadenopathy. Serum TSH level is normal. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy reveals
papillary thyroid cancer. A total thyroidectomy is performed. During an attempt to ligate the
inferior thyroid artery, a nervous structure in close proximity is inadvertently damaged. Which
of the following was most likely injured during the surgery?
