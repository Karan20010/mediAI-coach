Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a nonlactose-fermenting, oxidase-positive, motile, Gram-negative
rod. It is the most common cause of malignant otitis externa (MOE), a serious infection of the
ear seen in elderly diabetic patients. MOE presents with exquisite ear pain and drainage, and

granulation tissue is often seen within the ear canal.
