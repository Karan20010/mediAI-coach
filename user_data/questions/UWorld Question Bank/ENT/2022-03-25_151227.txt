This patient's head imaging reveals a ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding edema,
findings concerning for a brain abscess. Presentation of a brain abscess is often nonspecific
and can include headache with or without fever or focal neurologic deficits. Seizure may also
be the initial manifestation in some patients, as seen in this girl.

A brain abscess can be due to the hematogenous spread of bacteria from a distant location
(eg, pulmonary infection with bacteremia) or the direct extension of a head and neck space
infection, such as otitis media, sinusitis, or mastoiditis.

Because of its anatomic proximity to the middle ear, a temporal lobe abscess, as seen in this
patient, can develop as a rare complication of acute otitis media; a recent history of fever, ear
pain, and bulging tympanic membrane in this patient would support this diagnosis.
Microbiologic examination of the abscess generally reflects the primary site of infection, such
as Streptococcus pneumoniae from middle ear infections.
