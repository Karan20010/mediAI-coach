This patient has an anterior dislocation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the synovial
joint that opens and closes the jaw. The joint is formed by the mandibular condyle that sits in
the glenoid fossa of the squamous portion of the temporal bone.

TMJ opening involves a complex movement that has both hinge and sliding components:

¢ The initial movement is rotational (ie, hinge) and driven by the lateral pterygoid muscles,
which are the only muscles of mastication that aid in depressing the mandible (ie,
opening the jaw).

¢ As the jaw opens, the ligaments become taut, stopping further rotation.

¢ Further action by the lateral pterygoids results in translational movement (ie, condyle
slides anteriorly) that opens the jaw fully.

TMJ dislocation occurs when translational movement is exaggerated due to extreme jaw
opening (eg, yawning, orotracheal intubation, seizure) that causes displacement of the
condyle anteriorly out of the glenoid fossa. Stretching of the ligaments causes significant pain
and spasm of the muscles of mastication. This muscle spasm (specifically of the lateral
pterygoids that aid jaw opening) prevents spontaneous resolution of the dislocation; manual
reduction is usually necessary.
