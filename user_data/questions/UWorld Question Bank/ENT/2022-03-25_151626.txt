examination, panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract).

(Choice A) Chemotherapy can induce secondary malignancies, most commonly leukemia
and lymphoma, in cancer survivors. In contrast to the tumors in this patient, secondary
malignancies are seen years or even decades later.

(Choices C and F) Most carcinomas, including HNSCC, spread via the lymphatic system,
leading to metastases in the regional (eg, ipsilateral anterior neck) lymph nodes. However, it is
unlikely for the carcinoma to spread back up to a contralateral epithelial site. Hematogenous
spread is less common with carcinomas and typically results in metastases to distant sites.

(Choice D) Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) display inherent immune privilege, in
which foreign grafts or cancers that would otherwise induce immunologic rejection are
tolerated. Cancers may establish local sites of immune privilege to evade destruction, but this
does not cause new tumor formation.

(Choice E) Cancer treatment (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy) can result in impaired
wound healing, which can result in acutely ulcerative oral lesions due to mucositis. However,
these lesions would not be malignant.
