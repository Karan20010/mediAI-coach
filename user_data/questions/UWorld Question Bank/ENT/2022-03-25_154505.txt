(Choice A) Failure of the medial nasal prominence to fuse and form the intermaxillary
segment is associated with severe midline defects, such as holoprosencephaly.

(Choice C) During the seventh-eighth week of embryonic development, the maxillary
prominences give rise to palatine shelves. The thin sheets of tissue that comprise the palatine
shelves grow medially and fuse into the secondary palate. Fusion of the secondary palate
with the posterior aspect of the primary palate forms the complete palate. Failure of any of
these processes can lead to cleft palate. The presence of a cleft lip increases the risk of cleft
palate, but either can occur in isolation.

(Choice D) The orbits normally arise from the sides of the face and rotate medially. However,
excessive tissue from the frontal nasal prominence could result in orbital hypertelorism (wide-
set eyes) in addition to a broad forehead and wide nasal bridge.

(Choice E) Micrognathia is characterized by hypoplasia of the mandibular prominence. In
Pierre-Robin sequence, the severe micrognathia results in posterior displacement of the
tongue (glossoptosis) and prevents fusion of the secondary palate (cleft palate).

Educational objective:
Cleft lip results when the maxillary prominence fails to fuse with the intermaxillary segment Activate V
