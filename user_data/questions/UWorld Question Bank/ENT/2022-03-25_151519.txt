Educational objective:

Acute otitis media usually occurs after a viral upper respiratory infection causes obstruction of
the eustachian tube. This obstruction leads to the accumulation of secretions, which
encourages bacterial growth. The most common bacterial causes are respiratory colonizers,
including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis.
