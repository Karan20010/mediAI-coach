This patient is experiencing acute, life-threatening laryngeal edema as part of an anaphylactic
reaction precipitated by exposure to an allergen. Laryngeal edema can initially present with
throat tightness, difficulty swallowing, dyspnea, and hoarseness. However, the condition can
quickly progress to compromise the airway and cause asphyxiation.

Cricothyrotomy is indicated when an emergency airway is required and orotracheal or
nasotracheal intubation is either unsuccessful or contraindicated (eg, massive hemorrhage,
vomiting, facial trauma, airway obstruction). The procedure establishes an airway through the
placement of a tube between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages and requires incision through
the following structures:

1. Skin
2. Superficial cervical fascia (including subcutaneous fat and platysma muscle)

3. Investing and pretracheal layers of the deep cervical fascia
4. Cricothyroid membrane
