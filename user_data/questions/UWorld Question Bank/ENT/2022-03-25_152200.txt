The orbit is bound superiorly by the thick orbital plate of the frontal bone and laterally by the
thick bone of the zygoma and greater and lesser sphenoid wings. In contrast, the orbital floor
is composed of a very thin layer of bone that separates the orbit from the air-filled maxillary
sinus. Similarly, the orbit's medial wall is composed of the thin ethmoid and lacrimal bones,
which separate it from the ethmoid air cells.

Blunt trauma to the eye causes a rapid increase in pressure that typically does not rupture the
globe but is transmitted posteriorly into the orbit. The weakest plates of bone in the orbit, the
medial and inferior walls, are common sites of fracture. Fracture is typically evident on
radiographic imaging, and fluid (eg, blood) or herniation of the orbital contents can often be
visualized in the adjacent normally air-filled sinuses.
