The majority of the external ear receives cutaneous innervation from the great auricular nerve,
lesser occipital nerve, and auriculotemporal nerve. Most of the external auditory canal,
including the external portion of the tympanic membrane, is innervated by the mandibular
division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve [CN] V3) via its auriculotemporal branch.

However, the posterior part of the external auditory canal, as well as the concavity and
posterior eminentia of the concha, is innervated by the small auricular branch of the vagus
nerve (CN X). This patient has experienced vasovagal syncope after stimulation of his
posterior external auditory canal by an otoscope speculum. In this form of syncope,
parasympathetic outflow via the vagus nerve leads to decreased heart rate and blood
pressure.
