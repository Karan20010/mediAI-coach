(Choice A) The buccopharyngeal fascia invests the pharyngeal constrictor muscles and lies
anterior to the alar fascia, forming the retropharyngeal space between them. The danger
space lies posterior to the retropharyngeal space (between the alar and prevertebral fascia).
Retropharyngeal abscesses can drain directly into the superior mediastinum or penetrate into
the danger space to extend along the entire length of the mediastinum, causing acute
necrotizing mediastinitis.

(Choices B and C) The cricoid cartilage lies inferior to the thyroid cartilage at the level of the
C6 vertebra, and the thyroid isthmus lies inferior to the cricoid cartilage. Incisions made during
cricothyrotomy should be performed with care to prevent damage to these structures.

(Choice D) The deep cervical fascia is composed of three layers: investing, pretracheal, and
prevertebral. The prevertebral layer of the deep fascia surrounds the vertebral column and
spinal muscles; it is not penetrated during cricothyrotomy.

Educational objective:

Cricothyrotomy is indicated when an emergency airway is required and orotracheal or

nasotracheal intubation is either unsuccessful or contraindicated. The cricothyrotomy incision

passes through the superficial cervical fascia, pretracheal fascia, and the cricothyroid

membrane. PCEVENO
