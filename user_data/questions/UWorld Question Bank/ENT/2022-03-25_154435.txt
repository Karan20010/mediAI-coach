The lip and palate form during the fifth-sixth week of embryonic development through a

series of fusions:

1.

1e*)

The first pharyngeal arch splits into the upper maxillary prominence and the lower

mandibular prominence.

. Fusion of the 2 medial nasal prominences forms the midline intermaxillary segment. The

intermaxillary segment will become the philtrum of the upper lip, the 4 medial maxillary

teeth, and the primary palate.

. The left and right maxillary prominences then fuse with the midline intermaxillary segment

to form the upper lip and primary palate. If one of the maxillary prominences fails to fuse
with the intermaxillary segment, a unilateral cleft lip results. If both maxillary prominences

fail to fuse with the intermaxillary segment, bilateral cleft lip results.
