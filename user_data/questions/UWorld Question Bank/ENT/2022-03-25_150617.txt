A 42-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss dizziness. She has a 6-month history of
episodic bouts of a "spinning sensation" associated with nausea and ringing in her left ear.
The patient also has difficulty hearing while holding her phone to the left ear, although hearing
in her right ear is normal. The dizziness improves spontaneously and she feels "fine" between
episodes. Past medical history is notable for hypothyroidism, for which she is on thyroid
replacement therapy, and endometriosis, which led to a hysterectomy at age 38. The patient
works as a supermarket manager. She does not use tobacco or drink alcohol. The patient's
condition is most likely the result of which of the following?

A. Demyelinating process in the central nervous system (6%)
YB. Increased volume of endolymph in the inner ear (54%)

C. Inflammation of the vestibular labyrinth (18%)

D. Mass lesion at the cerebellopontine angle (16%)
