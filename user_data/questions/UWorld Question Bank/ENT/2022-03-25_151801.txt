This patient has chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and failure to thrive, findings
concerning for cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited, multisystem disorder characterized by
the abnormal transport of sodium and chloride due to a mutation in the CFTR gene. Although
common CF mutations (eg, AF508) are often identified on newborn screening, less common
mutations may go undetected and cause milder symptoms later in childhood.

Abnormal CFTR function causes thick, viscous respiratory secretions and impaired mucociliary
clearance, leading to chronic sinopulmonary disease (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis). Patients
typically have chronic cough, nasal congestion, and facial pain, as seen in this patient.
Bilateral nasal polyps, benign outgrowths of inflamed mucosa, are also common due to
chronic infection and present as nontender, shiny, gray masses in the nasal cavity or
paranasal sinuses.

In CF, viscous secretions can also block pancreatic ducts, leading to pancreatic
insufficiency. Decreased or absent pancreatic enzymes cause fat malabsorption with oily,
loose stools and failure to thrive and/or weight loss. Over time, pancreatic injury can also
lead to insufficient insulin production and CF-related diabetes.
