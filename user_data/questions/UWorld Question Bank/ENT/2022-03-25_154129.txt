The Rinne test compares air versus bone conduction (via the mastoid bone). As the vibration
of the tuning fork fades, air-conducted sound is normally louder and heard longer than bone-
conducted sound. The Rinne test is considered positive (normal) if the sound is heard best at
the external auditory meatus (air conduction) and negative (abnormal) if the patient hears the
vibration better at the mastoid (bone conduction).

¢ Bone conduction greater than air conduction suggests conductive hearing loss.

The Weber test is performed by placing a vibrating tuning fork on the middle of forehead
equidistant from both ears. The vibration carried by bone conduction is normally heard equally
in both ears; vibration heard louder in one ear is abnormal.

¢ Conductive hearing loss causes lateralization to the affected ear as the conduction deficit
masks the ambient noise in the room, allowing the vibration to be better heard.

¢ Sensorineural hearing loss causes lateralization to the unaffected ear as the unimpaired
inner ear can better sense the vibration.

The Rinne test is abnormal in this patient's left ear, and the Weber test lateralizes to her left
ear. These findings suggest conductive hearing loss in the left ear.
