(Choice A) Similar to the tonsils, adenoid tissue is also lymphatic tissue in the head and neck
that can harbor a primary site of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. However, it is
located in the nasopharynx rather than the oropharynx. The spread of cancer is typically to
regional lymph nodes rather than to other mucosal sites in the head and neck.

(Choices B, C, and F) Although these are possible sites of distant cancer metastases, they

are less commonly associated with metastatic head and neck cancer. Common primary
sources for metastases to these sites include:

e Adrenal gland metastases: breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and melanoma

¢ Brain metastases (gray-white matter junction): lung cancer

e Vertebral body metastases: prostate cancer
However, the first site of spread of most carcinomas (including head and neck cancer) is the
regional lymph nodes.
(Choice E) The lung parenchyma is the most common site for distant metastases from head
and neck cancer. However, regional lymph node spread is typically seen first.

Educational objective:
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas typically spread first to the anterior cervical (ie,

jugular) lymph nodes via the lymphatics. Distant spread occurs after regional lymph node
