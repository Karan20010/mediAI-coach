This patient with an erythematous tympanic membrane and purulent otorrhea has acute otitis
media (AOM) complicated by tympanic membrane perforation, which can be obscured due to
drainage. Acute middle ear infections occur most commonly in young children (age 6 months
to 2 years) and are often due to Streptococcus pneumoniae.

A viral upper respiratory infection (URI) typically precedes the development of AOM
because it causes inflammatory edema of the respiratory mucosa that can lead to obstruction
of the eustachian tube. The eustachian tube normally opens to equalize middle ear pressure
and drain secretions. Therefore, obstruction leads to the accumulation of secretions,
providing a rich medium for bacterial growth. Bacterial colonizers of the upper respiratory
tract (eg, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis) then proliferate in the
middle ear secretions. This overgrowth of bacteria and consequent immune response result in
AOM.

Suppurative fluid accumulation increases middle ear pressure and causes the tympanic
membrane to become inflamed and bulge outward. If the eustachian tube remains obstructed,
this increased pressure can rupture the tympanic membrane.
