mast cell degranulation (Choices A and C). This releases histamine and other vasoactive
mediators that lead to nasal inflammation, producing the allergic response. Subsequent
exposure to the same antigen can lead to further allergen priming, worsening symptoms over

time.

(Choice B) Complement activation occurs in type III hypersensitivity reactions, in which
immune complexes deposit in the basement membrane of small blood vessels in the skin,
kidneys, or joints, resulting in vasculitis. Complement does not play a significant role in type |
hypersensitivity.

(Choice D) Interferon gamma is secreted by Th1 cells, which activates macrophages and,
along with IL-2, stimulates CD8- cytotoxic cells. It inhibits, rather than enhances, the Th2 cell
activity that drives type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (eg, allergic rhinitis).

Educational objective:

Sensitization to aeroallergens occurs when inhaled antigens induce T-helper (Th) cells to
differentiate into Th2 cells. Th2 cells then promote B-cell maturation and isotype class

switching to IgE.
