This patient with upper respiratory symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion) now has a
barking cough, retractions, and inspiratory stridor, symptoms suggestive of croup.

Croup is a viral infection caused by the parainfluenza virus most commonly seen in children
age 6 months to 3 years. The virus spreads from the nasopharyngeal mucosa to the larynx
and trachea, causing inflammation and edema of the proximal trachea (ie, subglottis).
Narrowing at this area creates a partial airway obstruction, which results in inspiratory
stridor, hoarseness, and a barking cough. X-ray may reveal subglottic narrowing (ie, steeple
sign).
