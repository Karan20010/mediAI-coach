(Choice A) Contact precautions involve wearing nonsterile gloves for all patient contact and
gowns during substantial contact with infective material. These precautions are indicated
when caring for patients with specific multidrug-resistant bacteria (eg, methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci) or with certain parasitic or viral
pathogens. This patient's methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus infection does not
require use of contact precautions.

(Choice C) Isolation precautions are indicated in the care of patients with infectious airborne
diseases (eg, tuberculosis) and involve a private airborne infection isolation room with negative
air pressure, closed doors, and the use of specialized particulate respirator masks.

(Choice D) Facemasks are used as a barrier for respiratory secretions and are not a
substitute for hand-washing.

(Choice E) Restricting visitors is unnecessary, although all visitors should wash their hands
before and after contact with the patient.
