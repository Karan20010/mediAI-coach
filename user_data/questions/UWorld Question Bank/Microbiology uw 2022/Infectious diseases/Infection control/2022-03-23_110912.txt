subsequently spread to the bloodstream. BSI should be suspected when a patient with an

‘ia

intravascular catheter develops new-onset fever or bacteremia.

(Choice A) Although S aureus is a leading cause of infective endocarditis in patients with
artificial heart valves, bacteremia is much more commonly caused by intravascular devices.

(Choice B) The increased use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is associated with the
development of drug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA).
Although MRSA is a common cause of skin abscess and necrotizing pneumonia, the majority
of S aureus bacteremia is caused by intravascular catheters.

(Choice C) Injection drug use is a major risk factor for S aureus abscess, bacteremia, and
infective endocarditis. However, injection drug use causes far fewer BSls than intravenous
catheters.

(Choice D) Immunosuppression increases the risk of BSI due to reduced
immunosurveillance. However, BSI is far more often due to the use of intravascular catheters.

(Choice E) Indwelling urinary catheters increase the risk of urinary infection with subsequent
hematogenous spread of the organism. However, most cases are caused by gram-negative
enteric organisms such as E coli.
