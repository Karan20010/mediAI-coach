(Choice A) Chlorhexidine works by destabilizing cell membranes and coagulating intracellular
constituents. In combination with 70% alcohol, it is the antiseptic of choice for many surgical
and percutaneous procedures. Its use is contraindicated in neurologic, otologic, and
ophthalmologic procedures due to neurotoxicity.

(Choice B) Formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde function by alkylating and cross-linking DNA
and proteins. They are most commonly used for sterilization of hospital instruments that
cannot withstand autoclave temperatures.

(Choice D) lodine causes halogenation of proteins and DNA. Solutions containing iodine are
frequently used for antisepsis in surgical and percutaneous procedures. However, they are
less effective than chlorhexidine-alcohol and cause more skin irritation and toxicity.

(Choice E) Hydrogen peroxide functions as an oxidant by producing hydroxyl free radicals
that attack cellular components. It is excellent at disinfecting inanimate objects but is less
effective when used on organic materials. Hydrogen peroxide is often used for skin cleansing
and wound debridement due to its effervescent quality.
