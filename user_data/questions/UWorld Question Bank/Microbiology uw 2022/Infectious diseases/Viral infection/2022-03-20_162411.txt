Q fever is a zoonosis caused by Coxiella burnetii. Human infection usually occurs through
inhalation of bacteria from air contaminated by animal waste. Q fever has acute and chronic
stages. Acute Q fever manifests as a nonspecific febrile illness with fever lasting >10 days,
fatigue, and myalgias. Severe debilitating headaches, which are often retroorbital and
associated with photophobia, are a frequent symptom. Pneumonia is one of the primary signs
of acute Q fever, and the most common x-ray abnormality is lobar consolidation. Leukocyte
count is often normal. Other classic laboratory findings are increased liver enzymes and
thrombocytopenia. Chronic Q fever, which is frequently fatal if not treated, is rare, may occur
in patients with or without previous symptomatic acute infection, and manifests as infective
endocarditis in patients with valvular disease.
