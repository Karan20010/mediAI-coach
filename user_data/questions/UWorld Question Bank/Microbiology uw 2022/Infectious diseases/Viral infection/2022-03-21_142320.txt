(Choice B) In young children, hand-foot-and-mouth disease is caused by coxsackievirus.
Painful vesicles develop in the oropharynx and on the hands (eg, palms, dorsal fingers) and
feet (eg, soles, sides). Coxsackievirus can also cause herpangina, an illness characterized by
fever with posterior pharyngeal vesicles and without a rash.

(Choice C) Influenza viruses cause acute onset of high fever, cough, muscle aches, and
malaise with a peak incidence during the winter. In children, infection can be complicated by
febrile seizures, vomiting, acute otitis media, and pneumonia.

(Choice D) Norovirus causes rapid-onset, self-limiting gastroenteritis in outbreak settings (eg,
restaurants, child care facilities, cruise ships). In addition to vomiting and diarrhea, fever,
headache, and malaise are common.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) in school-aged
children and presents with fever, malaise, and a classic "slapped cheek" rash.

(Choice F) Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) classically causes lower respiratory tract disease
(eg, bronchiolitis, pneumonia) in infants. Although older children and adults can develop
respiratory infection and outbreaks can occur in close quarters, RSV is a seasonal virus that
peaks in the winter months.
