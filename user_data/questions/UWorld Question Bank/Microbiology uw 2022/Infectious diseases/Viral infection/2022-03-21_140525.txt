However, there are 4 dengue virus serotypes, and secondary infection with a different viral
serotype is common and is usually associated with more severe illness. Secondary
infections are particularly likely to cause dengue shock syndrome, a life-threatening
dysregulation marked by increased capillary permeability, circulatory collapse (eg, shock), and
end-organ damage (eg, stupor).

Although the exact pathogenesis of dengue shock syndrome remains unclear, it is probably
due to the formation of nonneutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies during primary infection
that then trigger antibody-dependent enhancement of secondary infection. There may also
be accelerated (not blunted) T-lymphocyte activity against secondary infection due to display
of cross-reacting viral antigens on major histocompatibility complexes of infected cells (Choice
B).
