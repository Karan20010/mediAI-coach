can prevent chronic infection.

(Choice A) Due to their immature immune system, more than 90% of vertically infected
infants develop chronic infection (eg, they do not develop anti-HBs and do not clear their HBV
infection). Additionally, the infant's mother has chronic disease and lacks anti-HBs, meaning
there would be no maternally derived transplacental antibodies. Therefore, anti-HBs would not

be expected in this infant.

(Choices C and D) Hepatic injury from hepatitis B is due to the cellular immune response, not
by the virus itself. Therefore, infants with HBV infection enter an immune-tolerant phase due
to their immature T-cell responses, which limits hepatocyte damage. As a result, laboratory
markers of liver injury (eg, liver function tests, direct bilirubinemia) are usually normal or only
mildly elevated in HBV-infected neonates.

(Choice E) Perinatally infected infants have rapid appearance of HBsAg within a few days;

absence of both HBsAg and anti-HBs at age 2 months would suggest that the infant was not
infected. However, this is unlikely as virtually all infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers will
be infected perinatally.
