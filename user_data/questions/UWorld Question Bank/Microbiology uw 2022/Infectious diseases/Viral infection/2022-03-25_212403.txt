Genetic shift in the influenza A virus involves reassortment of genomic segments of the

human strain with genomic segments of the animal strain, typically when both strains coinfect
birds (avian) or pigs (swine). The resulting new strain can cause a new influenza epidemic or

a

pandemic if it has dramatically altered viral surface glycoproteins (eg, hemagglutinin).

The key structural feature that enables influenza viruses to undergo such relatively rapid
genetic shifts through reassortment is the segmented nature of their genomes. Members of
another virus family with a segmented genome could also undergo such reassortment - as
opposed to the less radical, slower genetic drift that occurs via point mutations in all viral
families. Among the viruses listed, only rotavirus has a segmented genome. Segmented
viruses include orthomyxoviruses, reoviruses, bunyaviruses, and arenaviruses.

(Choices A, B, C, and D) Hepatitis C virus, human papillomavirus, measles virus, and
poliovirus all lack the segmented genome necessary to undergo reassortment.

Educational objective:

Viruses with segmented genomes (eg, orthomyxoviruses, rotaviruses) are capable of genetic
shifts through reassortment. Reassortment (genetic shift) involves exchange of entire genomic
segments, a far more dramatic process than the point mutations responsible for genetic drift.
