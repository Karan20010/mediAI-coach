Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an epithelial tumor that usually originates in the pharyngeal
recess. Local tumor growth often leads to epistaxis and headaches, and metastatic spread to
cervical lymph nodes frequently causes firm, fixed neck swelling. NPC is relatively uncommon
in the United States but is endemic to southern China, where genetic and dietary factors (eg,
consumption of salted fish) predispose to premalignant nasopharyngeal epithelial lesions.
Subsequent malignant transformation is then induced by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).
