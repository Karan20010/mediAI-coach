Hepatitis B virus infection can produce one of three syndromes: acute hepatitis with complete
resolution; chronic hepatitis (with or without cirrhosis and the attendant increased risk of
hepatocellular carcinoma); or fulminant hepatitis with massive liver necrosis. By far the most
common outcome in HBV-infected adults (> 95%) is acute hepatitis with mild or subclinical

symptoms that eventually completely resolve.
