(Choice B) Clostridioides difficile infection causes exotoxin-mediated damage to the large
intestine mucosa, leading to the development of yellow-white pseudomembranes. Cases are
most common after recent antibiotic therapy and usually present with watery diarrhea, fever,
and abdominal pain. C difficile is a spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium.

(Choice C) Entamoeba histolytica is an anaerobic parasite that commonly causes dysentery
and extraintestinal disease (eg, liver abscess) in the developing world. Gastrointestinal
infection usually results in bloody stools and fever; colonic visualization classically reveals
flask-shaped ulcers (ie, with overhanging edges) in the cecum and ascending colon.

(Choice D) Whipple disease is caused by the gram-positive bacillus Tropheryma whipplei.
Histopathology of the small intestine classically shows foamy macrophages in the lamina
propria. Manifestations usually include arthralgias and chronic diarrhea with malabsorption
and weight loss.

(Choice E) Typhoid strains of Salmonella pass through enterocytes and invade macrophages
in the intestinal submucosa and Peyer patches. Inflammation and necrosis of Peyer patches
can lead to life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation.
