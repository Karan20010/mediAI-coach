Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a small, enveloped RNA virus that does not contain a replicase or
RNA polymerase. Therefore, the virus is completely reliant on host cell machinery for
transcription and translation. In addition, HDV is considered a replication-defective virus
because it does not encode for viral envelope proteins, which are necessary to generate viral
progeny. HDV can only finish its replication cycle in the setting of coinfection with hepatitis
B virus (HBV). HBV encodes for several envelope proteins (HBsAg) that are used to
generate the envelope of HDV. Therefore, universal vaccination against HBV would
completely eliminate HDV.

HDV infection can occur as an acute coinfection with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in a
chronic HBV carrier. Infection with HDV dramatically increases the already elevated risk of
cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma seen with HBV.
