(Choice A) Acute HCV can cause acute (eg, fulminant) liver failure, a life-threatening
condition characterized by encephalopathy and impaired hepatic synthetic function (eg,
prolonged prothrombin time). However, this is a rare manifestation and is much less common
than chronic HCV.

Educational objective:

The most common outcome of hepatitis C infection without antiviral treatment is lifelong
persistent infection (ie, chronic hepatitis C). Of those with chronic hepatitis C, approximately
20% develop cirrhosis, and only a minority experiences complications (eg, ascites, variceal
bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma).
