Researchers find that even though the current recombinant hepatitis B vaccine is
immunogenic, about 10% of immunocompetent individuals do not develop high enough levels
of anti-HB antibodies to confer immunity despite receiving the recommended 3 doses of the
vaccine. To increase the vaccine immunogenicity, they use a lipopolysaccharide derivative as
a vaccine adjuvant. The new vaccine induces an exaggerated immune response in previous
nonresponders, which results in high antibody titers and, possibly, lifelong protection.
Universal vaccination with the new vaccine would most likely lead to eradication of which of
the following conditions?

©) A. Fulminant viral hepatitis

©) B. Hepatitis C infection

©) C. Hepatitis D infection

©) D. Hepatocellular carcinoma

() E. Membranous glomerulopathy
©) F. Mixed cryoglobulinemia
