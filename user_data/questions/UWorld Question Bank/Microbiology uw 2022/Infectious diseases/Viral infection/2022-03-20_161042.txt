This patient's history of fever, cough, congestion, and conjunctivitis followed by a
maculopapular rash is consistent with measles. Measles is a highly contagious
paramyxovirus that spreads by contact or aerosolized respiratory droplets. This vaccine-
preventable infection can be life-threatening. The classic exanthema starts on the face and
spreads in a cephalocaudal and centrifugal pattern. Erythematous, blanching, maculopapular
lesions often progress to a deep red or brown, nonblanching, coalesced rash.

Vitamin A supplementation is recommended, especially in patients with vitamin A deficiency.
Acute measles infection depletes vitamin A stores, resulting in a risk of keratitis and corneal
ulceration. Vitamin A helps prevent and treat these ocular complications. In addition, it
reduces risk of other comorbidities (eg, pneumonia, encephalitis), recovery time, and length
of hospital stay. No other vitamin is linked to measles.
