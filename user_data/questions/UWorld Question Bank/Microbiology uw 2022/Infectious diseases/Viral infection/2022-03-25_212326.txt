Studies conducted following an influenza epidemic that affected the inhabitants of several
countries determine that the cause is an antigenically novel virus strain carrying the animal-
strain hemagglutinin and neuraminidase surface molecules. Further analysis reveals that
reassortment of the genetic materials occurred during coinfection with human influenza virus
and swine influenza virus, leading to the development of some progeny that contain genetic
materials from both viruses. Which of the following viruses can undergo a similar process?

©) A. Hepatitis C virus

©) B. Human papillomavirus
|) C. Measles virus

©) D. Poliovirus
