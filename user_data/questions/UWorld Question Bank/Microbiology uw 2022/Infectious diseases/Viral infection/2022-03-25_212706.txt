Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor useful in the treatment of both influenza A and B
virus infections. Neuraminidase is required for the release of virus from infected cells and for
the spread of virus within the respiratory tract. Neuraminidase inhibitors cause the newly
synthesized virions to adhere to the host cell surface and form viral aggregates, thereby
reducing the spread of virus to other host cells. Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) can shorten the course
and complications of influenza A and B infections if taken within 48 hours of the onset of
symptoms. In addition, oseltamivir works to slow viral penetration of the mucous secretions
that protect the respiratory epithelium. Oseltamivir can therefore be used to treat or prevent

influenza.
