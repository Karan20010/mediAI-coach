This patient has molluscum contagiosum (MC), a benign skin condition caused by a
poxvirus. MC is most common in young children, but older patients who are sexually active,
participate in contact sports, or are immunocompromised (eg, HIV) are also at increased risk.

MC classically presents as firm, shiny, dome-shaped, flesh-colored papules that often have
a central umbilication. Lesions are nontender but may be pruritic. Affected areas in adults
usually include the lower abdomen, genitalia, and upper thighs because sexual contact is the
most common route of transmission. However, autoinoculation can lead to spread on any part
of the body (except the palms and soles), and patients who are immunosuppressed are at
increased risk for widespread disease.

Microscopy of the lesions shows intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies (molluscum
bodies) composed of poxvirus within keratinocytes in the epidermis. Lesions usually self-
resolve within 6-12 months but typically last longer in immunocompromised patients.
