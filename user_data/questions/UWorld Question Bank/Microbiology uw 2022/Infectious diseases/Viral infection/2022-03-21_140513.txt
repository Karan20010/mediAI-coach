This patient recently traveled to South America and now has several manifestations of
dengue, a Fiavivirus infection transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes. Although primary
(first) infections can be asymptomatic, adult patients may develop high fever, retroorbital pain,
and severe myalgia/arthralgia, which gives dengue its common name breakbone fever.
Hemorrhagic symptoms (eg, epistaxis, petechiae/purpura) can also occur, and laboratory
evaluation often shows leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminases. Most
primary infections resolve spontaneously within 3-5 days and lead to lifelong protective
immunity against the infecting viral serotype.
