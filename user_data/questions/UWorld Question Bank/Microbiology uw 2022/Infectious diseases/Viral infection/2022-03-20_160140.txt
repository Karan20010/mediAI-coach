(Choices B, C, and F) Unlike hepatitis B or C, HAV infection is a self-limiting disease that is
not associated with an asymptomatic viral carrier state and does not progress to chronic
hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.

(Choice D) Immunity against hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection would be signaled by anti-HDV
IgG antibodies, not anti-HAV IgG antibodies.

(Choice G) Reinfection with HAV would be associated with the presence of anti-HAV IgM
antibodies. Individuals who have persistent anti-HAV IgG antibodies typically enjoy immunity
to repeat HAV infection.

(Choice H) Acute hepatitis B infection is sometimes associated with a window period where
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is no longer present but anti-HBsAg is not yet detectable
in serum.
