encephalitis, which usually presents with rapidly progressive altered mental state and focal
neurologic deficits. However, this condition is highly inflammatory so brain imaging typically
shows enhancing lesions.

(Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus reactivation can cause primary CNS lymphoma in patients with
advanced AIDS. Patients usually have focal neurologic symptoms and altered mental state.
However, brain MRI normally reveals a single enhancing lesion with mass effect.

(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus encephalitis usually causes focal neurologic deficits and
altered mental status. However, symptom onset is usually rapid (<1 week), most patients have
fever, and brain imaging usually reveals an enhancing temporal lobe lesion with mass effect.

(Choice E) Measles can cause subacute, sclerosing panencephalitis several years after initial
infection. This fatal, progressive disease is characterized by slowly worsening neurologic
symptoms and multifocal, enhancing, white matter lesions.

(Choice F) Toxoplasma gondii is usually acquired by exposure to cat feces. Most patients are
asymptomatic and have a life-long dormant infection. However, patients with advanced AIDS
can have reactivation leading to meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, fever). Brain

imaging usually shows several ring-enhancing lesions with surrounding edema.
