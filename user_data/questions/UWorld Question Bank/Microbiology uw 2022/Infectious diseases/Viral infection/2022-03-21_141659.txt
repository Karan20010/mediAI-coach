Restlessness, agitation, and dysphagia progressing to coma within weeks of exploring a bat
cave is concerning for rabies encephalitis. Although bats (and, almost as commonly,
raccoons) are among the main sources of rabies in the United States, many patients with bat
rabies are not aware that they had been bitten. Once in a wound, the virus travels retrograde
via peripheral nerves to the dorsal root ganglia and then to the brain, where replication occurs.
The virus then spreads to other organs through neural pathways. Common manifestations
include a nonspecific, flu-like prodrome followed by an acute neurologic syndrome with
agitation, persistent fever, variable consciousness, and painful spasms with swallowing or
inspiration (causing dysphagia, hydrophobia, and aerophobia). Generalized flaccid paralysis
and coma ensue, with most patients dying within weeks.

Prophylactic vaccination is recommended for individuals at high exposure risk (eg,
veterinarians, cave explorers, laboratory workers handling infected tissues, travelers to
countries where rabid dogs are prevalent). Postexposure prophylaxis (a medical
emergency) generally includes rabies immune globulin and vaccination; it is not effective after
symptom onset. The approved rabies vaccines consist of various rhabdovirus strains grown
in tissue cell culture and inactivated by beta-propiolactone.
