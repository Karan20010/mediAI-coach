Patients who undergo organ transplantation and are on immunosuppressive therapy are at risk
for cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation with end-organ disease (eg, colitis, retinitis,
pneumonitis). This patient has classic manifestations of CMV colitis including fever, fatigue,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Because serum testing for CMV DNA may be negative, patients
with suspected CMV colitis usually undergo colonoscopy with biopsy. Typical findings include
colonic mucosal erythema/ulcerations. Biopsy generally reveals large cells with intranuclear
and intracytoplasmic inclusions ("owl's-eye" appearance).

First-line therapy for CMV colitis is intravenous ganciclovir. This guanine nucleoside
analogue interferes with viral DNA replication by competitively inhibiting the incorporation of
guanosine triphosphate into CMV DNA strands by CMV DNA polymerase. However, this drug
also impedes human DNA polymerase to a lesser degree and can interfere with host cell
replication, particularly in areas of high turnover (eg, hematologic progenitor cells). Therefore,
ganciclovir is often associated with prominent hematologic side effects such as neutropenia,
anemia, and thrombocytopenia.
