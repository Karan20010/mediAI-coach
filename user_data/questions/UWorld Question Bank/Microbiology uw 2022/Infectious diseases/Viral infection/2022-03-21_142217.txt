(Choice B) Although hepatitis B, C, and D can be transmitted parenterally (with patients with
intravenous drug use and hemophilia at particularly high risk), hepatitis A and E are primarily
transmitted via the fecal-oral route.

(Choice C) Hepatitis E causes an acute illness and is not associated with chronic infection.

(Choice D) Unlike hepatitis D virus, hepatitis E is not dependent on HBsAg for infection and
multiplication.

(Choice E) Because of their association with hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatitis B and C
have been suggested to have oncogenic properties. Hepatitis E is not associated with an
increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, however.
