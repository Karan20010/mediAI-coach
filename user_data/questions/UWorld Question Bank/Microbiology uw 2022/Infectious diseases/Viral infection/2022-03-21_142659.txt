Educational objective:

Aedes mosquitoes transmit the viruses that cause dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and yellow
fever; simultaneous outbreaks and coinfections are common. Dengue usually presents as an
acute febrile illness with headache, retroorbital pain, arthralgia, and myalgia; hemorrhagic
signs (eg, thrombocytopenia, petechiae, mucosal bleeding) often occur within days.
