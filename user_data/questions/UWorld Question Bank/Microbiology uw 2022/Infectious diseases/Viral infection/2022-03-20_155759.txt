Measles virus, or rubeola, is an enveloped, nonsegmented, negative-sense RNA virus of the
Paramyxoviridae family. This highly contagious infection is transmitted by airborne or
person-to-person contact. Classically, measles presents with a prodrome of fever, cough,
rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis. Koplik spots on the buccal mucosa are a pathognomonic
finding and consist of small white, blue, or gray specks on an erythematous base. These
symptoms precede a maculopapular exanthem that starts on the face and spreads down the
trunk and extremities.

The parentsâ€™ refusal of preventive medicine also supports a diagnosis of measles as the child

likely did not receive the recommended combined measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine. This live, attenuated vaccine is safe; serious side effects are extremely rare.
