(Choice A) The HIV envelope proteins gp120 and gp41 mediate viral attachment and fusion
with the host cell membrane. These proteins are generated as a polyprotein (gp160) from the
env gene. Unlike the gag-pol polyprotein (which is cleaved by HIV protease) the env
polyprotein is cleaved by a host protease, so production of glycosylated viral envelope proteins
is not affected by HIV protease inhibitors.

(Choices B and D) The po/ gene encodes the major HIV enzymes: reverse transcriptase
(RT), integrase, and protease. RT converts the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-
stranded DNA; it also destroys the HIV RNA genomic template during transcription
(ribonuclease H activity). RT is inhibited by nucleoside/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors. Integrase inserts complementary viral DNA into the host chromosome. Integrase
strand transfer inhibitors block the function of this enzyme. Both RT and integrase inhibitors
block viral replication, but neither are associated with immature virions containing polyproteins.

(Choice E) The HIV genome encodes for several regulatory proteins that are required for viral
replication. However, all virus-encoded proteins are translated by host ribosomes, and
blockade of protein translation would not be associated with the formation of polyproteins.
