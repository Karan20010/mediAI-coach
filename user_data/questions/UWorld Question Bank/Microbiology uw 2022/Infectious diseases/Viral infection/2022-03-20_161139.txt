Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Symptoms include diarrhea,
vomiting, fever, malaise, and headache. The diarrhea is typically watery without blood or

mucus due to lack of small bowel inflammation.

Norovirus (part of the Calicivirus family) possesses a linear, nonenveloped, single-stranded
RNA genome. It is resistant to inactivation by acid, bile, and pancreatic enzymes. As a result,
norovirus is easily transmitted via fecal-oral spread (eg, foodborne, person-to-person via
contaminated bodily fluids) and results in outbreaks in crowded settings (eg, schools,
hospitals, cruise ships, nursing homes). The incubation period is 1-2 days; symptoms develop
acutely and self-resolve within days. The diagnosis is typically based solely on clinical
presentation, but polymerase chain reaction testing may be performed to confirm an outbreak.
