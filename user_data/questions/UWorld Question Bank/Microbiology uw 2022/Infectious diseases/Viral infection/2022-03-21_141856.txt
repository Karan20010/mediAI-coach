Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) commonly infects B cells, stimulating them to enter the cell cycle
and proliferate continuously ("transformation" or "immortalization"). This is accomplished
when EBV-encoded oncogenes activate proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways
within the infected B cell. In an immunocompetent host, a vigorous immune response holds
EBV-induced B cell proliferation in check. The immortalized B cells maintain the ability to
secrete immunoglobulins (lg) and B-cell activation products (eg, CD23), with very few of
them releasing virus particles at any one time.

Diagnosing EBV infection relies on detecting a heterogeneous group of heterophile IgM
antibodies that react with antigens on horse erythrocytes (or sheep erythrocytes in the classic
Paul Bunnell test). Agglutination of these horse erythrocytes by human serum is a sensitive
and highly specific (~100%) test for EBV infection in human B cells. The mechanism remains
unclear; EBV either induces a humoral response to heterophile antigens or stimulates
nonspecific polyclonal activation of B cells.
