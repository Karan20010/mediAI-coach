(Choices B and E) Persistence of HBsAg in the bloodstream indicates chronic hepatitis.
Patients with no circulating HBeAg, presence of anti-HBe, and low viral loads have a lower risk
of disease progression and are less likely to transmit HBV.

(Choice D) The presence of anti-hepatitis A virus (HAV) IgG suggests that this patient is
protected from acute HAV infection. It is impossible to determine from the information given
whether the anti-HAV IgG is due to previous infection or immunization with the hepatitis A
vaccine.

(Choice F) The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is replication defective and depends on the genetic
information provided by HBV for replication. This individual is not infected with HBV (her
HBsAg is negative) and therefore cannot be infected with HDV.
