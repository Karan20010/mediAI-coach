Educational objective:

Inactivated (killed or component) viral vaccines primarily generate a humoral immune
response against extracellular viral antigens, preventing viral entry into the cell. In contrast,
live attenuated viral vaccines can generate a strong cell-mediated immune response that can
kill virally-infected cells, in addition to providing humoral immunity.
