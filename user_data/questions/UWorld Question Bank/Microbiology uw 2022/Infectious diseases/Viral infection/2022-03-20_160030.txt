(Choice A) Coxsackievirus A16 is a common cause of hand-foot-mouth disease in children.
Patients typically have erythematous oropharyngeal ulcers and maculopapular or vesicular
lesions on the palms and soles.

(Choice B) Children with primary infection with herpes-simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) have
painful gingivostomatitis, often accompanied by fever and irritability. Neonatal HSV, most
commonly caused by HSV-2, can present with fever and seizures in the newborn period.

(Choices D and F) Rubella and measles are vaccine-preventable viral infections that typically
present with a maculopapular rash on the face that then spreads to the trunk and extremities.
Both infections can be distinguished from roseola by the pattern of rash development. In
addition, patients with rubella often have Forchheimer spots on the soft palate, and measles is
characterized by pathognomonic Koplik spots on buccal mucosa.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, which can present
as a flulike illness followed by a characteristic "slapped cheek" rash and truncal reticular rash.
Parvovirus B19 can be associated with an aplastic crisis in those with pre-existing hematologic
