Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of colitis in patients with advanced AIDS. Itis the
second most common CMV reactivation disease in this population (CMV retinitis is the most
common). Patients with CMV colitis often have abdominal pain, fever, diarrhea, and weight
loss. Colonoscopy usually shows erythema, erosions, and ulcerations; colonic biopsy typically
reveals large cells with prominent basophilic intranuclear inclusions.
