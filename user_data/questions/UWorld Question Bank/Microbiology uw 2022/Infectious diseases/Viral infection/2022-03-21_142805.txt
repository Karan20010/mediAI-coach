(Choice B) Histoplasmosis is an endemic mycosis of the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys
that can be transmitted by bird or bat droppings. Most patients are asymptomatic, but a
minority develop pneumonia. Dissemination to the CNS can occur occasionally but is
associated with focal brain lesions on imaging.

(Choice C) Meningococcal meningitis requires isolation of infected individuals (droplet
precautions) to prevent transmission. Patients often initially develop flu-like symptoms that
can progress within hours to petechial/hemorrhagic rash, sepsis, and death. Cerebrospinal
fluid will show neutrophilic pleocytosis.

(Choice D) Aseptic meningitis is often caused by enteroviruses (eg, Coxsackievirus,
echovirus) that are transmitted via the fecal-oral route through contaminated food or water.
However, enteroviruses are less likely to cause signs of encephalitis (eg, confusion, focal
neurologic deficits, tremors, seizures) than arboviruses.
