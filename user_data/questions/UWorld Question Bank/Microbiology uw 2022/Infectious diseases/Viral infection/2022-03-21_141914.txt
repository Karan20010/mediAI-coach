(Choice B) Cryoglobulins, cold-precipitable serum proteins that contain Igs, are most
commonly associated with hepatitis C virus infection.

(Choice C) Some influenza and parainfluenza viruses are associated with hemadsorption
(hemagglutinins or glycoproteins with a high affinity for erythrocytes expressed on the host cell
surface). Hemadsorption is not characteristic of EBV.

(Choice E) The Papanicolaou test is used to screen cervical cytology specimens for dysplasia
caused by oncogenic strains of human papillomavirus.

(Choice F) Tzanck smear is used to diagnose herpes simplex or varicella zoster virus
infection. The epithelial cells scraped from the ulcer base are prepared with a Wright-Giemsa
stain and examined for multinucleated giant cells and intranuclear inclusions.
