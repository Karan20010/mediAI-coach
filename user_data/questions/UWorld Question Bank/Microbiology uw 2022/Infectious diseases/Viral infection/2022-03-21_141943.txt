This infant with worsening cough and respiratory distress has diffuse wheezing and crackles,
findings suggestive of bronchiolitis. Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory tract infection that
typically affects children age <2 years, usually during the fall and winter. The most common
cause is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Initial symptoms include rhinorrhea and congestion, followed by cough, low-grade fever, and
increased work of breathing. Classic findings include hypoxemia, tachypnea, and retractions
with diffuse wheezes and crackles. Although illness severity typically peaks at 3-5 days,
cough may last several weeks.

In older infants and young children, bronchiolitis is typically a mild, self-limited illness.
However, in premature or young (age <2 months) infants, symptoms may be severe (eg,
cyanosis, poor perfusion, poor feeding) and lead to apnea and/or respiratory failure.

Diagnosis of bronchiolitis is clinical, and treatment is supportive (eg, supplemental oxygen,
nasal suctioning).
