Chikungunya is an alphavirus transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical areas.
Initial manifestations include fever, diffuse rash, and severe polyarthralgia. Although fever and
rash quickly resolve, many patients have chronic arthralgia, polyarthritis (eg, wrist, fingers,
ankles), or tenosynovitis.
