This patient, who is HIV negative, has a positive titer for cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG,
suggesting prior CMV infection. CMV is a rare cause of disease in the immunocompetent, with
the virus more typically responsible for subclinical infection. When primary CMV infection does
result in clinically evident illness, affected individuals appear to have a systemic
mononucleosis-like syndrome characterized by fever, malaise, myalgia, atypical
lymphocytosis, and elevated liver transaminases. In contrast to Epstein-Barr virus
mononucleosis (most common), heterophile antibodies are not usually present in patients with
CMV mononucleosis (negative Monospot test).
