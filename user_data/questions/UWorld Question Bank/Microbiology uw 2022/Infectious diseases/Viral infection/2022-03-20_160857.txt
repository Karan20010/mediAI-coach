Zika virus is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus. Transmission
occurs primarily via an Aedes mosquito bite, but infected patients can also spread the virus via
genital secretions. The neurotropic virus can cross the placenta and infect and destroy fetal
neural progenitor cells, causing congenital Zika syndrome and possible fetal demise. Fetal
brain development is impaired due to disruption of normal proliferation, migration, and
differentiation of neurons.

Classic findings in affected newborns include microcephaly with facial features out of
proportion to head size, arthrogryposis (contractures), seizures, hypertonia, and ocular
abnormalities. Loss of brain mass (eg, cortical thinning, ventriculomegaly) as well as
subcortical calcifications are typically present. Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of Zika
RNA (real-time reverse transcriptase PCR) in serum, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid.

The mainstay of treatment for surviving infants is supportive care with management of feeding
difficulties, hydrocephalus, and seizures. Pregnant women should be counseled to avoid
traveling to areas with ongoing Zika transmission (eg, South and Central America, Asia, Africa,
Mexico, the Caribbean).
