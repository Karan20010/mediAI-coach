EBV is a ubiquitous human herpes virus that causes infectious mononucleosis in a minority of
patients (primary infection is usually asymptomatic). Initial infection is followed by life-long
latent infection in memory B cells. While latent, the EBV genome exists as an episome in the
nucleus of infected cells and expresses a restricted subset of EBV genes (latency genes)
which do the following:

¢ Promote periodic viral reactivation from memory B-cells, leading to recurrent
(asymptomatic) mucosal infections.

¢ Promote survival of infected memory B cells by encoding for proteins (eg, EBNA-1, LMP1)
that prevent apoptosis. In a minority of patients, these proteins are oncogenic and lead to
malignant transformation of infected B cells (eg, Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma)
or premalignant epithelial cells (eg, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, salivary cancer).

Individuals who do not have premalignant epithelial lesions are at very low risk of EBV-
associated epithelial cancers like NPC.
