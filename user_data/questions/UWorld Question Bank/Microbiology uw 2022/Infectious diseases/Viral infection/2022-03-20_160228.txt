Educational objective:

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is typically associated with subclinical infection in the
immunocompetent, with the occasional individual developing a mononucleosis-like syndrome
that is heterophile antibody (Monospot) negative. In the immunocompromised, primary or
reactivated CMV infection can result in severe retinitis, pneumonia, esophagitis, colitis, or
hepatitis.
