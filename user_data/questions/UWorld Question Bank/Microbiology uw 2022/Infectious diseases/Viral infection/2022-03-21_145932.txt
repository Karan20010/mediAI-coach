(Choice A) Facial nerve palsy (Bell palsy) is classically associated with Lyme disease, which
usually presents with a bull's-eye rash (erythema migrans), not oral ulcers or rash on the
palms.

(Choices B and E) Keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) and temporal lobe encephalitis are
serious complications of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV gingivostomatitis presents
with vesicles on the anterior oral mucosa, particularly the lips, and gingivae. Patients may also
have concomitant herpetic whitlow, which usually appears as clusters of vesicles on the fingers
(not diffuse blisters on the palm). Although Enterovirus may cause CNS complications (eg,
aseptic meningitis), temporal lobe encephalitis is more specific for HSV.

(Choice D) Parvovirus B19 infection (fifth disease) may cause a slapped-cheek appearance
or a diffuse, reticulated rash. In some cases, particularly in women or adolescent girls, the
infection is followed by polyarthralgia or polyarthritis 1-2 weeks later. Enterovirus is not
associated with joint manifestations.
