(Choice A) Acyclovir is a nucleoside analog that must be converted intracellularly to its
monophosphate form by a virally encoded thymidine kinase. Cellular kinases convert the
monophosphate form into a triphosphate form, which inhibits herpesvirus DNA polymerase-

Th

mediated replication.

(Choice D) Lamivudine is a cytosine analog classified as a nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor. It must be phosphorylated to its active form, lamivudine triphosphate, by intracellular
kinases. Lamivudine inhibits HIV reverse transcription through viral DNA chain termination.

(Choices E and F) Oseltamivir and saquinavir do not require intracellular activation but are
not used for CMV infection. Oseltamivir is a sialic acid analogue inhibitor of influenza A and B
virus neuraminidase. Saquinavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that prevents the cleavage of
polyprotein precursors necessary for the generation of functional viral proteins.

(Choice G) Sofosbuvir inhibits nonstructural protein 5B (NS5B), an RNA-dependent RNA
polymerase needed for hepatitis C virus replication. It requires intracellular activation.

Educational objective:
Of all the antiviral agents that bind and inhibit DNA polymerase in herpesvirus and reverse
transcriptase in HIV, the pyrophosphate analog foscarnet is one of few that do not require

intracellular activation by viral or cellular kinases.
