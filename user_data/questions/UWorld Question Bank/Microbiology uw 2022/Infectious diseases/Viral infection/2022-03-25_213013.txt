Traditional vaccinations are generally divided into the following categories:

¢ Live attenuated vaccinations introduce a disabled virus that replicates but causes
minimal illness. Because the virus infects host cells, it produces a long-lasting humoral
and cell-mediated immune response against a diverse range of viral antigens that mirrors
that of a normal infection.

¢ Inactivated vaccinations introduce viral fragments that are taken up by antigen
presenting cells and displayed to B and T lymphocytes. However, because the virus does
not replicate with host cells, they tend to elicit a short-acting humoral immune response
and less robust cell-mediated response; multiple doses and booster shots are often
required to provide effective immunity.

Although live attenuated and inactivated virus immunizations are effective, their development
requires years or decades and is often more difficult for nonmicrobial antigens (eg, cancer
cell antigens). In contrast, mRNA vaccinations can be rapidly synthesized in vitro and can
be targeted to produce any known protein (eq, viral spike protein, cancer antigens). Once in
the cytoplasm, the exogenous mRNA is translated by host ribosomes to the encoded viral
protein, which then translocates to the cell surface. This triggers a strong B- and T-cell—
mediated immune response against the foreign protein, leading to long-lasting immunity.
