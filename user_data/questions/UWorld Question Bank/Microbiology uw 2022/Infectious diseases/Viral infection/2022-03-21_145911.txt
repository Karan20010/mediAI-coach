This patient has characteristic findings of hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), an infection
caused by Enterovirus. HFMD is characterized by a painful oral enanthem consisting of
vesicles/ulcers usually affecting the tongue, buccal mucosa, or soft palate as well as a
maculopapular or vesicular exanthem on the hands and feet (including palms and soles).
Illness may be accompanied by a fever and is usually self-limited.

Other presentations of Enterovirus infection include the following:

e Herpangina: This condition is not associated with an exanthem but causes high fever and
a painful oral enanthem primarily affecting the posterior oropharynx and sparing the
gingiva.

¢ Myocarditis: Patients often present with a viral prodrome (eg, fever, myalgia) followed by
signs of heart failure, such as dyspnea, tachypnea, and tachycardia. Myocarditis may also

occur as a rare complication of HFMD due to widespread viremia prior to the development
of protective antibodies.

¢ Aseptic meningitis: Enterovirus is the most common cause of viral meningitis and occurs
most frequently in infants. Similar to myocarditis, it may also occur as a complication of
HFMD.
