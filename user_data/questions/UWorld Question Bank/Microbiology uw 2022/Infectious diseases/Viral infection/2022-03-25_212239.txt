(Choice A) Elastase breaks down collagen and is released by neutrophils and macrophages
during acute inflammation. Neutrophils have multi-lobe nuclei and pinkish cytoplasm;
macrophages have central round nuclei and abundant greyish, vacuolated cytoplasm. Neither
typically has scalloped edges or abundant basophilic cytoplasm.

(Choice B) Immunoglobulins are secreted by plasma cells, which have an eccentric nucleus,
perinuclear paleness (large Golgi apparatus), and spoke-wheel chromatin. Although
immunoglobins cannot typically be visualized on light microscopy, immunoglobulin inclusions
can sometimes be seen in plasma cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma (characterized
by anemia, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal insufficiency).

(Choice C) Eosinophils generate and release major basic protein, which is the core
constituent of eosinophilic granules; it acts as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin and mediates
epithelial damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in hypersensitivity diseases. Eosinophils
have a bilobed nucleus and stain intensely pink.

(Choice E) Ribosomes generate proteins from messenger RNA; they can be visualized by
electron microscopy but usually cannot be seen on light microscopy. However, ribosomal
aggregates can sometimes be seen as basophilic stippling in patients with thalassemia or
alcoholism.
