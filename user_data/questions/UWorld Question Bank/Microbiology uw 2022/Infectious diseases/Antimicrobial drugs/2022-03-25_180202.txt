In prokaryotes, a unique MRNA sequence (Shine-Dalgarno) is located upstream from
initiation codon AUG, which recognizes an N-formylmethionine-tRNA. This sequence allows
30S binding to MRNA and this N-formylmethionine-tRNA (forming the prokaryotic 30S
initiation complex). The energy for this reaction (GTP hydrolysis) brings the 50S subunit into
the initiation complex, resulting in a 70S ribosomal unit.

AGs irreversibly bind to bacterial 30S but not eukaryotic 40S; this causes genetic code
misreading and bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. AGs also appear to impact
translocation, whereby an aminoacyl-tRNA is shifted from the ribosomal A site (after initial
binding) to the P site (after AA incorporation into the peptide chain during elongation) to the E
site (after AA cleaving from its tRNA). The initial N-formylmethionine-tRNA notably binds at the
P site.
