peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. Inhibition a ranspepidase (which occurs with the use
of the cephalosporin ceftriaxone) leads to cell wall instability and bacteriolysis. Many bacterial
species synthesize multiple different penicillin-binding proteins; the laboratory study described
in this question stem identifies 5 such proteins that are produced by this isolate of
Streptococcus pneumoniae.

(Choice A) Vancomycin binds to the terminal D-alanine residues of cell wall glycoproteins and
prevents transpeptidases from forming cross-links.

(Choice B) Fluoroquinolones interfere with DNA replication by binding to proteins such as
DNA gyrase.

(Choice C) Porins are utilized by bacterial organisms as a means of controlling diffusion of
small to medium-sized metabolites. Antibiotic resistance can develop through porin mutations
that prevent antibiotic diffusion through the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. No
known antibiotics function by binding to porins.

(Choice D) Ribosomal proteins are bound by multiple antibiotics including macrolides,
tetracyclines, and others.
