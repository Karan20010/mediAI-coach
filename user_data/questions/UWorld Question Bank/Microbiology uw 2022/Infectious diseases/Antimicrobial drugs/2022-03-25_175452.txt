This patient has had a relapse of acute prostatitis despite an adequate initial response and
good medication adherence. This treatment failure is likely due to a drug-drug interaction
with his home medications.

Fluoroquinolones normally have very high bioavailability and near-complete absorption.
However, they can form insoluble chelate complexes with polyvalent cations (eg, calcium,
iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract. This leads to impaired absorption
and a significant decrease in drug bioavailability. In this patient's case, his initial response to
the antibiotic reflects the parenteral dosing, which bypasses the gastrointestinal tract and
avoids this potential interaction.

Over-the-counter antacids typically contain calcium, magnesium, and/or aluminum salts and
are used by many patients for treatment of heartburn due to gastroesophageal reflux. Calcium
salts (eg, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) are also widely used in the treatment of
osteoporosis. However, since these medications are available without a prescription and are
often taken intermittently, the potential for interaction may not be apparent at the time antibiotic
treatment is initiated.
