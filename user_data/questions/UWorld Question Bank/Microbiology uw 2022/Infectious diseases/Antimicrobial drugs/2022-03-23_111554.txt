Conjugation begins when proteins encoded by the conjugative element aggregate on the
plasma membrane of the donor bacteria, forming a pilus (a hair-like appendage). The pilus
elongates until it attaches to an adjacent bacterium and then progressively shortens, which
pulls the bacteria together. The plasmid DNA in the donor cell is then nicked and relaxed, and
a single DNA strand is transferred through the mating bridge from the donor to the recipient
bacterium. A complimentary DNA strand is then generated in each bacterium, which
completes the plasmid transfer.

Conjugation is a major mechanism for Shigella antibiotic resistance. A single Shigella
plasmid encodes resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamides,
streptomycin, and trimethoprim. Other plasmids encode resistance to azithromycin and
fluoroquinolones. Risk of resistant strains is greatest in patients with HIV and/or men who
have sex with men, but antibiotic susceptibility testing is required for all infections due to high
rates of resistance across patient populations.
