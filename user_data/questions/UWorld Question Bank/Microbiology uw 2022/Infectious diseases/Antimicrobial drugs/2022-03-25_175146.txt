The acute elevation of this patient's serum creatinine on the third day of hospitalization is likely
due to acyclovir nephrotoxicity, which occurs in 5%-10% of patients who receive the drug
intravenously. Acyclovir is excreted principally in the urine via glomerular filtration and tubular
secretion. When the acyclovir concentration in the collecting duct exceeds its solubility,
crystallization, crystalluria, and renal tubular damage can occur. In most cases, this toxic
complication is transient and can be prevented (as well as treated) with adequate hydration
and a reduction in the rate of drug infusion.
