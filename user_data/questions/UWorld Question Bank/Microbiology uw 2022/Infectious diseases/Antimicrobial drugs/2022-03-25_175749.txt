A novel aminoglycoside antibiotic is developed that is intravenously administered and excreted
unchanged in urine with an elimination half-life of 4 hours. Two different dosing regimens are
tested in a clinical trial: smaller doses given 3 times a day and a higher dose given once a

day. The total administered drug amount per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg/day) is

shown in the graph below:

[Blue: once-daily (extended interval) dosing, Green: multiple-daily dosing, MIC: minimum
inhibitory concentration]
