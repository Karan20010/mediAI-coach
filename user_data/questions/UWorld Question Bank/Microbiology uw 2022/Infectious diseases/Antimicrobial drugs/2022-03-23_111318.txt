ceftriaxone. Structural changes in penicillin-| BIRGIT) aETS that prevent ceftriaxone from
binding is one mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance.

(Choice A) Beta-lactamases function to degrade penicillin and cephalosporins. Production of
a beta-lactamase would prevent ceftriaxone from being able to bind to the penicillin-binding
proteins. Because ceftriaxone is so much smaller than the penicillin-binding proteins, unbound
ceftriaxone would likely accumulate at one of the electrodes. This would lead to no bands
being found within the electrophoresis area.

(Choice C) Asalvage metabolic pathway can restore metabolic function that would otherwise
be inhibited by an antibiotic such as trimethoprim or sulfamethoxazole.

(Choice D) Transmembranous efflux pumps confer resistance to antibiotics that require entry
into the cell to function (e.g., tetracyclines and macrolides). However, penicillins and
cephalosporins function outside of the bacterial cell at the peptidoglycan cell wall.

(Choice E) Upregulation of protein synthesis can occur to overcome the effect of an antibiotic
that binds to and irreversibly inhibits the action of that protein. However, if this were the
mechanism for resistance, five bands would still be identified on the radioautography test.
