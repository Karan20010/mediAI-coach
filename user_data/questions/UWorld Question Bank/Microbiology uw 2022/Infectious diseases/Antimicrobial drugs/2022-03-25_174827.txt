Acute simple cystitis often occurs in young, otherwise healthy women, particularly following
sexual intercourse. Common manifestations include dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, and
urinalysis evidence of pyuria/bacteriuria. Empiric treatment with nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim-

sulfamethoxazole is typically curative.
