Penicillins and cephalosporins function by irreversibly binding to penicillin-binding proteins.
Transpeptidases are one form of penicillin-binding protein that function to cross-link
peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. Inhibition of transpeptidase (which occurs with the use
of the cephalosporin ceftriaxone) leads to cell wall instability and bacteriolysis. Many bacterial
species synthesize multiple different penicillin-binding proteins; the laboratory study described
in this question stem identifies 5 such proteins that are produced by this isolate of
Streptococcus pneumoniae.
