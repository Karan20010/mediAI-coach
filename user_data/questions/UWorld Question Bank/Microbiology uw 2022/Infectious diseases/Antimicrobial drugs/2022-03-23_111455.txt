A 25-year-old man comes to the office due to 4 days of persistent diarrhea. He has a history
of HIV and is compliant with antiretroviral therapy. The diarrhea was initially watery but has
become bloody over the past day. A stool culture grows Shigella flexneri, which is resistant to
both azithromycin and fluoroquinolones. A recent study tracking resistance patterns in Shigella
species reveals rapid spread of resistance genes between different bacterial populations due
to the transfer of nonchromosomal DNA between adjacent bacteria via a small hair-like
appendage. Which of the following best describes the process by which the bacteria
responsible for this patient's infection likely developed resistance?

©) A. Conjugation
©) B. Transduction
©) C. Transformation
