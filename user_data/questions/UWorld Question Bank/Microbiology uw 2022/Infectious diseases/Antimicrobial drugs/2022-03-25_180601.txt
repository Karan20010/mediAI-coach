Educational objective:

Hyperkalemia is a common adverse effect of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole due to the
trimethoprim-induced blockade of the sodium channels in the collecting duct, which prevents
sodium-potassium exchange and reduces renal excretion of potassium (similar to the action of
amiloride). This effect is often magnified in the elderly population, those with renal failure, or
those given other potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor

blockers.
