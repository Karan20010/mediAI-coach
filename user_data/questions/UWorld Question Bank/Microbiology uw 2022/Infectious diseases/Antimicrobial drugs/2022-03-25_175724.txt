The drug described in this study demonstrates significant antiviral activity (cytopathic effect)
against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV 1), HSV 2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV) but has
weak activity against Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV). This agent is most
likely acyclovir, a guanosine analog. Once acyclovir enters the HSV-infected host cell, it is
phosphorylated to acyclovir monophosphate, principally via a virally-encoded thymidine
kinase (TK). This is the rate-limiting step in acyclovir activation. Acyclovir monophosphate is
then phosphorylated by cellular enzymes into the active triphosphate form, which impairs viral
DNA polymerase-mediated replication of HSV.

EBV and CMV do not produce the same TK as HSV and VZV. As a result, EBV- or CMV-
infected cells cannot easily convert acyclovir into its pharmacologically active form. At very
high intracellular concentrations of acyclovir, some of the drug appears to be activated by
unidentified cellular phosphorylating enzymes, which may explain the partial susceptibility of
EBV and CMV to higher acyclovir doses. The partial activity of acyclovir against CMV may
also be mediated by inhibited synthesis of a virus-specific polypeptide.
