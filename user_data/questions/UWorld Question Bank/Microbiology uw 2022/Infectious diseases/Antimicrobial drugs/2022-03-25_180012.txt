(Choice A) Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that binds ergosterol in the fungal cell
membrane, leading to pore formation and cell lysis.

(Choice B) 1,3-beta-D-glucan is a major polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall.
Caspofungin and the other echinocandin antifungals block glucan synthesis.

(Choice C) Flucytosine inhibits the synthesis of both DNA (replication) and RNA (protein
synthesis) in fungal cells. It is mainly used as a synergistic agent with amphotericin B. This
drug combination is particularly important in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

(Choice D) Griseofulvin, a P450 inducer, enters fungal cells and binds microtubules, inhibiting

mitosis.

Educational objective:
Azoles inhibit the synthesis of ergosterol by the fungal cytochrome P450 enzymes. They also
suppress the human P450 system, resulting in many drug-drug interactions.
