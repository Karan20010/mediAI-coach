4 synthesis, including fosfomycin, vancomycin, penicillins, and cephalosporins (eg,
- cefuroxime).
z (Choices A and C) Azithromycin and chloramphenicol inhibit the bacterial 50S ribosomal
9 subunit. They have no effect on the cell wall and would not alter bacterial shape in different
s osmotic gradients. Side effects of chloramphenicol include dose-related myelosuppression
and aplastic anemia.

» 13
14 (Choice D) Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) inhibit bacterial DNA topoisomerase and
= gyrase, which results in bacterial cell death due to DNA damage. They do not affect the cell
17 wall.

(Choice E) Doxycycline disrupts bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the bacterial 30S
ribosomal subunit. It has no effect on the rigidity of the cell wall.

Educational objective:

The bacterial cell wall protects the organism from osmotic stress. Antibiotics that target the
cell wall result in bacterial lysis in hypotonic solutions. Fosfomycin, vancomycin, penicillins,
and cephalosporins all disrupt bacterial cell wall synthesis.
