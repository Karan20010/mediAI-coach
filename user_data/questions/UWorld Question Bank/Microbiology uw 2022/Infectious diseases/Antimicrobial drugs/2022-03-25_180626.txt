Certain strains of bacteria produce the beta-lactamase enzyme, which hydrolyzes the beta-
lactam ring of penicillin family antibiotics rendering them ineffective. To help prevent this
effect, beta-lactamase inhibiting compounds have been developed. The beta-lactamase
inhibitors include clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam. Concurrent administration of a
beta-lactamase inhibitor with a beta-lactamase susceptible antibiotic allows that antibiotic to
retain its efficacy against the offending bacterium. For example, giving clavulanate together
with amoxicillin expands amoxicillin's spectrum of activity to include strains of beta-lactamase
synthesizing bacteria which would otherwise have been resistant to amoxicillin alone.
