This patient with enterococcal endocarditis likely received an aminoglycoside (AG) such as
gentamicin, a ribosome-targeting antibiotic. AGs are associated with ototoxicity (hearing
loss, tinnitus) and nephrotoxicity.

mRNA is translated into amino acids (AAs) and proteins on ribosomes.

¢ The small ribosomal subunit (30S in prokaryotes, 40S in eukaryotes) binds mRNA, which
contains genetic information serving as a reading frame, and tRNA, which serves as an AA
carrier

¢ The larger ribosomal subunit (50S in prokaryotes, 60S in eukaryotes) contains
peptidyltransferase, which catalyzes peptide bond formation between AAs
