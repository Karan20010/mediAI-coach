This patient has herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis, which can cause acute/subacute
changes in mental status, seizures, headache, and, in some cases, focal neurologic deficits.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis usually reveals a hemorrhagic lymphocytic pleocytosis
with increased protein and normal glucose. On neuroimaging, the classic finding includes the
presence of an abnormal MRI signal in the bilateral temporal lobes. The treatment for HSV
encephalitis is intravenous acyclovir, a nucleoside analog that, once activated, competes with
deoxyguanosine triphosphate for viral DNA polymerase; when acyclovir triphosphate
becomes incorporated into the replicating viral DNA chain, viral DNA synthesis is terminated.

Viral proteases are responsible for cleavage of protein precursors necessary for the production
of infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are important in the treatment of HIV and
hepatitis C (Choice F). Viral RNase H (removes the RNA primer, allowing for completion of
newly synthesized DNA) and viral reverse transcriptase (generates complementary DNA from
an RNA template) are important pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of retroviruses such
as HIV (Choices G and H).
