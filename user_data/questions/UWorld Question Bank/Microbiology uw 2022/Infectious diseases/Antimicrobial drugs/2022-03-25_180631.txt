synthesizing bacteria which would otherwise have been resistant to amoxicillin alone.
(Choice A) Clavulanic acid has negligible intrinsic antibacterial activity.
(Choice B) Immune cells do not produce beta-lactamases.

(Choice D) Clavulanic acid has no effect on the biotransformation of amoxicillin in the liver.
Moreover amoxicillin undergoes enterohepatic recirculation and is excreted primarily in
unchanged form in the urine.

(Choice E) Probenecid is a compound that decreases the renal clearance of penicillins by
inhibiting the tubular organic acid secretion system. This agent has been utilized to prolong
the action of penicillin in some settings.

Educational Objective:

Clavulanic acid, sulbactam and tazobactam are beta-lactamase inhibitors. Concurrent
administration of clavulanate with amoxicillin expands amoxicillin's spectrum of activity to
include strains of B-lactamase synthesizing bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin alone.
