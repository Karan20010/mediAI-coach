This patient has a pruritic, erythematous rash affecting the feet. Microscopy of skin scrapings
shows branching hyphae, confirming the diagnosis of tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Tinea pedis
is a superficial infection of the epidermis caused by dermatophytes, especially Trichophyton
rubrum and similar species. The organisms are widespread and are often acquired following
exposure to public places while barefoot (eg, athletic facilities, swimming pools). They can
also spread from other areas (eg, groin [tinea cruris], body [tinea corporis]) on the same
patient via autoinoculation.

Tinea pedis most commonly occurs between the toes (interdigital pattern) but in chronic cases
can cause a hyperkeratotic rash extending up the sides of the feet (moccasin pattern). Tinea
pedis is treated with a variety of topical antifungals, including azoles (eg, miconazole,
clotrimazole), allylamines (eg, terbinafine), and tolnaftate. However, nystatin (primarily used
for Candida infections) is not effective against dermatophytes (Choice D).
