(Choices A, D, and E) Cephalosporins (eg, ceftazidime), carbapenems (eg, imipenem), and
penicillins (eg, piperacillin) are beta-lactam drugs that exert their effect by interfering with the
cell wall. Resistance to cephalosporins and penicillins occurs largely because of the bacterial
secretion of beta-lactamase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes the beta-lactam ring and inactivates
the antibiotic. Carbapenems are not very susceptible to most beta-lactamases due to
additional chemical components surrounding their beta-lactam ring; however, resistance to
carbapenems can occur due to carbapenemase, which is primarily seen in Enterobacter
species.

(Choice B) Fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) block enzymes (DNA gyrase, topoisomerase)
responsible for bacterial DNA synthesis. Resistance usually occurs due to genetic mutations
that prevent drug binding to these enzymes or to the increased expression of antibiotic efflux
pumps.

Educational objective:

Aminoglycoside (eg, gentamicin) resistance is most commonly due to antibiotic-modifying
enzymes. These enzymes add chemical groups to the antibiotic, which diminishes its ability to
bind to the 16S ribosomal RNA within the 30s ribosomal subunit.
