Azoles are antifungal medications that inhibit the demethylation of lanosterol into ergosterol in
fungal cells. They exert their antifungal effects by suppressing synthesis of ergosterol, an
essential component of the fungal cell membrane. However, azoles also inhibit the activity of
the human P450 cytochrome oxidase system. This property leads to multiple drug-drug
interactions.

All azoles (eg, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) increase the serum
concentrations of drugs metabolized by liver P450 enzymes. This means that, when used
concomitantly with azoles, drugs metabolized by the liver P450 system may have increased
toxicity. For this reason, medications such as warfarin, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, and oral
hypoglycemics should be avoided (or have their use carefully monitored) in patients who are
receiving azole therapy.

Cytochrome oxidase inducers (eg, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital)
increase azole metabolism, thereby lowering azole concentration in serum.
