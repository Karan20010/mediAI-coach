This patient with latent tuberculosis infection (positive tuberculin skin test, no symptoms,
unremarkable chest x-ray) was started on isoniazid (INH) therapy and now has fever,
anorexia, and nausea. INH is directly hepatotoxic. In 10%-20% of patients, it causes acute,
mild hepatic dysfunction, characterized by transient increases in serum aminotransferases
(AST/SGOT, ALT/SGPT). This adverse effect usually occurs during the first 4-6 months of
treatment, and, in most cases, liver function tests return to baseline with continued INH
therapy. In rare instances (<1%), frank hepatitis (similar to viral hepatitis with fever, anorexia,
nausea, jaundice) can occur (as seen in this patient) and sometimes evolves into a severe
form with progressive liver dysfunction and death.
