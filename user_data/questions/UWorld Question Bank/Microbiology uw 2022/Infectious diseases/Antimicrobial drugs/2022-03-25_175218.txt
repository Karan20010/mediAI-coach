3 (Choice B) Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) is an allergic inflammation of the kidney that is
5 most commonly triggered by medications and is often associated with fever, rash, and
6 eosinophilia. However, acyclovir is not a common cause of AIN; common causes include
7
8 nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, penicillins, cephalosporins, diuretics, and allopurinol.

(Choice C) Monitoring of acyclovir blood levels is not always effective in preventing
re nephrotoxicity. During states of low intravascular volume (eg, dehydration), nephrotoxicity can
develop secondary to increased urinary concentration even when acyclovir blood levels are

14 not within the established toxic range.

16 (Choice D) Allopurinol blocks xanthine oxidase, which reduces the formation of uric acid.
Pretreatment with allopurinol is often used in patients with lymphoma and leukemia to prevent
urate crystal nephropathy due to tumor lysis syndrome. Acyclovir nephrotoxicity is mediated
by the formation of acyclovir crystals, not urate crystals, so allopurinol pretreatment would be

ineffective.

(Choice E) Pretreatment with prednisone can help prevent radiocontrast-induced allergic
reactions. Prednisone does not prevent the formation of acyclovir crystals.

Educational objective:
Intravenous acyclovir can cause crystalline nephropathy if adequate hydration is not also
