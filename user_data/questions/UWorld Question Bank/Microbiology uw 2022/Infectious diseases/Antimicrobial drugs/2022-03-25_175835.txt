The 2 major factors influencing the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents are the drug
concentration at the target site and the amount of time that microbes are exposed to the drug.
The relative contribution of these factors to drug efficacy depends on the particular agent. In
general, antibiotics can be classified into 2 categories based on which factor is more important:

Â¢ Concentration-dependent killing: Antibiotics with this pattern of activity (eg,
aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones) have a persistent, suppressive effect on bacterial
growth following a limited exposure, resulting in increased killing ability when drug levels at
the site of infection are maximized. The higher the peak drug level compared to the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the greater the antimicrobial activity. As such,
higher-dose, extended-interval (ie, once-daily) regimens are frequently used to optimize
bacterial killing.

Time-dependent killing: Antibiotics with this activity pattern (eg, beta-lactams [penicillins,
cephalosporins], clindamycin) have minimal persistent effects and are dependent on long
exposure durations for their antimicrobial activity. They are more effective when serum
concentrations exceed the MIC for a prolonged period. Therefore, more frequent,
multiple-daily dosing regimens are used to maintain plasma concentrations greater than
the MIC for as long as possible.
