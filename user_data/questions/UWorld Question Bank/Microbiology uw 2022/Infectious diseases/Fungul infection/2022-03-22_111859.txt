Educational objective:

Oral thrush is caused by Candida albicans infection and usually presents as white, plaque-like
oropharyngeal lesions that are easily scraped off with a tongue depressor. Affected patients
typically have disruption to local microbial flora (eg, antibiotic use) or impairment in cell-
mediated immunity (eg, corticosteroids, HIV). Young, otherwise healthy patients with thrush
should be tested for HIV.
