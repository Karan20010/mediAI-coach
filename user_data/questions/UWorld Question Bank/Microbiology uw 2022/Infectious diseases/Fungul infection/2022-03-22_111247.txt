In this case, the patient has a bloodstream infection with C albicans, a normal commensal of
the mouth, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although mucocutaneous Candida infections are
common in otherwise healthy individuals, invasive infection typically occurs only in those with
indwelling central catheters or significant neutropenia. Manifestations can include organ
abscesses (eg, kidney, heart, brain, eye, liver) and clusters of macular skin lesions.

Blood cultures will reveal smooth, creamy white, glistening colonies. Microscopic evaluation
will show small, ovoid budding yeasts. Pseudohyphae, an important diagnostic clue, form
when yeasts do not separate after budding, creating a sausage-like chain of elongated yeasts
joined together end-to-end with constrictions. Incubating the sample in human serum at 37 C
for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test) leads to the formation of true hyphae, projections from the
yeast with no constrictions. A positive germ tube test is diagnostic of C albicans and
distinguishes it from other Candida species (eg, C tropicalis, C glabrata).
