Amphotericin B is often administered intravenously. Its main toxicities include the following:

Â¢ Acute infusion-related reactions, such as fever, chills, rigors, and hypotension, can
occur. These are common and are seen most frequently during initial infusions (often
diminish with subsequent infusions). Premedication with antipyretics and antihistamines
can lessen the severity of these effects.

Dose-dependent nephrotoxicity can result from a drug-induced decrease in the
glomerular filtration rate. Permanent loss of renal function is thought to be related to the
cumulative total dose. Renal function (eg, creatinine) should be closely monitored in
patients undergoing treatment with amphotericin. Concomitant administration of other
nephrotoxic drugs (eg, aminoglycosides, cyclosporine) should be avoided.

Significant electrolyte abnormalities (hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia) can develop.
These effects occur in the majority of patients within the first week of therapy. Electrolytes
should be monitored daily and replaced as needed.

e Anemia occurs due to suppression of renal erythropoietin synthesis. This effect may be
severe in patients with HIV who are taking zidovudine (which also suppresses bone
marrow function).

Thrombophlebitis can be seen at the site of injection.
