causes difficulty eating. The patient has a history of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis and
has had recurrent Candida infections of the skin, oral mucosa, and nails since infancy. He is
currently on suppressive therapy with fluconazole, which has been successful in preventing
infections until this most recent episode. Physical examination shows extensive oral mucosal
candidiasis. Scrapings from a lesion are obtained for culture, and intravenous antifungal
therapy is initiated. Sensitivity testing of the colonies that grow in culture show Candida that is
resistant to fluconazole. Which of the following changes in the pathogen best explains this
patient's breakthrough infection?
