septate hyphae; yeasts are not seen.

(Choice C) Coccidioides immitis is a dimorphic fungus that grows in mold form when cultured
at 25 C (77 F). It appears as yeast (spherules containing endospores) at body temperature.
Coccidioides does not form germ tubes.

(Choice D) Cryptococcus neoformans, which grows as white mucoid colonies, also shows
budding yeast on microscopy. However, it does not form germ tubes or pseudohyphae. In
addition, special stains (eg, India ink) reveal a thick capsule.

(Choice E) Histoplasma capsulatum is a slow-growing, dimorphic fungus that grows in mold
form when cultured at 25 C. It appears as oval-shaped, budding yeasts at body temperature.
Histoplasma does not form germ tubes.

(Choice F) Rhizopus is a mold that grows as white, cotton-like colonies that turn gray-brown
over time. Microscopy reveals broad, nonseptate hyphae; yeasts are not seen.
