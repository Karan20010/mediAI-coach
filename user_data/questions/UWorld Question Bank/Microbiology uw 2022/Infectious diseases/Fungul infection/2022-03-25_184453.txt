Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal that treats yeast infections but has no activity against
molds. Itis a first-line therapy for Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans and offers
some efficacy against most other Candida species, as well as endemic fungi (eg, Histoplasma,

Coccidioides, Blastomyces).

Azole antifungals exert their effect by blocking lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, a
cytochrome p-450â€”dependent enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol. Because
ergosterol is a crucial component of the cell membrane of fungi, treatment with azole
antifungals causes fungal cell membrane weakening and subsequent cell lysis and death.
However, use of azole antifungals as long-term suppressive therapy or repeat use for recurrent
fungal infections can lead to resistance.
