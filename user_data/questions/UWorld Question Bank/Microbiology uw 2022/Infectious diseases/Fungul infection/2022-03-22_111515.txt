(Choices A and B) Malassezia furfur and Microsporum canis cause cutaneous mycoses but
do not affect the paranasal sinuses.

Now ep wile

(Choice D) Invasive aspergillosis involving the paranasal sinuses can show close clinical
resemblance to mucormycosis. However, light microscopy of the affected tissue will
differentiate these two diagnoses: unlike Mucor and Rhizopus, Aspergillus has septate hyphae
that branch at 45° angles (V-shaped branching).

(Choice E) Candida albicans can cause a variety of symptoms in immunosuppressed
patients. Right-sided endocarditis, renal abscesses, and esophagitis are among the most
common. Budding yeasts and pseudohyphae are seen on light microscopy.

(Choice F) Cryptococcus neoformans primarily causes meningoencephalitis (eg, headache,
confusion, altered mental state) in patients who are immunocompromised (particularly those
with advanced AIDS).

(Choices G, H, and I) Blastomyces, Histoplasma, and Coccidioides cause lung disease in
healthy patients. Disseminated disease occurs in immunosuppressed individuals. Isolated
paranasal involvement is not typical.

(Choice J) Sporothrix schenckii can be transmitted to humans via subcutaneous inoculation.
