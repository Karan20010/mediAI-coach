Sporotrichosis typically presents as papulonodular lesions distributed along the lymphatics and
is histologically characterized by granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation. It is caused by
the dimorphic fungus Sporothrix schenckii, which is often inoculated into the skin during

outdoor activities such as gardening.
