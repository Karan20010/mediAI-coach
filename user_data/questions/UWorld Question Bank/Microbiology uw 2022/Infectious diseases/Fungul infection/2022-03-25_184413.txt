(Choice B) Triazole antifungals (eg, fluconazole, itraconazole) inhibit cytochrome P450
enzymes, suppressing the metabolism of many other medications. This effect explains the
myriad drug interactions of this group of antifungal agents.

(Choice C) Binding of microtubular proteins is the mechanism of griseofulvin, which is
effective against dermatophytes only.

(Choices D and E) Amphotericin B does not interact with ribosomal subunits or mitochondrial
enzymes.

Educational objective:

Amphotericin B binds the ergosterol of fungal cell membranes to exert its antifungal effects.
However, it also binds cholesterol to some degree, causing toxicity to human tissues. The
most important adverse effects of amphotericin B are nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia, and
hypomagnesemia.
