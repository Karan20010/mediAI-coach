+ 3 (Choice A) Early complement proteins (eg, C3b, C5b) assist opsonization, and late

28 complement proteins (C5-C9) form the membrane attack complex. Complement is crucial for

control of bacterial infections, but it plays a minimal role in the control of Candida. In addition,
complement levels are not particularly diminished by chemotherapy.

(Choice B) Candida is primarily controlled by neutrophils, macrophages, and helper T cells;
immunoglobulins have more of an adjunctive role. In addition, immunoglobulin levels are not
typically affected by most cytotoxic chemotherapy because memory B cells are long lasting
and have low rates of cellular division.

(Choice C) Although chemotherapy impairs the production of granulocytes, which include
eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, transient reduction in eosinophil and basophil count
does not drastically increase risk of infection.

(Choice E) T lymphocytes (particularly Ty1 and T)17 subtypes) primarily prevent

superficial Candida infection by strengthening the mucosal immune defense; conditions that
impair cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous
Candida infection (eg, thrush, esophagitis). However, protection against invasive disease is

mediated primarily by neutrophils, not lymphocytes.
