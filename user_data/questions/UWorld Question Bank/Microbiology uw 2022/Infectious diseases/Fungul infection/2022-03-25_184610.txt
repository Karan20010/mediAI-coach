Patients with mucormycosis who respond to initial amphotericin therapy may be switched to
posaconazole. Liver function test monitoring is recommended in patients taking azoles.

(Choice A) Examples of drugs that can cause isolated thrombocytopenia include heparin,
beta-lactam antibiotics, and vancomycin.

(Choice B) Bisphosphonates (used for osteoporosis) affect bone metabolism and can cause
hypocalcemia. Foscarnet (used for treating ganciclovir-resistant cytomegalovirus infections)
also causes hypocalcemia.

(Choice C) Daptomycin can induce rhabdomyolysis, leading to elevated creatine
phosphokinase.

(Choice E) TSH monitoring is recommended for patients taking amiodarone (used for treating
arrhythmias) or lithium (used for treating bipolar disorder).

Educational objective:

Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal drug notorious for its renal toxicity. Severe
hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia are commonly seen during therapy and often require daily
supplementation.
