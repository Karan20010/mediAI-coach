(Choice A) Aspiration pneumonia is common in patients who have impaired levels of

to

consciousness. It usually presents with cough productive of foul-smelling sputum, dyspnea,
fever, and a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. Most cases are caused by a mixture of anaerobic
organisms.

(Choices B and E) Cigarette smoking impairs the ability of the cilia to clear mucus, which can
lead to recurrent bacterial pneumonia. Patients with splenectomy are at increased risk for
fulminant bacterial infections, particularly with encapsulated organisms such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae. Bacterial pneumonia usually presents with cough productive of sputum,
dyspnea, fever, and a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. The presence of diffuse interstitial
infiltrates and a positive silver stain make PCP more likely.

(Choice C) The humoral antibody response is important for the elimination of pathogenic
bacterial and viral infections. Although viral pneumonia can cause bilateral interstitial
infiltrates, viruses are not identified on silver stain.

Educational objective:

Pneumocystis pneumonia is an atypical fungal infection seen primarily in those with impaired
cell-mediated immunity (eg, advanced AIDS). Manifestations often include slowly worsening
pulmonary symptoms, hypoxia, and bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest x-ray. The cystic
