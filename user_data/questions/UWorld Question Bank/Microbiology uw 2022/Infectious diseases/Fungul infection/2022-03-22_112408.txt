(Choice B) Candida is another common fungal infection in patients with FN. However,
isolated respiratory infection due to Candida is very uncommon; candidemia typically

to

manifests with fever and other nonspecific findings, although erythematous skin nodules
develop in some patients.

(Choice C) Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast that most frequently causes opportunistic
infections in patients with immunosuppression, especially those with HIV/AIDS. The most
common presentation is meningoencephalitis.

(Choice D) Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is an important cause of severe respiratory
infection in immunocompromised patients. PCP can present with fever and cough, but chest
radiographs most commonly reveal diffuse, bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Pneumocystis
cannot be cultured but can be visualized microscopically in bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum,
and tissue specimens.

(Choice E) Rhizopus infection can lead to mucormycosis, which most commonly presents
with a sinus infection that spreads rapidly to involve the orbits and brain (classically seen in
patients with diabetes).
