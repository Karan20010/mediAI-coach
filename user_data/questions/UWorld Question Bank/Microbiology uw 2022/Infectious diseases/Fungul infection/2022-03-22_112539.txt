aspergillomas are asymptomatic, and the organism does not resemble a yeast in culture.

(Choice C) Candida infective endocarditis can cause pulmonary infection due to septic
pulmonary emboli. However, this condition is rare and is typically seen in patients with

(Choice D) Histoplasma capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that is inhaled as microconidia and
converts to a small, ovoid yeast in the lungs. It replicates by forming narrow-based buds, not
germ tubes. In addition, most clinically significant cases are associated with pneumonia, not
bronchitis.

(Choice E) Mycobacterium tuberculosis pulmonary infection is usually marked by months or
