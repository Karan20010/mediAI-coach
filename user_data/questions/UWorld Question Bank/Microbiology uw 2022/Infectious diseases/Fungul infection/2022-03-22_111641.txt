formation after surgery (eg, tooth extraction) or trauma.

(Choice B) Cutaneous leishmaniasis is histologically characterized by granulomatous
inflammation and intracellular amastigote organisms within macrophages. Although it may
present with ulcerated papules and nodules, cutaneous leishmaniasis is most frequently seen
in the Middle East and Central and South America; this patient lives in the southeastern United
States and has not traveled recently.

(Choice D) Spongiosis (ie, epidermal intercellular edema) and superficial dermal perivascular
inflammation are histologic features of acute eczematous dermatitis, such as allergic contact
dermatitis (eg, poison ivy). Clinical manifestations typically include erythematous, pruritic
papules and vesicles, rather than nodular lesions.

(Choice E) Prominent plasma cell infiltrates and obliterative endarteritis are characteristic of
syphilitic lesions. Depending on the stage of infection, cutaneous syphilitic lesions may
include painless ulcers (eg, chancre), gray-white plaques (eg, condylomata lata), a
maculopapular rash, and gummas.
