This patient with leukemia recently underwent chemotherapy (with likely myelosuppressive
effects) and now has a fungal respiratory infection with febrile neutropenia (FN), typically
defined as fever with an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm:. Patients with FN are at
increased risk for severe infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated. Gram-
positive bacteria are the most commonly identified pathogens in FN followed by gram-negative
organisms. However, patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia (several days) are at
especially high risk for fungal infections.

Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis presents with some combination of fever, chest pain,
cough, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Chest imaging can show diffuse consolidation, nodules, or
cavitary lesions. On light microscopy, Aspergillus is seen as septate narrow hyphae that
branch at a 45Â° angle. Antifungal therapy is needed.
