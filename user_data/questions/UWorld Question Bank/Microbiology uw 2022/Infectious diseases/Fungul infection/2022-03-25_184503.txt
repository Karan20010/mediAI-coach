Azole resistance is typically due to 21 of the following mechanisms:
¢ Mutations to the gene for 14-alpha-demethylase, which alters the enzyme shape or azole
binding site
¢ Increased expression of 14-alpha-demethylase, which increases the minimum inhibitory
concentration to prevent ergosterol synthesis

¢ Overexpression of drug efflux pumps, which reduces intracellular azole levels

Patients who develop azole resistance may require higher doses or treatment with an alternate
antifungal (eg, echinocandin).
