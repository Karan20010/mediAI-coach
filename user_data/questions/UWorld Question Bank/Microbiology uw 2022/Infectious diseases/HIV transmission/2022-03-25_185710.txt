(Choice A) Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular, gram-negative bacterium that can infect
the columnar epithelium of the cervix (eg, cervicitis) and urethra, in addition to the lungs and
eyes. Diagnosis is with nucleic acid amplification testing, and treatment is with azithromycin, a

bacteriostatic macrolide antibiotic.

(Choice B) Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a gram-negative diplococcus that infects the genital

u mucosa (eg, cervicitis, urethritis) and is diagnosed with gram stain of discharge or nucleic acid
amplification testing. It is treated with ceftriaxone (a third-generation cephalosporin that

14 inhibits cell wall biosynthesis) monotherapy in the setting of negative testing for Chlamydia,
and ceftriaxone plus doxycycline when Chlamydia coinfection is present.

(Choice D) Vulvovaginal candidiasis is typically due to Candida albicans, which causes
vaginal pruritus, labial erythema, and a white, curd-like discharge. KOH examination shows
yeast forms and pseudohyphae. Treatment is with azole antifungals (eg, fluconazole), which
block ergosterol synthesis.

(Choice E) Syphilis causes a painless chancre (not vaginal discharge), followed by a rash
and systemic symptoms; it is caused by the gram-negative spirochete Treponema pallidum. It
is treated with penicillin, a bactericidal beta-lactam antibiotic that inhibits cell wall synthesis.
