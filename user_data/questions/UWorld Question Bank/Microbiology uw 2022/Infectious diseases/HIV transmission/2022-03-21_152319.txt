asymptomatic incubation period (lasting an average of 6-8 weeks) followed by acute disease
lasting several weeks to months. HBsAg first appears before the onset of symptoms, peaks
when the patient is most ill, and then becomes undetectable in 3-6 months (unless the disease
progresses to a chronic phase). Shortly after HBsAg first appears, HBeAg and HBV DNA can
be detected in the serum and are markers of active viral replication. Anti-HBcAg IgM and
elevated serum transaminases appear shortly before symptom onset. Over the next few
months, the anti-HBcAg IgM component is replaced with an IgG component. Anti-HBeAg
appears shortly after HBeAg vanishes and suggests subsiding viral activity (transition from
high viral replication/infectivity to low viral replication/infectivity). Anti-HBsAg IgG arises once
the acute disease has resolved (unless the disease progresses to a chronic phase), and is
typically not detectable until weeks or months after HBsAg has disappeared. This antibody
may persist indefinitely, conferring lifelong immunity.

Given this serologic marker graph, it appears that this patient has a persistence of HBsAg and
HBeAg over a long period with low to moderate levels of anti-HBcAg IgG and no detectable
Anti-HBsAg. These findings are suggestive of an acute hepatitis B infection that has not
resolved, but rather has progressed to a highly infectious chronic hepatitis B (note the
persistence of HBeAg and lack of anti-HBeAg).
