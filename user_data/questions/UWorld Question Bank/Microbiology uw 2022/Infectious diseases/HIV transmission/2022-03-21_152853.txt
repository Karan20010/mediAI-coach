The clinical presentation of syphilis occurs in well-defined stages:

¢ Primary syphilis manifests as a painless ulceration with raised, indurated borders. This
chancre develops at the Treponema pallidum inoculation site (most commonly penis or
vulva) 1-3 weeks after contact and resolves in 3-6 weeks. The organism commonly
disseminates systemically during this stage.

¢ Secondary syphilis, a bacteremic stage that develops 5-10 weeks following chancre
resolution, presents with a diffuse macular rash, as shown in the exhibit, encompassing
the palms and soles. Condylomata lata, large gray wartlike growths typically appearing in
the genital/perineal region, are another typical manifestation.

¢ Latent syphilis is an asymptomatic period divided into early latent (infection within past
year) and late latent (infection >1 year ago).
