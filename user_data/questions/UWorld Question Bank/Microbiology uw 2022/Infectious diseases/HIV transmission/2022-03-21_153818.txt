(Choice B) Interferon-a is used for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, condyloma
acuminata, hepatitis B virus infection, and Kaposi sarcoma.

(Choices C, D, F, and G) There are no vaccines currently available to prevent HIV. Infants
whose mothers are HBsAg-positive should receive the hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin
within hours of birth to prevent perinatal transmission. There is no effective prevention for
mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis C.

(Choice E) Folic acid in prenatal vitamins (PNVs) can help prevent neural tube defects. Other
important PNV components include iron (for hemoglobin synthesis), calcium (for bone growth),
and iodine (for thyroid function). PNV intake does not prevent vertical transmission of HIV.
