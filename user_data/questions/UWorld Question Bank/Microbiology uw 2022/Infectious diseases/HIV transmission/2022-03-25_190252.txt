Educational objective:

Tertiary syphilis can result in thoracic aortic aneurysm. If the aneurysm compresses adjacent
structures and dilates the aortic valve ring, a murmur and mediastinal widening might be
present. The pathogenesis begins with vasa vasorum endarteritis and obliteration, resulting in
inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the aortic adventitia. Fluorescent treponemal
antibody absorption testing is specific for syphilis.
