Patients with herpes simplex virus (HSV) usually have symptoms that flare and remit in a
cyclical fashion. Initial HSV infections are marked by viral replication at the site of exposure
(eg, perioral or genital skin), which leads to vesicular mucocutaneous lesions and flulike
symptoms. Manifestations last a week or two and then resolve spontaneously when viral
replication ceases. However, the virus also spreads to dermal nerve terminals and is
transported in a retrograde fashion to the sensory ganglia, where it establishes a lifelong
latent infection within the neuronal cell bodies.

During latent infection, no viral replication occurs, so the disease is asymptomatic. However,
infected cells continue to produce some HSV genes (eg, latency-associated transcript gene),
and stress and other triggers can reactivate viral replication and lead to the re-emergence of
symptoms (eg, vesicular lesions on the oral/genital mucous membranes, low-grade fever,
malaise). Recurrent symptoms last a week or two and then resolve; they are often less severe
than the initial episode.
