(Choice A) Protease inhibitors (eg, atazanavir, indinavir, darunavir) inhibit HIV protease from
cleaving HIV polyproteins into the individual, functional proteins that compose the virus. This
results in the formation of immature, noninfectious virions that are unable to infect T cells or

macrophages.

(Choices B and F) Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (eg, efavirenz, nevirapine)
allosterically bind reverse transcriptase, which alters its shape and prevents it from converting
the HIV RNA genome into complementary DNA (cDNA). Nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (eg, tenofovir, emtricitabine) competitively bind reverse transcriptase and are
integrated into growing cDNA strands, which results in chain termination. Both of these HIV
medication classes truncate viral replication but do not affect viral attachment or fusion.

(Choice C) Enfuvirtide is an HIV fusion inhibitor that binds to the HIV transmembrane surface
protein glycoprotein 41 and prevents the virus from fusing with the host cell membrane.
Fusion inhibitors would inhibit the ability of HIV to invade both lymphocytes and macrophages.

(Choice E) Integrase inhibitors (eg, raltegravir, dolutegravir) prevent the HIV enzyme
integrase from incorporating viral CDNA into the host chromosome, which prevents viral
replication. They do not affect viral attachment or fusion.
