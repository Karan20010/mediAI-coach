HIV reverse transcriptase does not have a proofreading mechanism. This allows the virus to
rapidly accumulate mutations (~1 nucleotide base pair per replication cycle) that may make it
resistant to antiretroviral monotherapy. However, the consistent use of combination
antiretroviral therapy, which contains medications that target multiple steps in the HIV
replication cycle, effectively prevents the development of resistant strains.

This patient was found to have a large number of viral isolates with new mutations to the pol
gene, which encodes for the major HIV enzymes protease, reverse transcriptase, and
integrase. Most first-line antiretroviral medications, including protease inhibitors, reverse
transcriptase inhibitors, and integrase strand transfer inhibitors, target these enzymes. The
emergence of a new predominant strain with mutation to the po/ gene suggests that this
patient has become resistant to his antiretroviral therapy. Nearly all cases of acquired
antiretroviral resistance are due to inconsistent use (transmitted resistance can also occur
when an individual is inoculated with a resistant strain). This patient will likely need a new
antiretroviral regimen and should be encouraged to take it as prescribed.
