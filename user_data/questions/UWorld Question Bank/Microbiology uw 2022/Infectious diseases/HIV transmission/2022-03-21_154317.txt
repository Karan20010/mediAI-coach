(Choice A) False-positive HIV serology can be seen in the setting of cross-reacting antibodies
due to pregnancy, rheumatic disease, and malignancy. Although patients with cross-reacting
antibodies have negative plasma HIV RNA, they would not have low CD4 counts or an AIDS-
defining defining illness (eg, esophageal thrush).

(Choice B) HIV attacks host cells by binding to the host CD4 receptor and CCR5 (or CXCR4)
chemokine coreceptor. Homozygous deletion to CCR5 usually prevents HIV infection because
the virus is not able to enter host cells; these individuals would not typically develop low CD4
count or signs of AIDS.

(Choice C) X4 strains of HIV-1 use the chemokine receptor CXCR4 as a coreceptor during
viral entry into host cells. Patients who are infected with X4 strains have positive plasma HIV-1
RNA.

(Choice E) The window period occurs during early HIV infection when serologic testing and
antigen testing for HIV are not yet positive. This patient had positive HIV antigen/antibody
testing; therefore, she is not in the window period.
