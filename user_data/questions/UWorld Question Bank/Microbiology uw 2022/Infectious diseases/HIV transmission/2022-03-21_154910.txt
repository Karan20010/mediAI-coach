This patient has infectious urethritis and epididymitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis. C
trachomatis urethral infections are often asymptomatic but patients may develop dysuria and
scant, watery discharge; deeper spread to the epididymis is typically marked by scrotal pain
with tenderness along the posterior aspect of the testis.

Laboratory results in patients with infectious urethritis due to C trachomatis are as follows:

e Pyuria: Urine dipstick testing will show positive leukocyte esterase, and urine Gram stain
will reveal 210 white blood cells/hpf (Choice E).

Poor Gram staining: Gram stain of urethral swab can quickly diagnose Neisseria
gonorrhoeae infection (intracellular gram-negative diplococci); however, organisms will
not be seen in the setting of C trachomatis or Mycoplasma genitalium infection because
these pathogens do not have sufficient peptidoglycan in their cell wall to pick up Gram
stain.

Negative urine culture: Because C trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen, it
cannot be grown on traditional culture medium; therefore, urine and genital swab cultures
will be negative.
