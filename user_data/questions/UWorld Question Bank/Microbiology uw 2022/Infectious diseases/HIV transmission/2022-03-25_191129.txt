(Choices A and E) Zidovudine and emtricitabine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NRTIs). In general, NRTIs must be converted into their monophosphate forms by a
cellular kinase (cellular thymidine kinase) before they can be converted into pharmacologically
active triphosphate forms.

(Choice B) Enfuvirtide is an HIV fusion inhibitor that binds to HIV envelope gp41 and blocks
the conformational changes necessary for the fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Through
this mechanism, enfuvirtide denies the HIV genome entry into uninfected CD4- T-cells. Its

main site of action is outside the cytoplasm.

(Choice D) Ritonavir is an inhibitor of HIV protease that prevents assembly and maturation of
the virus. Nonfunctional, noninfectious virions are produced instead. Reverse transcription is
not affected.

Educational objective:
Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are antiretroviral drugs that do not

require activation via intracellular phosphorylation. The more common NNRTIs include
nevirapine and efavirenz.
