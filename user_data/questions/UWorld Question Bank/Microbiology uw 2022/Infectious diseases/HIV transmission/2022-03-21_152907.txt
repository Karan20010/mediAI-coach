Â¢ Late (tertiary) syphilis develops many years after infection in untreated individuals.
Gummas are characteristic and often begin as painless, indurated granulomatous lesions
that progress to white-gray rubbery lesions that may ulcerate. They are most commonly
cutaneous but also appear in the subcutaneous tissue, bones, liver, and other organs.
Tertiary syphilis can also manifest as cardiovascular involvement with ascending aortic
aneurysms (with calcification seen on x-ray) and resultant aortic valve insufficiency
(murmur, high-pitched tambour S2).

Neurosyphilis, which may be asymptomatic or cause subacute meningoencephalitis, tabes
dorsalis, or other neurologic sequelae, is a common manifestation of late syphilis but can
occur at any stage.
