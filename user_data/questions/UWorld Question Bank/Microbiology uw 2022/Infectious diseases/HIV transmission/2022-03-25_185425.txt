Serological markers for HBV can be used to distinguish between acute infection, chronic
infection, and a protective vaccination response. Acute HBV infection is marked by the
proliferation of the virus in hepatocytes with the release of viral antigens (HBsAg, HBeAg) and
HBV DNA into the bloodstream and the generation of IgM against HB core antigen. Many
patients with acute infection will have subclinical, anicteric disease, but approximately 30%
develop several weeks or months of jaundice, fatigue, hepatomegaly, and elevated

transaminases.

Most adults with HBV clear the virus and generate protective immunity against future
infection. This is reflected serologically by the following progression:

1. Anti-HBe antibodies develop 3-6 months after initial infection and are associated with the
elimination of HBeAg. This correlates with reduced viral replication and infectivity.

2. HBsAg is eliminated around the time that HBeAg becomes undetectable.

3. Anti-HBsAg antibodies form several weeks/months later and provide protective
immunity against future infection.
