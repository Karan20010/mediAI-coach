Tat | Promotes transcription of viral genes

Rev | Enhances export of unspliced viral transcripts from nucleus to cytoplasm
Nef | Downregulates host CD4 & MHC | proteins (inhibits immune recognition)
Vpu | Aids viral assembly & release

Vpr | Facilitates nuclear entry & inhibits host cell division

Vif | Increases infectivity & viral yield
