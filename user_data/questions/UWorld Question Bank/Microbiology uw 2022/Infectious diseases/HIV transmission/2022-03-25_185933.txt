The HIV genome encodes several enzymes and structural proteins in polycistronic mRNAs
that are then translated into polyproteins and cleaved by proteases into the individual proteins
that compose the virus. The env gene encodes the polyprotein gp160, which is extensively
glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi body and subsequently cleaved into the
mature envelope proteins gp120 and gp41. These envelope proteins remain associated by
noncovalent attachments and form the glycoprotein spikes that pepper the surface of the
HIV virus.

gp120 forms the outside surface of the glycoprotein spike and mediates viral attachment to
the host cell by binding with the CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor (CXCR4, CCRS5)
(Choice A). Binding of gp120 to these host receptors induces a conformational change in the
structure of the glycoprotein spike that exposes the underlying transmembrane glycoprotein
gp41. gp41 mediates fusion of the viral cell membrane with the host cell membrane, thereby
allowing the viral core to enter the cell.

Drugs that selectively bind gp41 (eg, enfuvirtide) are known as fusion inhibitors because
they prevent gp41 from undergoing the conformational changes necessary for viral fusion,
which prevents the HIV genome from entering uninfected cells.
