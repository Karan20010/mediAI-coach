Microscopy of this patient's penis ulcer reveals a multinucleated giant cell with ground-glass
intranuclear inclusions, raising strong suspicion for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection.
Genital HSV is usually caused by HSV type 2, which is spread primarily via direct skin contact
with herpetic sores or infected genital secretions during sexual activity. Initial infection is often
characterized by painful genital ulcers, fever, lymphadenopathy, and dysuria. Symptoms
typically resolve within a few weeks, but latent infection develops in the sacral dorsal root
ganglia and can periodically reactivate, leading to recurrence.

HSV is generally diagnosed by cell culture or PCR, but Tzanck smear (as seen above) can
reveal the cytopathic effects of the virus (eg, multinucleated giant cells, acantholytic cells,
keratinocyte ballooning, nuclear molding). Oral antiviral agents such as acyclovir, a
competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, help soeed symptom resolution.
