Disseminated gonococcal infection occurs when Neisseria gonorrhoeae spreads from the
genitourinary tract to the bloodstream. It typically presents with the triad of polyarthralgia,
tenosynovitis, and dermatitis (painless pustules on the extremities) or purulent arthritis. The
diagnosis is confirmed when the organism is isolated on Thayer-Martin media, chocolate agar
infused with antibiotics.

N gonorrhoeae is spread primarily via infected genital secretions during sexual contact.
Therefore, most cases can be prevented by the consistent use of condoms, which act as a
mucosal barrier between sexual partners. Patients with genitourinary N gonorrhoeae
infections may have purulent cervicitis or urethritis, but many are asymptomatic.
Asymptomatic infection increases the risk of spread to deeper tissues (eg, disseminated
gonococcal infection, pelvic inflammatory disease) because of treatment delay.
