Initial HIV infection is often associated with mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever,
lymphadenopathy, sore throat) 2-4 weeks after transmission. Important diagnostic clues are
oropharyngeal ulcers and a diffuse maculopapular rash. As the humoral antibody response is
not fully activated early in infection, laboratory results typically show HIV in the serum (positive

viral load and p24 antigen) but negative HIV serology.
