Educational objective:

IgA protease is produced by Neisseria meningitidis, N gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae. This enzyme cleaves secretory IgA at its hinge
region, rendering it ineffective. Secretory IgA exists on mucosal surfaces and in secretions
and acts to bind and inhibit the action of pili as well as other cell surface antigens that normally
mediate mucosal adherence and subsequent penetration.
