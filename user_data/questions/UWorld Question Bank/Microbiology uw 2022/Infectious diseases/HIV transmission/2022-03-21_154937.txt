(Choice A) Positive urine white blood cell, Gram stain, and urine culture results are typical of
a urinary tract infection caused by Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. However,
obligate intracellular parasites such as C trachomatis are not seen on Gram stain or easily
cultured.

(Choice B) Patients with N gonorrhoeae infection usually have pyuria, but have a negative
urine culture because a specialized medium (eg, Thayer-Martin agar) is typically required to
grow the organism. Gram stain of urethral discharge would show gram-negative intracellular
diplococci.

(Choice D) Positive urine Gram stain and culture with no pyuria may be seen in some
patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria, a typically benign condition except in select situations
(eg, pregnancy).
