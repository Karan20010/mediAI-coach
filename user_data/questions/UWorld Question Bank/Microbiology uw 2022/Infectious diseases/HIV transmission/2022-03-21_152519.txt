(Choice B) Most DNA viruses are double-stranded. They are enveloped (ie, surrounded by a
lipid layer) or non-enveloped (ie, lacking a surrounding lipid layer). Adenovirus is a non-
enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that typically causes self-limited upper respiratory
infection or gastroenteritis.

(Choice C) Parvovirus is a single-stranded, non-enveloped DNA virus that causes erythema
infectiosum, or fifth disease. Patients classically present with fever, cough, and rhinorrhea
followed by a "slapped-cheek" and lacy, reticular truncal rash.

(Choice D) Rotavirus, a type of reovirus, is a double-stranded, positive-sense, non-enveloped
RNA virus. Rotavirus infection is a vaccine-preventable disease characterized by profuse,
watery diarrhea in children.

(Choices E and F) Most RNA viruses are single-stranded and can be classified as negative-
or positive-sense viruses. Positive-sense viruses can be directly translated into proteins, but
negative-sense stranded viruses must first have their RNA converted into positive-sense
strands before translation. Coxsackievirus, a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus of the
enterovirus family, causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, which presents with vesicular
lesions on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and soft palate. The gums and hard palate are usually
involved in HSV gingivostomatitis, not hand-foot-mouth disease.
