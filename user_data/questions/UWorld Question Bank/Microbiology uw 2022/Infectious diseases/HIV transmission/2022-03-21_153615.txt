Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts [AGW)) are characterized by pink or skin-colored
plaques, papules, and verrucous lesions on the genitalia, perineum, or perianal skin. AGW are
caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), primarily types 6 and 11. The diagnosis is usually
apparent on clinical examination, but biopsy is often helpful for large or atypical lesions.
Histopathologic features include papillary architecture with thickening of the stratum
corneum (hyperkeratosis), epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis), nuclear irregularity, and
perinuclear vacuolization (koilocytosis).

AGW are associated with an increased risk for HIV infection. AGW and HIV share common
tisk factors; both are frequently acquired via sexual contact and have an increased prevalence
in men who have sex with men. In addition, patients with immune suppression (eg, transplant
immunosuppression, HIV infection) have increased incidence of AGW and frequently have
multiple, widespread lesions. Conversely, large, friable AGW lesions likely confer increased
susceptibility to acquiring HIV infection. Therefore, HIV testing is recommended.
