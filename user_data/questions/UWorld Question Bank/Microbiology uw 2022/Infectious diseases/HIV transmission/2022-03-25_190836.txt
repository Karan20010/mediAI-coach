(Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by autoantibodies against epithelial cell
surface antigens, leading to the formation of mucous membrane blisters that quickly erode;
histopathology usually shows acantholysis (detached keratinocytes) with superficial dermal
infiltrate.

(Choice B) Kaposi sarcoma (KS) lesions are histologically characterized by spindle-shaped
endothelial cells that form vascular channels. KS is due to human herpesvirus 8 infection and
most commonly occurs in the setting of advanced AIDS. Lesions typically appear as purplish
or dark brown plaques and nodules on the lower extremities.

(Choice D) Biopsy of erythema nodosum lesions usually reveals septal panniculitis with
multinucleated giant cells. Erythema nodosum is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that
can occur due to drugs or other antigenic stimuli. Patients usually present with tender nodules
on the bilateral shins.

(Choice E) Biopsy of anogenital warts will demonstrate papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia
with cytoplasmic vacuolization. Anogenital warts are caused by specific serotypes of human
papillomavirus (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11). Anogenital warts are not typically associated with diffuse
maculopapular rash or systemic symptoms.
