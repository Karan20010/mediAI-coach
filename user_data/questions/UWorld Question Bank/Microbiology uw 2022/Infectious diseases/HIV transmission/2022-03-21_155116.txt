This patient most likely has a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV classically presents
with multiple, painful genital ulcers with a characteristic erythematous base, dysuria (likely
due to irritation of the ulcers), tender bilateral lymphadenopathy (common with primary
genital HSV infection), and systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache) in the setting of a new
sexual partner.

The appearance of genital HSV lesions can vary and mimic other disease processes as the
lesions change from vesicles to ulcers. Therefore, a suspected clinical diagnosis of genital
HSV requires laboratory confirmation via PCR, viral culture (low sensitivity, particularly as
lesions heal), direct fluorescence antibody testing, or Tzanck smear (showing multinucleated
giant cells).
