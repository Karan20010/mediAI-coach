: : (Choice A) The alveoli are comprised of simple squamous epithelium. This thin and flat
+ 6 epithelium facilitates rapid transmembrane exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
. 7
- 8 (Choice B) The false vocal cords, also known as ventricular folds, are folds of mucous
membrane lined in respiratory epithelium, which is ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and
+ it mucus-secreting. The false vocal cords are adjacent to the true vocal cords and help to
: Qe lubricate the true vocal cords with mucus and protect the airway from foreign bodies.
: (Choices C and D) The paranasal sinuses and trachea also are lined in respiratory
16 epithelium. This ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and mucus-secreting epithelium protects

the respiratory tract from debris and pathogens. Goblet cells secrete mucus to trap particulate
matter, and the cilia beat in a rhythmic fashion to propel this mucus/debris toward the oral

cavity, where it can be swallowed or coughed up.

Educational objective:

Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a small DNA virus with a tropism for stratified squamous
epithelium, which protectively lines anatomical areas that undergo frequent friction and
abrasion, including the true vocal cords, cervix, and anus. Infants can acquire respiratory
papillomatosis via passage through an HPV-infected birth canal.
