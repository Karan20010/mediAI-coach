Tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is a common component of HIV
therapy. This drug is generally well tolerated but may occasionally cause damage to the
proximal tubule of the kidney, leading to acute kidney injury and/or proximal tubule impairment
(eg, phosphoruria, glucosuria, proteinuria, water retention). Biopsy typically reveals a normal
glomerulus and renal interstitium but damage to the proximal tubule.
