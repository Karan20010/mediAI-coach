This patient with dysuria and penile discharge likely has infectious urethritis due to sexually
transmitted infection. Most cases are caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia
trachomatis, or Mycoplasma genitalium. The underlying pathogen is typically identified with
nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of urine, vaginal, or endocervical swab. However,
light microscopy with Gram stain can be performed to rapidly identify N gonorrhoeae while
awaiting NAAT results, as follows:

¢ Gonococcal urethritis: leukocytes with intracellular gram-negative diplococci

¢ Nongonococcal urethritis: leukocytes with no visible organisms; because Chlamydia
and Mycoplasma do not have sufficient peptidoglycan in the cell wall to take up Gram
stain, they cannot be ruled in or out with microscopy

Patients with gonococcal urethritis who have coinfection with C trachomatis or uncertain C
trachomatis status (as in this patient whose NAAT results are pending) require a third-
generation cephalosporin (eg, ceftriaxone) and a tetracycline (eg, doxycycline) to cover
gonococcus and possible C trachomatis coinfection. Patients with gonococcal urethritis who
have negative C trachomatis NAAT should be treated with third-generation cephalosporin (eg,
ceftriaxone) alone (Choice F). Patients with nongonococcal urethritis should be treated with
macrolide (eg, azithromycin) or tetracycline (eg, doxycycline) monotherapy (Choice C).
