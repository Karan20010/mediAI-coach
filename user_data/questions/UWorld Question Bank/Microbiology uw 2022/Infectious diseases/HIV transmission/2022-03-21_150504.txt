A 45-year-old man comes to the office with groin pain and swelling. About a month ago, he
noticed a sore on his penis but did not seek medical attention because the ulcer was not
painful and disappeared within a week. Several days ago, he began to experience painful
swelling in his inguinal region, with inflammation of the overlying skin and eventual formation of
several draining ulcers. He also has mild fever and malaise that began around the same time

as his groin symptoms. The patient is a sailor. His other medical problems include well-
controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Cell scrapings from his lesions show cytoplasmic
inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
