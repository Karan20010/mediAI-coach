Researchers develop a novel drug to treat HIV infection. In an in vitro experiment, wild-type
viral isolates are cultured with human CD4 T lymphocytes in the presence of the drug.
Microscopic evaluation of these cells reveals no cytopathic changes, and no intracellular viral
particles can be detected. Further analysis reveals that in the presence of the drug the virus
attaches to the cellular membrane, but fusion of the viral and cell membranes does not occur.
