Educational objective:

Most cases of AIDS worldwide are caused by HIV-1. However, AIDS can also be caused by
infection with HIV-2, which is endemic to West Africa. HIV-2 infection is associated with lower
viral loads, less risk of transmission, and a slower progression to AIDS. The diagnosis is often
suspected when HIV tests are incongruent (positive screening serology but indeterminate
Western blot and negative plasma HIV-1 RNA). Confirmation can be made using HIV-1/HIV-2

immunodifferentiation assay.
