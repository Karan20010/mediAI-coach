(Choice B) Azithromycin can be used to treat chancroid, which is characterized by the

formation of a papule that evolves into a pustule and then an ulcer. However, it is very rare in

the United States and is caused by the gram-negative organism Haemophilus ducreyi;

multinucleated giant cells would not be seen.

(Choice C) Doxycycline can treat lymphogranuloma venereum, a genital infection caused by
certain serotypes of Chlamydia trachomatis. This disease is marked by the formation of a
small genital ulcer, followed by significant lymph node inflammation and pain in the inguinal or
femoral region. C trachomatis appears as intravacuolar organisms in macrophages.

(Choice D) Fluconazole can treat Candida balanitis, which is typically marked by a painful,
pruritic, erythematous rash. Yeasts and pseudohyphae can often be seen on microscopy.

(Choice E) Penicillin can be used to treat syphilis, a spirochetal infection caused by
Treponema pallidium that begins with the formation of a chancre (painless ulcer with heaped-
up borders and a clean base) at the site of inoculation. Diagnosis is generally made with
serologic testing because T pallidium cannot be cultured; multiple ulcers and multinucleated

giant cells are not typically seen.

(Choice F) Permethrin can be used to treat pubic lice, which are associated with significant

pruritus of hairy genital areas. Lice can generally be visualized on the hair shaft.
