(Choice B) Viral assembly and budding occur at the cell surface. The envelope proteins

a8 (gp120, gp41) are expressed on the cell surface and then a complex of the nucleocapsid, viral

: z RNA, and viral proteins (gag and pol polyproteins) bud from the surface. Further assembly

“9 then occurs when the virus is free from the host cell. The transmembrane gp41 does not

“a catalyze the budding or assembly process.

(Choice C) Protease is an HIV enzyme that mediates the cleavage of HIV polyproteins into
14 the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus. Protease inhibitors (eg, atazanavir,

16 darunavir) block the action of this enzyme.

(Choice E) Integrase inserts the viral double-stranded DNA into the host genome. Integrase

inhibitors (eg, raltegravir, dolutegravir) are often part of first-line therapy for HIV.

(Choice F) Reverse transcriptase converts viral single-stranded RNA into complementary
double-stranded DNA. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors terminate viral DNA elongation by
competitive or allosteric inhibition.

(Choice G) Host RNA polymerase II transcribes proviral DNA into mRNA, which is then
translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
