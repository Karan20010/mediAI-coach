Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) used in the treatment of
HIV/AIDS. Allergic responses can occur with many HIV/AIDS medications. Abacavir
hypersensitivity reaction (AHR) is an allergic reaction that develops in 2%â€”8% of patients
and is strongly associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)
system. AHR occurs due to direct binding of abacavir to a segment on the HLA-B*57:01
molecule, which alters the presentation of self-peptides to the immune system and results in a
delayed hypersensitivity reaction (type IV). Manifestations are mediated by a cytotoxic T-
cell response and typically include fever, malaise, gastrointestinal symptoms, and a delayed
rash. Abacavir discontinuation results in rapid improvement. A negative test for the HLA-
B*57:01 allele has almost a 100% negative predictive value for AHR. Therefore, genetic
testing is usually done prior to administering the medication.
