This patient's verrucous, skin-colored genital lesion is most consistent with condylomata
acuminatum, also known as anogenital warts. Condylomata acuminatum is caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV), a small double-stranded DNA virus with >100 subtypes. HPV is the
most common sexually transmitted disease and can be transmitted by vaginal, anal, and oral
intercourse. Most infections are cleared by host immunity, but types 6 and 11 can result in
warts.

HPV infects basal epithelial cells through small breaks in the skin or mucosal surfaces. It has
a predilection for stratified squamous epithelium, which is found in the anal canal, vagina,
and cervix. In the respiratory tract, the true vocal cords are the only area covered with
stratified squamous epithelium. The vocal cords undergo near-constant friction and abrasion
to produce speech. Stratified squamous epithelium is protective, as deeper cells can replace
surface cells that are damaged.

Infants can acquire respiratory papillomatosis via passage through the birth canal of mothers
infected with the virus. Warty growths on the true vocal cords can lead to a weak cry,
hoarseness, and stridor.
