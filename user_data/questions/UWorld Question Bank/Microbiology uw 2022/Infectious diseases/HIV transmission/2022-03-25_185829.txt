(Choice A) HIV is typically treated with reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors.
Although acute HIV infection often presents with rash, lymphadenopathy, and constitutional
symptoms a few weeks after transmission, a spiral-shaped organism would not be seen on
biopsy.

(Choice B) Phenytoin can cause a diffuse rash due to a delayed type IV hypersensitivity
reaction. However, most cases arise within a few weeks of initiating therapy, not 6 years later.
In addition, a corkscrew-shaped organism would not be seen on biopsy.

(Choice C) Fluroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) disrupt bacterial DNA synthesis by blocking
bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase. Fluroquinolones are often used for gram-negative
bacterial infections (eg, urinary tract infection) but not for syphilis.

(Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole disrupts bacterial folate metabolism by blocking
enzymes that generate dihydrofolic and tetrahydrofolic acid. This agent is often used for
urinary tract and skin/soft tissue infection but is not used for syphilis.

Educational objective:
Syphilis is caused by the corkscrew-shaped organism Treponema pallidum. Secondary
syphilis develops in untreated patients weeks or months after the initial infection, and presents

with a diffuse, macular rash and generalized lymphadenopathy. First-line treatment is
