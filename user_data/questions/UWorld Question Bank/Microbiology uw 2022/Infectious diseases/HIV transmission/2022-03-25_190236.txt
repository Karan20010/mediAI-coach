This patient's murmur is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, which, in the presence of
mediastinal widening, suggests an aortic aneurysm that has dilated the aortic annulus. The
positive serology for syphilis (positive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption [FTA-ABS]
test) suggests a "luetic" aneurysm, consistent with tertiary syphilis.

Tertiary syphilis begins with vasa vasorum endarteritis and obliteration, resulting in
inflammation, ischemia, and weakening of the adventitia. Aneurysmal dilation of the thoracic
aorta results and can extend to involve the aortic valve ring. Syphilitic aneurysms are
uncommon in the United States.
