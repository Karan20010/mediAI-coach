(Choice A) L serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis cause lymphogranuloma venereum.
Although initial infection is associated with a painless genital ulcer, patients primarily present
after the disease has spread to the regional lymph nodes, which results in painful
lymphadenitis. This disease is very rare in the United States and occurs mostly in tropical and

subtropical regions.

(Choice B) Haemophilus ducreyi is a small gram-negative rod that causes chancroid, a
sexually transmitted infection characterized by painful (not painless) genital ulcers with an
erythematous base. Lesions typically begin as papules or pustules and evolve into an ulcer.
More than one lesion is often present.

(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus usually causes multiple, bilateral, painful, ulcerating lesions.
Initial infections are frequently associated with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, headache,
myalgia) and tender lymphadenopathy.

(Choice D) Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus, is a leading cause of
cervicitis, urethritis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. Infected patients usually have copious
purulent discharge from the urethra; ulcerative genital lesions are not a feature of this

organism.
