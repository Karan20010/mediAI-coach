B*57:01 allele has almost a 100% negative THES value for AHR. Therefore, genetic
testing is usually done prior to administering the medication.

(Choice B) Common side effects of protease inhibitors such as darunavir include metabolic
abnormalities (hyperglycemia), gastrointestinal symptoms, and lipodystrophy.

(Choices C and E) The non-NRTIs efavirenz and nevirapine may cause Stevens-Johnson
syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, but these conditions are not associated with HLA
alleles. Liver function abnormalities can also occur with these 2 non-NRTIs.

(Choice D) Emtricitabine, another NRTI, has been associated with an asymptomatic macular

rash on the palms or soles; no genetic basis for this reaction has been identified.

Educational objective:
Abacavir hypersensitivity reaction occurs in 2%—8% of patients and is strongly associated with
the HLA-B*57:01 allele.
