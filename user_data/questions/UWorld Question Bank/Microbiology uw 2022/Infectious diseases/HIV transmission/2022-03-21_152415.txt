(Choice A) Adenoviruses can cause severe upper respiratory illnesses, pneumonia, and
disseminated infection in immunosuppressed patients.
(Choices B and E) HIV-positive patients often experience reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) infection. EBV replication in such patients is associated with certain lymphomas

and with oral hairy leukoplakia, which typically manifests as white plaques on the lateral
tongue margins (this patient's white buccal plaques on initial diagnosis were more likely thrush
due to Candida).

(Choice C) Chlamydia trachomatis causes lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), characterized
by an ulcerative or vesicular lesion on the external genitalia followed by significant regional
lymphadenopathy. Proctitis with tenesmus and bloody discharge can be seen with both LGV
and anal carcinoma; however, LGV has a less indolent clinical course, and painful
lymphadenopathy is a cardinal feature.

(Choice D) HIV-positive patients with CD4+ cell counts <100/mm: are at significantly
increased risk of developing cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, which most frequently causes
retinitis in AIDS patients. CMV involvement of the gastrointestinal tract typically manifests as
esophageal ulcers or colitis, not anal masses.
