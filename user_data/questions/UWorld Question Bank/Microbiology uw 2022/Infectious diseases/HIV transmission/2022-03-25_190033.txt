Worldwide, those countries with high rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have more than
85% of all hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases. Korea, Taiwan, Mozambique, and China
experience the highest annual rates of HCC (36 per 100,000 versus <5 per 100,000 in North
America). The individuals who develop HCC in these countries usually have chronic HBV
infection acquired through vertical transmission at childbirth, which increases their risk of
developing HCC by early to middle adulthood 200-fold. In the United States, HCC normally
arises after the age of 60. In these countries with high rates of HBV infection, however, HCC
commonly presents in adults 20 to 40 years old.

Therefore, universal vaccination of children against HBV would be the one measure most likely
to cause a steep decline in the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.
