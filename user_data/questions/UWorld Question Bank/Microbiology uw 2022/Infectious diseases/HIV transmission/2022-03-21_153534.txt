(Choices B and D) D-glutamic acid-D-glutamic acid and L-alanine-D-glutamine are not
sequences targeted by transpeptidase. Penicillin is not a structural analog of either molecule.
(Choice C) Sulfonamide antibiotics are antimetabolites that compete with para-aminobenzoic

acid for incorporation into folic acid. Trimethoprim blocks another step in folic acid synthesis
by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase.

(Choices E and F) Peptidoglycan precursor molecules consist of a disaccharide composed of
N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) and N-acetylglucosamine (GIcNAc).
