This patient has bacterial vaginosis (BV), an alteration in the normal vaginal flora associated
with loss of lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobes, particularly the gram-variable rod
Gardnerella vaginalis. Although BV is not a sexually transmitted infection, it is associated
with sexual activity (due to alterations of the vaginal flora from semen or contraceptives [eg,
spermicide]).

Patients with BV commonly have a thin, gray or clear malodorous vaginal discharge. The
discharge's odor becomes more prominent when potassium hydroxide (KOH) is added toa
sample (whiff test) because of the volatilization of amines produced by G vaginalis and other
anaerobes. Clue cells on wet mount microscopy are also characteristic.

Clindamycin and metronidazole are effective treatments for BV. Clindamycin is a
bacteriostatic drug that inhibits protein translation by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit.
Metronidazole is bactericidal and damages the DNA of anaerobes; it is typically avoided with
concurrent use of alcohol due to a disulfiram-like reaction (eg, vomiting, flushing).
