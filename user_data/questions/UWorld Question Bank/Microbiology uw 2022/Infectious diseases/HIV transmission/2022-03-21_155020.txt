(Choice A) Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia
burgdorferi. Early localized Lyme disease can be associated with arthralgias, myalgias, fever,
and erythema migrans (a migrating, erythematous, bull's-eye rash). However, it is not
associated with tendonitis/pustules, and spirochetes cannot be cultured on Thayer-Martin
media.

(Choice B) N gonorrhoeae undergoes dramatic antigenic variation of its surface molecules,
which prevents the formation of protective antibodies against future infection. Therefore,
recurrent infection is common and vaccinations are ineffective.

(Choice C) The roundworm Trichinella can be transmitted via undercooked pork. It invades
the skeletal muscle and causes severe muscle pain, swelling, and tenderness. Periorbital
edema and eosinophilia are often important diagnostic clues. Diagnosis is made by serology;
culture on Thayer-Martin media is not performed.

(Choice E) Dengue fever, also called breakbone fever, is a mosquito-borne viral infection
associated with fever, severe myalgias, arthralgias, and macular rash. Hemorrhagic
complications can occur. The diagnosis is usually made clinically; Thayer-Martin media would
not yield an organism (as it is a viral pathogen).
