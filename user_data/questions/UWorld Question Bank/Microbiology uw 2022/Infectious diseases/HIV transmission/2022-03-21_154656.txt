The HIV genome contains a set of structural genes (gag, pol, and env) that encode
polyproteins. These polyproteins are subsequently cleaved by host or viral proteases into the
individual proteins that compose the HIV virus.

The only glycosylated HIV polyprotein is gp160, the product of the env gene. gp160 is
extensively glycosylated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. It is then
cleaved into the envelope proteins gp120, which mediates viral attachment, and gp41, which
mediates viral fusion with the host cell. Glycosylation of these proteins is crucial for:

¢ Immune evasion — Glycosylation acts as a shield for the conserved regions of these
surface proteins, masking them from immune recognition.

¢ Host cell binding

¢ Proper protein folding
