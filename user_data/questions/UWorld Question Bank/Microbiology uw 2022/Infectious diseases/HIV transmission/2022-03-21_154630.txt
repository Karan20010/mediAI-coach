: A scientist is conducting research to discover novel drug targets for antiretroviral agents
6 against HIV. An HIV-positive blood sample is analyzed in the laboratory, and purified CD4 T
z lymphocytes are extracted. Using molecular tracing techniques, the scientist follows a viral
9 HIV protein that is synthesized in the blood sample's T cells. The protein becomes
s glycosylated before being proteolytically cleaved into 2 smaller proteins in the Golgi
12 apparatus. Which of the following best describes the function of these 2 newly formed HIV
13 : 2
a proteins?
is
16 ©) A. Viral DNA integration into the host genome
