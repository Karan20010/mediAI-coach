Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor (Pl). These drugs reversibly inhibit viral protease, an
enzyme responsible for HIV polyprotein cleavage to form mature viral proteins. Pls are never
used as monotherapy as viral resistance to the entire class can form quickly. The following
important adverse effects can be seen with Pls:

1. Lipodystrophy leads to increased fat deposition on the back and abdomen and
decreased adipose tissue on the face, extremities, and buttocks. This gives patients a
"buffalo hump" appearance with central obesity and peripheral wasting.

2. Hyperglycemia results from increased insulin resistance and may lead to diabetes.

3. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 may cause interactions with other drugs. Rifampin
increases P450 activity and will therefore decrease PI serum levels; as a result, rifampin
can be replaced with rifabutin in the treatment of tuberculosis in patients on Pls.
