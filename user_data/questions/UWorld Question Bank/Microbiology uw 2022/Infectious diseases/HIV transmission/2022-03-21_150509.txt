A 45-year-old man comes to the office with groin pain and swelling. About a month ago, he

noticed a sore on his penis but did not seek medical attention because the ulcer was not

painful and disappeared within a week. Several days ago, he began to experience painful

swelling in his inguinal region, with inflammation of the overlying skin and eventual formation of

several draining ulcers. He also has mild fever and malaise that began around the same time

as his groin symptoms. The patient is a sailor. His other medical problems include well-

controlled hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Cell scrapings from his lesions show cytoplasmic

inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

JY A. Chlamydia trachomatis (42%)

B. Haemophilus ducreyi (12%)
C. Herpes simplex virus (9%)
D. Klebsiella granulomatis (6%)

E. Treponema pallidum (28%)
