The above image depicts a Tzanck smear, in which epithelial cells are scraped from an ulcer
base and stained. The presence of multinucleated giant cells is suggestive of herpes
simplex virus (HSV) infection, which is consistent with this child's symptoms. Tzanck smears
are insensitive and do not differentiate between HSV and varicella-zoster virus infection.
Therefore, Tzanck smears largely have been replaced by polymerase chain reaction testing.

Primary infection with HSV-1 results in herpetic gingivostomatitis. Peak age for primary
infection is age 6 months to 5 years. Prodromal symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, chills) begin
approximately 1 week after contact with an infected person (who is generally asymptomatic).
Painful vesicles appear, extensively covering the lips and gingiva, and may include the palate,
tongue, or oropharynx. The vesicles organize into extensive ulcers and resolve within 1-2
weeks. The pain of gingivostomatitis often results in dehydration, the most common reason

for hospitalization.
