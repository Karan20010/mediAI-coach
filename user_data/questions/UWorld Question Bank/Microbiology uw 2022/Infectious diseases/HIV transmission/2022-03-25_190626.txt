macrolide (eg, azithromycin) or tetracycline (eg, doxycycline) monotherapy (Choice C).

(Choices A and B) N gonorrhoeae is largely resistant to fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin,
levofloxacin), so this class of medication is not recommended.

(Choice D) Penicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis. However, empiric treatment is not
recommended unless a chancre is present. Other stages of syphilis should only be treated
when serology (eg, rapid plasma reagin, VDRL) is positive or the organism is otherwise
identified.

Educational objective:

Infectious urethritis in men is typically caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia
trachomatis, or Mycoplasma genitalium. Diagnosis is generally made by nucleic acid
amplification testing, but microscopy with Gram stain can be used to quickly diagnose
gonococcal infection. Patients with gonorrhea and positive or uncertain Chlamydia status
require ceftriaxone and doxycycline; ceftriaxone alone can be used in those who do not have
Chlamydia coinfection.
