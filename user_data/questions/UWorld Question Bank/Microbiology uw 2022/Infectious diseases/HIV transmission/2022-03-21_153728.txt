(Choice B) IgAis a weak activator of the classic complement pathway. Impairment of
complement-mediated cell lysis can be accomplished by staphylococcal protein A, which binds
the Fc portion of IgG, preventing complement fixation.

(Choice C) Although IgA Fc-mediated functions such as opsonization are compromised by
IgA protease, secretory IgA is a poor opsonin. Impairment of opsonization and phagocytosis is
most frequently accomplished by encapsulated bacteria such as S pneumoniae, N
meningitidis, and H influenzae.

(Choice D) IgA does not play a role in the induction of memory lymphocytes necessary for
mounting a secondary immune response (which requires the formation of memory B and T
lymphocytes after initial antigen exposure).

(Choice E) Promotion of intracellular survival is accomplished by inhibition of phagosome-
lysosome fusion or resistance to lysosomal enzymes. These properties are expressed by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M leprae, Legionella, and Ehrlichia.
