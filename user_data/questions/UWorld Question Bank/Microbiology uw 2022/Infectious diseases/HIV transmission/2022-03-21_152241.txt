(Choice A) Infection with hepatitis B or C virus usually results in chronic hepatocyte infection
and persistent viral replication. Patients are usually asymptomatic for years or decades and
then eventually develop cirrhosis and related complications (eg, jaundice, ascites,
encephalopathy). Latent infections do not occur.

(Choice C) Epstein-Barr virus has a tropism for B-lymphocytes. Initial infection is associated
with infectious mononucleosis (eg, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, malaise, atypical
lymphocytosis); latent infection is usually asymptomatic, but there is a small risk of B-cell or
Hodgkin lymphoma due to malignant transformation. Both Epstein-Barr virus and herpes
simplex virus are members of the Herpesviridae family.

(Choice D) Hepatitis D virus is a small RNA molecule that requires coinfection with hepatitis B
virus to have complete viral assembly. Superinfection by hepatitis D virus in patients with
hepatitis B virus can lead to acute hepatic failure.

(Choice E) Influenza has a segmented genome, which leads to high rates of gene
reassortment when 2 strains infect the same cell. Gene reassortment of surface glycoproteins
(eg, hemagglutinin, neuraminidase) causes new strains to emerge and can result in new
infections in those with a history of previous influenza infection; because surface proteins have
changed, previous immunity is insufficient.
