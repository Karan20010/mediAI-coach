This patient has a severe headache, nausea, and an elevated eosinophil count in the
cerebrospinal fluid, indicating eosinophilic meningitis, a condition most often caused by
Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection. Humans are incidental hosts and typically acquire
the helminth by eating contaminated mollusks or snails while in Southeast Asia or the Pacific
Islands. Eosinophilic meningitis can also be caused by other helminths (eg, Gnathostoma,
Baylisascaris) or, less commonly, by fungi (eg, coccidioidomycosis), leukoproliferative
disorders (eg, Hodgkin lymphoma), or an adverse drug reaction.

Eosinophils are of the granulocyte lineage (along with basophils and neutrophils), and the
majority of total body eosinophils are in tissue (eg, spleen, lymph nodes, thymus, digestive
tract). However, polyclonal expansion of peripheral eosinophils can occur due to release of
IL-5 by T,,2 lymphocytes and innate lymphoid cells in response to helminth infection,
allergens, drugs, or rheumatic disease; IL-5 may also be constitutively expressed by solid
organ malignancies.
