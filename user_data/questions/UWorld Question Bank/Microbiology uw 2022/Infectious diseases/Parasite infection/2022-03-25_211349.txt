A 37-year-old woman comes to the office due to right-sided abdominal discomfort that has

been getting progressively worse over the past few weeks. She has not had any nausea or
vomiting. The patient's family moved to the United States from rural Kazakhstan when she
was a child. The patient has no drug allergies. She does not use tobacco or alcohol. She has
a dog at home. Temperature is 36.7 C (98.1 F). Physical examination is notable for
hepatomegaly. Ultrasound reveals a large liver mass with cystic lesions. During surgery to
resect the mass, the patient suffers from a procedural complication and dies. At the family's
request, an autopsy is performed. A cut section of a portion of the mass is shown in the image
below.
