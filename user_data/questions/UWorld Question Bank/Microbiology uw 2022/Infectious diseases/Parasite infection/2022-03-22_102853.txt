Although fever and fatigue are nonspecific symptoms, this patient's peripheral blood smear is
diagnostic of malaria, a disease endemic to Africa and Latin America that is caused by 4 main
species of Plasmodium. The diagnosis is frequently made by examination of a peripheral
blood smear with Giemsa staining. In Plasmodium falciparum infection, red blood cells have
multiple small rings representing developing trophozoites (arrows) and banana-shaped
gametocytes (not shown).

For malaria acquired in areas known to have chloroquine-sensitive organisms, chloroquine is
the treatment of choice. Many African species are chloroquine-resistant; these can be
treated with atovaquone-proguanil or artemisinins, which are well tolerated and have
excellent cure rates. P vivax and P ovale have dormant liver forms (hypnozoites) that require
the addition of primaquine therapy.
