(Choice A) Treponema pallidum has an affinity for the aortic wall and can cause ascending
aortic aneurysms (syphilitic aortitis) in patients with tertiary syphilis. Diagnosis is made with
serology; treponemes are not visible on standard microscopy.

(Choice B) Neurocysticercosis, which is caused by the larval stage of the pork tapeworm
Taneia solium, is characterized by the formation of multiple calcified brain lesions that may
result in seizures and/or focal neurologic signs several years after transmission. Diagnosis is
made with imaging and serology, not blood microscopy.

(Choice D) Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Early
localized disease is characterized by a migrating erythematous, bull's-eye rash (erythema
migrans) and nonspecific symptoms. Months or years later, patients can develop late
manifestations, such as large joint arthritis or Lyme encephalopathy. B burgdorferi is a
spirochete and cannot be seen on standard blood microscopy.

(Choice E) Schistosomiasis is transmitted to humans who swim or bathe in fresh water
contaminated with cercariae from infected snails. The fluke matures in the liver and spreads to
the mesenteric vessels, where it releases eggs that can cause end-organ inflammation and
fibrosis (eg, periportal liver fibrosis). Diagnosis is made by identifying eggs in urine or stool,
not on blood microscopy.
