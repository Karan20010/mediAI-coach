Histopathology of this cystic brain lesion shows an invaginated scolex, the anterior portion of a
tapeworm. The scolex has refractile hooklets and suckers, which allow attachment to host
tissue. These findings are consistent with neurocysticercosis (NCC).

NCC occurs after humans ingest Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) eggs in contaminated food
or water. The eggs hatch into embryos, invade the intestinal mucosal border, and lodge in
tissue (eg, brain, muscle, eye), where they form cysts with larvae. When the cystic lesions
degenerate months or years later, it can cause inflammation and edema of the surrounding
tissue, leading to symptomatic disease. The most common manifestation is adult-onset
seizures due to intraparenchymal brain lesions.

Although the diagnosis is usually made based on neuroimaging findings (eg, 21 cystic lesion)
and serology, brain biopsy is sometimes performed due to concern for malignancy.
