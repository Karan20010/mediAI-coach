(Choices B and F) Dengue virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitos, and Plasmodium
falciparum is transmitted by Anopheles mosquitos. Dengue fever and malaria may present as
acute febrile illnesses, but both infections occur mainly in tropical regions. Malaria is
characterized by intravascular hemolysis, anemia, and abnormal liver function tests (similar to
babesiosis), but the blood smear frequently shows ring-shaped (not cross-shaped) erythrocyte
inclusions.

(Choices C and E) Asplenic patients are at increased risk for life-threatening infections with
encapsulated organisms (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria
meningitidis) and therefore receive protective vaccines. Intraerythrocytic inclusions are also
not seen in H influenzae and N meningitidis infections.

(Choice D) Histoplasmosis is a common mycotic infection that is most commonly found in the
Ohio and Mississippi river basins and is associated with activities involving exposure to bird or
bat droppings (eg, caving).
