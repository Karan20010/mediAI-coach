This patient has meningeal signs, confusion, and trophozoites in her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
raising strong suspicion for primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM is caused by
Naegleria fowleri, a free-living, motile, protozoan parasite that lives in warm water and soil
worldwide. Exposure primarily occurs when humans inadvertently inhale the organism during
recreational water activities such as swimming, diving, or using hot springs. Most
individuals do not become ill, but a minority develop fatal meningoencephalitis after N fowleri
penetrates the olfactory mucosa, crosses the cribriform plate, and invades the olfactory bulb.

Patients with PAM usually develop acute confusion, high fever, photophobia, and meningeal
symptoms (eg, neck stiffness, headache). Lumbar puncture opening pressures are often
markedly elevated, and CSF analysis typically reveals neutrophilic pleocytosis, high protein,
and low glucose. Suspicion is usually raised when CSF testing is negative for bacterial, viral,
or fungal pathogens. The diagnosis is confirmed when wet mount of the CSF reveals motile
trophozoites. Antibiotics (eg, amphotericin B) are often administered, but PAM is almost

always fatal.
