This patient with fever, icterus, splenomegaly, and ring-shaped parasites within red blood cells
has malaria, which is caused by 4 main species of Plasmodium (P falciparum, P vivax, P
ovale, P knowles/). Although malaria has been eradicated from the United States, cases still
arise due to travel to endemic regions, particularly when no chemoprophylaxis is taken.

The parasite is transmitted by female Anopheles mosquitos during blood feeding, travels to the
liver where it infects hepatocytes, and then subsequently undergoes asexual reproduction,
which generates hepatic schizonts with thousands of daughter cells (merozoites). Rupture of
the schizont into the circulatory system leads to erythrocyte infection and cycles of
intraerythrocytic reproduction.

As the parasite disseminates throughout the circulation, production of inflammatory cytokines
causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever, malaise, headache) and, sometimes, life-
threatening complications (eg, seizure, renal failure, circulatory collapse).
Hepatosplenomegaly and signs of anemia and hyperbilirubinemia (eg, scleral icterus) are often
present. The diagnosis is confirmed when peripheral blood microscopy shows
intraerythrocytic trophozoites with a "diamond ring" appearance.
