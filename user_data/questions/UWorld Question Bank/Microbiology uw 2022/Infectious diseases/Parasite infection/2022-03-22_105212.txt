A 5-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother due to 2 weeks of anorexia, nausea,
epigastric discomfort, and loose bowel movements. She has had no fever or bloody stools.
The patient recently returned from rural Brazil, where she spent the summer with family. She
had no gastrointestinal symptoms during the trip but developed intensely pruritic eruptions
between the toes of her right foot. The skin rash spontaneously resolved within a few days
and was attributed to insect bites from walking barefoot in the fields. The patient has no prior
medical conditions, takes no medications, and has received all age-appropriate vaccinations.
On physical examination, the abdomen is soft and nontender with normoactive bowel sounds.
Stool microscopy reveals smooth, thin-walled eggs. If left untreated, this patient's condition
can lead to which of the following complications?

A. Chronic lymphedema (8%)
B. Dilated cardiomyopathy (11%)
C. Granulomatous endophthalmitis (5%)

YD. Microcytic anemia (53%)
