This patient has fever, chills, sweats, and red blood cell inclusions on Giemsa smear that
developed following travel to a tropical geographic region (areas including South America,
Africa, India, and Southeast Asia). Together, these findings support a diagnosis of malaria.
Fever and sweating that occur every 48 hours (tertian malaria) are especially characteristic of
Plasmodium vivax, P ovale, or P falciparum infection.

All species of malaria-causing organisms share a similar life cycle. Organisms are first
inoculated into the human host by the Anopheles mosquito and then travel to the liver, where
they infect hepatocytes and replicate. Lysis of infected hepatocytes releases merozoites into
the bloodstream. Merozoites go on to infect erythrocytes, and it is the resultant erythrocyte
lysis that causes relapsing fevers and sweating. P vivax and P ovale are unique in that they
also establish a latent hepatic infection (exo-erythrocytic cycle) in the form of hypnozoites,
responsible for relapses.

Chloroquine is effective in eradicating chloroquine-sensitive plasmodia from the bloodstream,
but it has no activity against the latent hepatic infections established by P vivax and P ovale.
Primaquine must be added to the regimen to completely eradicate the hypnozoites.
