The clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis result from a T,2-mediated granulomatous
response directed against the eggs that is composed of infiltrating T.2 cells, eosinophils, and
M2 macrophages. This ultimately leads to the development of marked fibrosis and ulceration
and scarring of the bowel or bladder/ureters (depending on the species). Eggs that settle
into the presinusoidal radicals of the portal vein can cause periportal "pipestem" fibrosis
(pathognomonic for hepatic schistosomiasis).
