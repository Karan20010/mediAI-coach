Although many patients with hookworm infection are asymptomatic for months or years, some
individuals develop transient pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) during pulmonary migration or
gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) during gastrointestinal migration.
Diagnosis is generally made when smooth, thin-walled hookworm eggs are identified by stool
microscopy. Peripheral eosinophilia is also an important diagnostic clue.
