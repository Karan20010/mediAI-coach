Human hookworm infection is caused by Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale.
These pathogens are called hookworms because the head of the worm is often curved away
from the body, giving the organism a "hooked" appearance. Most cases occur in tropical and
subtropical regions where sanitation is poor. Transmission occurs when egg-containing
human feces is deposited into shady, warm, moist soil, which allows the eggs to hatch into
larvae. Spread occurs when larvae come into direct contact with human skin (eg, when

walking barefoot).

Dermal penetration often results in a transient, pruritic, maculopapular or serpiginous rash at
the entry site. The larvae then spread through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they
rupture into the alveoli and are subsequently coughed up and swallowed. In the small
intestine, the larvae mature into adults, attach to the gastrointestinal mucosa, and feed on
human blood by lacerating capillaries. Because these organisms can live in the
gastrointestinal tract for up to 14 years, total blood loss can be substantial. Therefore, the
biggest risk of hookworm infection is iron-deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) due to

chronic blood loss.
