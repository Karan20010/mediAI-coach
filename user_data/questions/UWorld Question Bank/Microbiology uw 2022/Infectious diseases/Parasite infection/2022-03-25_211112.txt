Educational objective:

Schistosomiasis is a blood fluke infection that occurs when humans bathe or swim in
freshwater that contains contaminated snails. Adult worms mature in the liver, lodge in the
mesenteric venules or vesicular venous plexus, and secrete eggs into feces or urine. Eggs
can trigger granulomatous inflammation, leading to symptoms in the gastrointestinal, urinary,
or periportal tract. Diagnosis is typically made when round or oval eggs with a terminal or
lateral spine are identified in urine, feces, or biopsy.
