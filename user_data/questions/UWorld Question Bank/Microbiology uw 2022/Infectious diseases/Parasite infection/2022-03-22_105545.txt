Cryptosporidiosis

Pathogenesis

Fecal-oral transmission (eg, contaminated water, animal contact)
Oocyte ingestion — sporozoite attachment to intestinal epithelium
— intraluminal meront formation — fecal oocyte shedding

Clinical
manifestations

Immunocompetent: self-resolving, watery (noninflammatory)
diarrhea <2 weeks

Immunosuppressed (eg, AIDS, transplant recipient): prolonged,
severe diarrhea with weight loss/malabsorption

Diagnosis

Stool PCR testing
Stool microscopy: acid-fast staining oocysts or
immunofluorescent assay

¢ Histology: basophilic Cryptosporidium organisms on intestinal

brush border, small intestine villous blunting, lamina propria
inflammation
