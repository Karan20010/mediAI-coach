(Choice A) Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative organism of Lyme disease, is a spirochete
transmitted by the /xodes tick. It cannot be visualized by conventional light microscopy;

diagnosis is made based on clinical symptoms and/or serology.

(Choice B) Leishmania tropica, a protozoa transmitted by sandflies, causes a papule at the
site of inoculation that evolves over weeks or years into an ulcer with an indurated border.
Microscopy can show the oval-round organism within white blood cells.

(Choice D) Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic blood fluke transmitted when humans swim in
fresh water contaminated with infected snails. Schistosomes mature in the liver, reside in the
mesenteric venules, and release eggs that can cause chronic eosinophilic granulomatous
inflammation/fibrosis in organs (eg, bladder, liver, spleen, gastrointestinal tract). Diagnosis is
made by identifying eggs in urine or stool, or on biopsy.

(Choice E) Toxocara canis, also known as dog roundworm, incidentally infects humans and
causes eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation in organs (visceral larva migrans) or the eye
(ocular larva migrans). Diagnosis is made by serology.

(Choice F) Trichinella spiralis is a roundworm infection that can be transmitted to humans
