Educational objective:

Schistosomiasis is a parasitic blood fluke infection that is associated with bathing in freshwater
contaminated with cercariae from infected snails. Patients often are asymptomatic for months
or years but may eventually develop eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation in the liver,
spleen, gastrointestinal tract, or genitourinary system. One common manifestation of
genitourinary schistosomiasis is painless terminal hematuria; eggs can often be identified in

the urine or on biopsy.
