(Choice A) Mosquitos can transmit viral (eg, dengue) and parasitic (eg, malaria) infections.
However, these illnesses cause high fever and other systemic symptoms shortly after
transmission. Eosinophilia and a nematode (ie, roundworm) in the sputum are more
suggestive of helminth infection.

(Choice B) Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochete, is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis tick bite. It
causes Lyme disease, which typically presents with a migrating, target-shaped rash that may
progress to involve the nervous system or joints. Gastrointestinal/pulmonary symptoms and
eosinophilia indicate an alternate diagnosis.

(Choice D) Ingestion of oocysts is a common mode of transmission for protozoan parasites
(eg, Giardia, Cryptosporidium), which often cause diarrhea and crampy abdominal pain.
However, a nematode on sputum microscopy indicates a helminth (ie, parasitic worm)
infection; helminths (eg, strongyloidiasis, ascariasis, schistosomiasis) produce eggs
(containing multicellular embryos), not oocysts (thick-walled spores).

(Choice E) Inhalation of spores can cause a variety of pulmonary fungal infections (eg,
histoplasmosis, aspergillosis). Although these pathogens can cause peripheral eosinophilia
and pulmonary symptoms, helminths would not be seen in sputum samples.
