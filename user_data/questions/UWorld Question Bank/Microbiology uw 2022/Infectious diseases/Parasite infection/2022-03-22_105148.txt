(Choice A) Preconception maternal immunization with the measles, mumps, and rubella
vaccine can prevent congenital rubella infection. Characteristic features of congenital rubella
include hearing loss, cataracts (cloudy cornea), and cardiac defects (eg, patent ductus
arteriosus), none of which are seen in this patient. Moreover, retinal lesions and
hydrocephalus are uncommon, and rubella is a virus, not a crescent-shaped, intracellular
parasite.

(Choice C) Pregnant women should avoid, not preferentially consume, unpasteurized milk
products, primarily to prevent congenital Listeria monocytogenes infection, which can lead to
multiorgan abscesses or fetal demise. Although rare, Toxoplasma and other pathogens can
also spread through raw milk.

(Choice D) Malaria, a parasitic infection transmitted by mosquitoes, can cause intrauterine
infection, but infants with congenital malaria typically present with fever and anemia, not
hydrocephalus and chorioretinitis. In addition, although Plasmodium falciparum is a crescent-
shaped intracellular organism, placental biopsy would show intervillous accumulation of
parasitized red blood cells without calcifications.

(Choice E) Prophylactic penicillin is used during labor to prevent group B Streptococcus
(GBS) transmission to the fetus during delivery. Infection typically leads to early neonatal
