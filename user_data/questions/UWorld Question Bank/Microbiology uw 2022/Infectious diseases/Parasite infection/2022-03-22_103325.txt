4 (Choice A) Liver flukes (eg, Clonorchis, Opisthorchis) most often occur after a person
- consumes contaminated fish. The pathogen can remain in the bile duct of an infected person
7 for decades. Many cases are asymptomatic, but complications such as bile duct obstruction
: can occur.
s (Choice B) Ingestion of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium in the egg stage leads to
neurocysticercosis, which is characterized by the formation of cystic brain lesions.

Manifestations often occur years later and include seizures (primarily) and focal neurologic
signs. Spread of E histolytica to the brain would cause an abscess, not a cyst.

(Choice C) Schistosomiasis is an infection caused by parasitic blood flukes acquired from
bathing/swimming in water contaminated with infected freshwater snails. Intestinal
schistosomiasis (eg, Schistosoma mansoni) can cause colitis, but trophozoites would not be
seen on colonic biopsy. Granulomatous cystitis is seen with genitourinary, not intestinal,
schistosomiasis (eg, Schistosoma haematobium).

(Choice D) Cutaneous larva migrans is a hookworm infection that causes an intensely itchy,
reddish-brown, migrating, serpiginous track in the area near penetration (usually the lower
extremities).
