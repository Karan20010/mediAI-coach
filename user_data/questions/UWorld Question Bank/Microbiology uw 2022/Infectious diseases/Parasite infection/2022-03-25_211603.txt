Enterobiasis, caused by the pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis), is the most prevalent
helminthic infection in the United States and is frequently seen in children. The life cycle
occurs in the gastrointestinal tract, and the adult worms typically live in the cecum and
appendix. In contrast to other worms that release eggs into the intestine, the female worm
migrates to the perianal area at night to deposit eggs. Larvae mature in the eggs within 6
hours, and the infective eggs can either be ingested by the same individual or spread to other
humans. Eggs and worms in the perianal area cause an inflammatory reaction, resulting in
perianal itching (pruritus ani). Scratching contaminates the hands and furthers transmission.

Diagnosis is made by the cellulose tape test (ie, microscopy of adhesive tape applied to the
perianal region), which reveals oval eggs flattened on one side. Treatment options include
albendazole, mebendazole, and pyrantel pamoate.
