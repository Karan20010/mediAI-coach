This patient with an acute febrile illness has a peripheral blood smear showing
intraerythrocytic ring inclusions. Parasites that can potentially cause disease in red blood
cells include Plasmodium (malaria) and Babesia (babesiosis). In this patient, the epidemiology
(residence in northeastern United States, outdoor exposure in the summer) is suggestive of
babesiosis. This organism is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick, which is also a
vector for Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Anaplasma (human granulocytic
anaplasmosis).
