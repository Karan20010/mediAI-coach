sometimes exceeding >20 L a day.

(Choice B) Giardia lamblia is a protozoan that causes watery and sometimes oily diarrhea (ie,
steatorrhea due to fat malabsorption). Stool microscopy demonstrates oval-shaped cysts and
flagellated pear-shaped trophozoites with two large central nuclei. Acid-fast staining is
negative.

(Choice C) Listeria monocytogenes typically causes self-limited (2-3 days) watery diarrhea
associated with fever and muscle/joint pain. Invasive disease (eg, sepsis, meningitis) can
occur in immunocompromised individuals. However, this organism is a gram-positive rod;
acid-fast staining would be negative.

(Choice D) Mycobacterium avium complex can cause disseminated infection in
immunosuppressed patients. Although diarrhea is common, it is typically associated with fever
and weight loss. Blood culture or tissue histology demonstrates acid-fast positive bacilli; stool
culture is less useful for diagnosis as the organism is only found infrequently.

(Choice E) Strongyloides stercoralis causes diarrhea and abdominal pain, but pulmonary
manifestations (eg, cough, dyspnea) and linear, pruritic, erythematous streaks (eg, larva
currens) are typical. Stool microscopy may reveal rhabditiform larva.
