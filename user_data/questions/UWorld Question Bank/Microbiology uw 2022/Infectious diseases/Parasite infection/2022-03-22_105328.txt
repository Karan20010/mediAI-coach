(Choice A) Lymphatic filariasis is a mosquito-borne illness caused by roundworms (eg,
Wuchereria bancrofti). Most patients are infected in childhood and remain asymptomatic, but
a minority develops chronic lymphedema, which may result in elephantiasis. Eggs are not
present in stool; diagnosis is made by serology or by identifying worms in the lymphatic
system.

(Choice B) Chagas disease is linked to dilated cardiomyopathy and is most common in Latin
America. It is caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma cruzi. Transmission occurs during a
triatomine bug bite. Although transient skin and gastrointestinal symptoms can occur during
acute infection, eggs are not seen in the stool; diagnosis is made mostly by serology or by

blood microscopy.

(Choice C) Toxocariasis is caused by infection with dog or cat roundworms. Migrating larva
cause a significant eosinophilic granulomatous response that can result in ocular
(endophthalmitis) and organ damage. Diagnosis is made by serology; the organism does not
shed eggs in the gastrointestinal tract.

(Choice E) Diphyllobothriasis is caused by infection with a fish tapeworm and is classically
linked with megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency. Although the eggs can be
seen on stool microscopy, they are distinguished by a lid-like opening (operculum). In
