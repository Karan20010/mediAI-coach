(Choices B, C, D, and E) Fulminant liver failure can arise due to numerous conditions,
including viral hepatitis, acetaminophen toxicity, idiosyncratic drug reactions, or Wilson
disease. Hypovolemia is typically caused by severe blood loss, although excessive loss of
other bodily fluids (eg, diarrhea, vomiting, burns, dehydration) may also be responsible.
Pulmonary emboli are typically caused by the propagation of venous thrombi, with less
common sources including air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or
malignant cells. Overwhelming systemic infection with bacterial organisms can cause septic
shock (hypotension, low blood flow). None of these conditions is typically associated with
hydatid cysts.

Educational objective:
Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts. Spilling of cyst
contents can cause anaphylactic shock. Surgical manipulation should be performed with

caution.
