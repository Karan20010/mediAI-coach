(Choice B) Early disseminated Lyme disease is associated with neurologic (eg, facial nerve
palsy) and cardiac (eg, atrioventricular block, carditis) manifestations and is often treated with
ceftriaxone. /xodes scapularis, the tick that transmits Lyme disease, can also transmit
babesiosis and ehrlichiosis, which can be treated with doxycycline. Although Babesia can
appear as ring-like structures within blood cells, it is differentiated by the presence of 4 rings
arranged in a Maltese cross pattern, which is pathognomonic for the disease.

(Choice C) P falciparum is the predominant malaria strain in Africa. Most P falciparum in
Africa are resistant to chloroquine, so alternate agents (eg, atovaquone-proguanil,
artemisinins) are required for treatment. Because P falciparum does not have a dormant
hepatic phase, primaquine is not required.

(Choice D) Entamoeba histolytica is an amebic parasite that can cause dysentery (bloody
diarrhea) and extraintestinal abscess in the liver (most common), lung, or brain. It is typically
treated with metronidazole, to kill the trophozoites, and paromomycin, to eliminate residual
cysts in the gastrointestinal lumen.

(Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used to treat Pneumocystis pneumonia, which
is most common in individuals with untreated AIDS or those taking chronic steroids. Patients
