(Choice A) Retinopathy is the most serious long-term adverse effect related to chloroquine
use. It occurs only rarely and is related to prolonged use. Primaquine has no influence on the
occurrence of chloroquine retinopathy.

(Choices B and E) Primaquine has limited therapeutic activity against the erythrocytic forms
of plasmodia, including trophozoites. Primaquine is not effective in treating chloroquine-
resistant strains, which can be managed with mefloquine or quinine, among others.

(Choice D) No antimalarial agent specifically acts to prevent hemolysis. Primaquine is
contraindicated in patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency as the
medication can cause hemolysis.

Educational objective:

Chloroquine is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated malaria contracted in a chloroquine-
sensitive geographic region. It eliminates susceptible erythrocytic forms of all Plasmodium
species. Primaquine is added in the treatment of infections with P vivax and P ovale to
eradicate the intrahepatic stages (hypnozoites) of these malarial species, which are
responsible for relapses.
