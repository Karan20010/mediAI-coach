Chagas disease is divided into 2 phases:

The acute phase (8-12 weeks after transmission) is characterized by circulating
trypomastigotes that are detectable on blood microscopy. Most patients are
asymptomatic, but a minority develop nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, anorexia)
and inflammation/swelling at the site of inoculation (eg, eye swelling following conjunctival
inoculation).

The chronic phase begins when the immune system eliminates circulating parasitemia,
leading to resolution of acute symptoms. Patients subsequently develop a prolonged
asymptomatic phase ("indeterminate form"), whereby serology is positive for T cruzi, but
there are no symptoms, signs, detectable parasitemia, or indications of end-organ
damage. After 1-3 decades, a minority of those with asymptomatic chronic infection
develop end-organ disease of the heart or gastrointestinal system.
