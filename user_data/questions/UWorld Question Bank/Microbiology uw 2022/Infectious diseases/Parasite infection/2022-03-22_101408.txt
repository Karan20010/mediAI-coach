This patient most likely has schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium. Humans
acquire schistosomiasis via contact with infected freshwater. Infection is not possible in the
United States due to absence of the specific freshwater snails that incubate the infectious
larvae.

Once released into the environment, the larvae can penetrate intact human skin and
subsequently travel to the liver where they mature into adults over a period of several weeks.
After maturation, the adult worms migrate to specific destinations: the mesenteric venules of
the intestine (S japonicum and S mansoni) or the urinary bladder venous plexus (S
haematobium). The adult worms remain in these blood vessels for life (5-30 years), adhering
to the vessel wall with suckers and releasing eggs into circulation. Eggs released by S
Japonicum and S mansoni have a tendency to penetrate the bowel wall and be excreted in the
feces. They also frequently traverse the portal venous system and lodge in the liver. S
haematobium eggs tend to pierce the vesical and ureteral walls and be expelled in the urine.
On exposure to freshwater, these eggs release larvae that can infect snails and perpetuate the
life cycle.
