Humans develop T solium tapeworm infection following ingestion of larvae in undercooked
pork. The larvae mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract and shed thousands of
eggs in the stool. Cysticercosis occurs when humans ingest 7 solium eggs in contaminated
food or water. The eggs hatch in the small intestine, invade the bowel wall, and lodge in tissue
(eg, muscle, brain, eyes). Symptoms are rare initially but may develop months or years later
when the cysts degrade.

Most cases present with adult-onset seizure due to an intraparenchymal cyst in the brain.
Examination, laboratory evaluation, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis tend to be normal.
However, imaging usually reveals 21 cysts in various stages of viability, as follows:

e Viable cysts are round, hypodense, and nonenhancing.

¢ Degenerating cysts are enhancing with surrounding tissue edema.
¢ Nonviable cysts are small, solid, and calcified.

Ascolex, the anterior portion of the worm with suckers and hooks, is sometimes visible and is
pathognomonic for the condition.
