(Choice B) Meningioma is the most common CNS neoplasm and often presents with seizure.
However, imaging reveals an extraaxial, dural-based mass that compresses brain tissue. In
addition, histopathology often shows whorls of uniform, oval tumor cells with eosinophilic
cytoplasm, as well as psammoma bodies.

(Choice C) Brain metastases (eg, melanoma) often cause seizures due to focal brain edema.
However, imaging usually reveals multiple masses with surrounding edema at the gray-white
matter junction, not a single cystic temporal lobe lesion. Histopathology is usually similar to
the primary tumor.

(Choice D) Protozoal infections such as toxoplasmosis and amoebic encephalitis can cause
brain infection with seizure. However, toxoplasmosis appears as ring-enhancing lesions on
imaging, and histology shows spherical cysts and tachyzoites, not a scolex. Amoebic
encephalitis typically appears as nonspecific brain edema on imaging, and histology shows
trophozoites and cysts.

(Choice E) Tuberculosis can spread to the meninges or CNS. Tuberculomas in the brain can
cause seizures, but imaging reveals ring-enhancing intraparenchymal lesions, not cysts. In
addition, histopathology would show caseating granulomas with acid-fast bacilli.
