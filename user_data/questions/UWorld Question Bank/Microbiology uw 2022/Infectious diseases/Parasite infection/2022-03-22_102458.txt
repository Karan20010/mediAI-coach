(Choice F) Trichinella spiralis is a roundworm infection that can be transmitted to humans
when they ingest larvae (eg, from contaminated pork). Larvae spread through the blood to the
muscle and form cysts, causing muscle pain, weakness, and swelling. Diagnosis is usually
made by serology or muscle biopsy; the parasite is not intraerythrocytic.

(Choice G) Wuchereria bancrofti is a roundworm that is transmitted by mosquitos and causes
lymphatic infection (eg, lymphedema, adenolymphangitis). Blood smear (performed in the
evening) can often demonstrate the long, thin microfilaria in the circulation; it is not ring-
shaped or intraerythrocytic.
