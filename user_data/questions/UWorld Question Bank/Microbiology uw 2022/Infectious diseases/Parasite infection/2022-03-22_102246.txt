Educational objective:

Chagas disease is a protozoal illness that is endemic to Latin America. Patients in rural areas
are at greatest risk when their houses harbor the vector (Triatome bug) in adobe walls or
thatched roofs. Acute infections are often asymptomatic, but patients can develop Chagas
cardiomyopathy (eg, heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular aneurysms) several

decades later.
