Filariform larvae in the soil penetrate the skin, travel through the bloodstream/lymphatics, and
enter the alveoli. They ascend the tracheobronchial tree and are swallowed. The larvae
mature into adult worms in the gastrointestinal tract, enter the mucosa of the duodenum and
jejunum, and secrete noninfectious rhabditiform larvae into stool for excretion. A few
rhabditiform larvae mature into filiform larvae in the gastrointestinal tract and reinfect the host
through the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin (autoinoculation).

Many patients are asymptomatic because the host immune system keeps the organism in
check; however, symptoms may emerge in the setting of immunocompromise due to
medications (eg, glucocorticoid therapy) or comorbid illness (eg, cancer, HIV). Common
manifestations include the following:

¢ Larva currens: Larvae migrate through cutaneous tissue near the site of penetration,
leaving narrow, reddish-brown streaks.

¢ Pulmonary symptoms: Larvae passing through the lungs can cause dyspnea, wheezing,
and dry cough.

¢ Gastrointestinal symptoms: Larvae in the gastrointestinal tract can cause diarrhea,
constipation, and abdominal pain.

Most patients also have peripheral eosinophilia. The diagnosis is typically made when
