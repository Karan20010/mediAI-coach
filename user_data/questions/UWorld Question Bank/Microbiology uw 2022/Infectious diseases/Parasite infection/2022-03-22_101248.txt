Ascolex, the anterior portion of the worm with suckers and hooks, is sometimes visible and is
pathognomonic for the condition.

(Choice A) Cryptococcal meningitis, a yeast infection common in patients with AIDS, usually
presents with subacute fever, malaise, and headache. CSF evaluation usually shows
increased pressure, mildly elevated leukocyte count, and low glucose level. Imaging may
reveal hydrocephalus, but focal lesions (eg, calcifications) indicate an alternate diagnosis.

(Choice B) Tuberculosis can spread to the CNS and form a tuberculoma. Although patients
may develop seizure, CSF usually shows lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis and elevated
protein. In addition, neuroimaging will show ring-enhancing lesions.

(Choice D) Neurosyphilis can cause meningovascular disease early after infection and tabes
dorsalis or general paresis years later. However, seizures are fairly uncommon, and CSF
evaluation typically shows lymphocyte-predominant pleocytosis and elevated protein.

(Choice E) Toxoplasmosis is most common in patients with AIDS. Although seizure may
occur, neuroimaging usually reveals ring-enhancing lesions, not calcifications. Patients also
typically have fever.
