Areas of necrosis and diminished blood supply (such as chronic, nonhealing ulcers) facilitate
the growth of anaerobes. Bacteroides are gram-negative anaerobic rods that can produce B-
lactamase, an enzyme that breaks down penicillins. B-lactamase inhibitors such as
tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam prevent these enzymes from functioning. The
combination of piperacillin (extended-spectrum penicillin) and tazobactam is effective against
a large number of gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria and would be the
most appropriate option among the medications listed. Other antimicrobials with anaerobic
activity include metronidazole, carbapenems, and clindamycin (in most cases). In patients
with diabetes who have a necrotic (foul-smelling) infected ulcer, broad-spectrum antimicrobial
coverage should be used as polymicrobial infection with organisms other than Bacteroides
may be present.
