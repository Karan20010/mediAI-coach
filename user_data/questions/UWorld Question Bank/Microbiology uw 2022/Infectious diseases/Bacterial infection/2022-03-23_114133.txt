This patient has high fever, cough, leukocytosis, and a right lung infiltrate indicating lobar
pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia is most commonly caused by extracellular bacterial pathogens
such as Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus

pneumoniae (Choices A, D, and E). The immune response to extracellular organisms is
primarily mediated by neutrophils early in infection and by the humoral antibody response (B
lymphocytes, immunoglobulins, complement) as time goes on.

In this case, components of the cell-mediated immune response were primarily involved in
controlling the infection, suggesting that the pneumonia was most likely due to an intracellular
pathogen such as Legionella pneumophila (a common cause of atypical community-
acquired pneumonia). Intracellular pathogens are phagocytosed by macrophages but are
initially resistant to destruction due to the presence of virulence factors that inhibit phagosome-
lysosome fusion (eg, Legionella) or phagolysosome acidification (eg, Mycobacteria
tuberculosis), or allow bacteria to escape from the phagolysosome (eg, Listeria
monocytogenes).
