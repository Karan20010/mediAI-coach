= organisms with carbapenem resistance have emerged).
- (Choice A) Mutations in DNA gyrase can lead to fluoroquinolone resistance and generally do
7 not impact beta-lactam antibiotic activity.
8
9 (Choice B) Porin mutations can confer penicillin and aminoglycoside resistance and are
70 particularly important in gram-negative organisms such as Pseudomonas.
i1
v2 (Choice C) Penicillin-binding protein alterations are the mechanism that leads to methicillin
13
m resistance in Staphylococcus aureus.
(Choice D) Vancomycin inhibits glycopeptide polymerization through binding to D-alanyl-D-
v alanine in the cell wall precursor; peptidoglycan changes (eg, D-alanine-D-lactate) can develop
18
19 as a resistance mechanism.

(Choice F) Ribosome mutations can confer resistance to ribosome-targeting antibiotics such

+ 2 as aminoglycosides and macrolides.

Educational objective:
Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases can be produced by gram-negative bacteria, rendering
cephalosporins and other beta-lactam antibiotics inactive. These genes can be transmitted

between organisms through plasmid conjugation. ctivate V
