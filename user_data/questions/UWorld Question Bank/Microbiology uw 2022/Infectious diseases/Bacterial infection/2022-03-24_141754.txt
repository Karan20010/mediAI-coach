Enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of foodborne illness. This
pathogen inoculates food during unsanitary preparation by an asymptomatic carrier. Storage
of the food at room temperature for extended periods (eg, picnic, pot luck meal) allows the
bacteria to proliferate and generate a heat-stable enterotoxin. Ingestion of the preformed
toxin leads to rapid-onset illness that includes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.
Occasionally, mild fever and diarrhea may also be present. Symptoms resolve in a few hours
with symptomatic care.

Because the disease is due to the ingestion of a preformed toxin, no person-to-person
transmission occurs. However, outbreaks may arise when people eat the same contaminated
food at an event or party. High risk foods include dairy products, produce, precooked meat,
eggs, and mayonnaise-based salads (eg, chicken salad).

Asimilar clinical picture of rapid-onset nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping can be seen
with food-borne illness due to Bacillus cereus, which also produces a heat-stable enterotoxin.
B cereus characteristically contaminates starchy foods (eg, rice); illness is often associated
with reheated rice.
