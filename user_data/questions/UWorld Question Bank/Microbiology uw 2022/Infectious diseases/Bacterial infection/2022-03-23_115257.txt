usually required to prevent death.

(Choice A) Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nasopharynx and is a leading cause of
skin/soft-tissue abscess. However, S aureus is a catalase-positive, gram-positive bacterium.

(Choice C) Leptospira species are highly motile, gram-negative spirochetes that are often
transmitted via contaminated rat urine. Leptospirosis is often mild or asymptomatic but may
cause fever, myalgia, headache, multiorgan failure, or death. This patient who developed
symptoms after a sustaining a wound while boating is more likely to have a V vulnificus
infection.

(Choice D) Clostridium tetani is an anaerobic, gram-positive, spore-forming rod-shaped
bacterium that can inoculate wounds contaminated with soil. It elaborates an exotoxin
(tetanus toxin) that disinhibits anterior horn cells and results in painful muscle contractions,
lock-jaw, and difficulty swallowing.

(Choice E) Clostridium difficile is most common in individuals who have recently taken broad-
spectrum antibiotics, which disrupts gastrointestinal flora and allows the organism to
proliferate. Patients usually develop diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.
