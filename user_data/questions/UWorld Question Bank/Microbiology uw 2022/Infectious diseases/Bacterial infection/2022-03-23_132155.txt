The patient had impetigo, a skin infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and less
commonly by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococci [GAS]). Her facial puffiness
(likely due to sodium and water retention and possibly proteinuria) and hematuria (likely due to
nephritis) suggest post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. Staphylococcal infection is not

complicated by glomerulonephritis, so S pyogenes is the most likely causative organism of her
symptoms.
