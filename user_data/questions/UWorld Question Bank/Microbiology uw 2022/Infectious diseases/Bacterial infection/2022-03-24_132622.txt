Vibrio cholerae is a comma-shaped, oxidase-positive, highly motile, gram-negative rod that is

acquired after ingesting contaminated food or wa

er. The infection is not invasive and does not

disseminate outside of the gastrointestinal tract. However, the elaboration of the cholera

enterotoxin leads to severe, watery diarrhea tha

can cause death from electrolyte imbalance

and dehydration within 12 hours of symptom onset. Cholera is endemic in southern Asia and

parts of Africa and Latin America, where seasona

outbreaks are common (peaks occur prior to

and after rainy seasons). In the United States, the disease is rare and occurs mainly in

patients who ingest contaminated seafood from the Gulf Coast.

V cholerae must survive the acidic environment o

the stomach to reach the small intestine and

cause disease. Because the organism is very acid-sensitive, a high burden of V cholerae is

generally required to cause clinical symptoms (>1

0 organisms from contaminated water or

>10Â° organisms from contaminated food). However, those with inadequate gastric acid

production (achlorhydria) can develop the disease with much smaller infectious doses as

there is insufficient acid to kill the bacteria. Patients on long-term proton pump inhibitor

therapy (eg, omeprazole) have pharmacologically induced achlorhydria; it can also be seen in

those with gastritis.
