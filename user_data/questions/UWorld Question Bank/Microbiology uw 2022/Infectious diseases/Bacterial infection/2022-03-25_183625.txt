Neutrophils are normally the most prevalent circulating leukocyte and are a crucial component
of innate immunity against bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore, patients with
neutropenia are unable to mount a strong, initial defense against invading bacterial pathogens,
leading to rapid-onset, life-threatening infection.

Purulence is usually absent because it forms only when there are enough neutrophils to
substantially accumulate in an area of infection. However, other signs of infection that do not
rely on neutrophils may be present. Bacterial components activate toll-like receptors on
macrophages and dendritic cells, which subsequently release inflammatory cytokines that
cause local tissue inflammation (eg, erythema, swelling, pain) and systemic symptoms (eg,
fever, chills, hypotension) (Choices A, B, C, and E).

Educational objective:

Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy are at high risk for bacterial infections due to
neutropenia. Neutropenic fever often manifests with fever, chills, and hypotension but
purulence is rare due to a lack of neutrophils.
