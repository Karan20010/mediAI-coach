This patient's subacute systemic symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss, weakness),
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and intracellular acid-
fast bacteria raise strong suspicion for disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC).
MAC is an infection caused by the nontuberculous mycobacteria M avium and
Mycobacterium intracellulare. Although these infections can occur in both immunocompetent
and immunosuppressed hosts, most cases arise in patients with untreated AIDS who have
CD4 counts <50/mm:.
