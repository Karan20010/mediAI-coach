(Choice A) Anterior uveitis (inflammation of the iris) can be caused by infectious processes
(eg, herpes viruses, syphilis, Lyme disease) and inflammatory conditions (eg, HLA-B27-related
diseases, sarcoidosis). It is not associated with viridans streptococcal infections.

(Choice B) S bovis is associated with colon cancer, and patients with S bovis endocarditis
should undergo colonoscopic evaluation to exclude neoplasia.

(Choice D) Erythema nodosum (erythematous to violaceous subcutaneous nodules usually
appearing on the legs) is a nonspecific finding. It is associated with multiple bacterial
infections, most commonly S pyogenes pharyngitis, but also Staphylococcus aureus, fungi (eg,
coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis), chlamydia, and others. It is also
associated with Crohn disease, sarcoidosis, and other inflammatory conditions.

(Choices E and F) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a type III (immune complex-
mediated) hypersensitivity reaction in which immune complexes deposit on the glomerular
membrane and fix complement, leading to inflammation, renal dysfunction, hematuria, and
nephritic range proteinuria. Migratory polyarthritis is a characteristic of rheumatic fever, an
immune-mediated disease. These conditions typically follow infections with group A
Streptococcus (S pyogenes), which does not produce dextrans.
