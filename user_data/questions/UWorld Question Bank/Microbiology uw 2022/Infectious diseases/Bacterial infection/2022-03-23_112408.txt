food-borne illness. Ingestion of preformed toxin leads to rapid-onset vomiting and abdominal

pain; mild diarrhea (noninflammatory) can occur. S aureus is linked to precooked foods, dairy

reheated rice).

(Choice C) Giardia lamblia is usually transmitted by contaminated water; food-borne or
person-to-person spread may occur. Symptoms include foul-smelling, watery diarrhea that is
noninflammatory. In addition, stool ova and parasite testing often reveals Giardia trophozoites
or cysts.

(Choice D) Norovirus, the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis, is usually transmitted
