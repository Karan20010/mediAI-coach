Educational objective:

¢ The aminoglycoside streptomycin inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating the 30S (small)
ribosomal subunit.

¢ Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of mycobacterial
resistance to isoniazid.

¢ Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis (DNA-dependent RNA
polymerase) is the mechanism through which organisms become resistant to rifampin.
