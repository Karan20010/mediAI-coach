This infant with high fever, irritability, vomiting, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis has
meningitis. Empiric treatment with cefotaxime and vancomycin would cover the majority of
likely pathogens in this age group including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria
meningitidis, Haemophilus influenzae, group B streptococcus, and Escherichia coli. However,
it would not cover Listeria monocytogenes, which has intrinsic resistance to third-
generation cephalosporins (eg, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone) due to the presence of penicillin-
binding proteins that have a low-affinity for this drug class. Coverage of Listeria requires
the addition of ampicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic with a specialized side-group that allows it
to bind to and inactivate the penicillin bindina proteins of Listeria.
