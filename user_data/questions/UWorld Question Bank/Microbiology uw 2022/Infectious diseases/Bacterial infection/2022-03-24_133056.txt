Enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus produces a heat-stable enterotoxin that is a
common cause of foodborne illness. This pathogen is typically introduced into high-risk foods
(eg, mayonnaise-based salads, eggs, dairy, previously cooked meats) during improper food
handling by an asymptomatic carrier. Storage at room temperature for extended periods
allows the organism to quickly proliferate and generate enterotoxin. Individuals then ingest the
preformed enterotoxin and become rapidly ill with nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and,
occasionally, fever and mild diarrhea. Symptoms quickly resolve with supportive care.

Multiple individuals are often affected due to the consumption of the same food at a picnic,

party, or potluck.

Staphylococcal foodborne illness can be prevented by washing hands thoroughly with soap
and water prior to preparing food (prevents contamination) and ensuring proper refrigerated
food storage when food will not be consumed within 2 hours of preparation (prevents
bacterial proliferation/enterotoxin production).
