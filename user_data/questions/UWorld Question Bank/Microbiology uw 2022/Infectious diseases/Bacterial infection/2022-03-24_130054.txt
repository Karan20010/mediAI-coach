A 24-year-old man comes to the emergency department with leg swelling. His dog, which is
fully vaccinated and has lived with him for the past year, bit him on the left leg last night,
leading to a break in the skin and bleeding. The patient irrigated the wound with bottled water
and soap and managed his pain with acetaminophen. This morning, the wound area became
warm, red, and swollen. On examination, temperature is 36.4 C (97.5 F). There is an open
wound on the left leg, with surrounding erythema, warmth, and tenderness. No wound
drainage or crepitus is present. The distal pulses are palpable. Wound cultures grow gram-
negative coccobacilli; the culture has a mouse-like odor. Which of the following organisms is
