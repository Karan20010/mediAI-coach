Educational objective:

Rocky mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness due to Rickettsia rickettsii, a weakly gram-
negative, obligate intracellular organism that has an affinity for vascular endothelial cells.
Patients usually have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, malaise, myalgia) followed by a
macular-petechial rash that begins on the ankles and wrists and spreads to the center of the
body as well as to the palms and soles. Urgent treatment with doxycycline, an inhibitor of
bacterial protein synthesis, is required.
