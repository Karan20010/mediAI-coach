Legionella and other intracellular pathogens that initially replicate within the phagosome
eventually undergo some degree of digestion by lysosomes, leading to the display of bacterial
antigens on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class || molecules. This stimulates naive
CD4 T lymphocytes to differentiate into T-helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells. Th1 cells release
interferon-gamma, which activates macrophages and allows them to form fully mature
(acidified) phagolysosomes capable of efficiently killing the intracellular bacteria. Th1 cells
also release interleukin-2, which activates and expands the population of naive T cells, Th1
cells, and memory T cells.
