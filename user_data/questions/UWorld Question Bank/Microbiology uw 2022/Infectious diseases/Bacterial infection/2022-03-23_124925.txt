a chocolate sheep blood agar infused with vancomycin to inhibit gram-positive bacteria; with
colistin and trimethoprim to inhibit gram-negative bacteria (other than pathogenic Neisseria
species); and with nystatin to inhibit yeast.
(Choice A) The most common cause of cystitis is Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod

inhibited by colistin and trimethoprim. E coli is nota common nasopharyngeal organism.

(Choice B) Dental carries are caused primarily by Streptococcus (eg, S mutans) and
Lactobacillus species, gram-positive organisms inhibited by vancomycin.

(Choice C) Corynebacterium diphtheriae is the cause of diphtheria. It usually presents with
slow-onset sore throat, malaise, and low-grade fever. C diphtheriae is a gram-positive
organism inhibited by vancomycin.

(Choices E and F) The most common cause of both otitis media and community-acquired
pneumonia in adults is Streptococcus pneumoniae. Although S pneumoniae can colonize the
nasopharynx, this gram-positive organism is inhibited by vancomycin.

(Choice G) Rheumatic heart disease is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (group A
streptococci), a common gram-positive pharyngeal pathogen. S pyogenes is inhibited by
vancomycin.
