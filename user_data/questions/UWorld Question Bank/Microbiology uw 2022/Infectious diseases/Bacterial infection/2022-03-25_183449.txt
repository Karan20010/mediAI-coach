(Choice A) Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes and removes phosphate from
other compounds (eg, proteins, enzymes). It is mainly found in the bone, liver, bile ducts, and
placenta. Alkaline phosphatase can be elevated in biliary conditions, bone disease (eg,
osteomalacia), and leukemia/lymphoma. However, it is usually not affected by parotitis.

(Choice C) Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) helps convert glutathione to glutamate. It
12 can be found in many organs, including the liver. GGT elevation suggests that alkaline
phosphatase elevation is due to liver (not bone) pathology.

(Choice E) Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is secreted by the chief cells of the parathyroid gland
17 and increases serum calcium to maintain calcium homeostasis. PTH has effects on the kidney

and bone but is not elevated with parotitis.

: Educational objective:

+ 2 Acute bacterial parotitis occurs more commonly in elderly postoperative patients who are
intubated or dehydrated. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial etiology.
Diagnosis can be confirmed by imaging and an elevated serum amylase level (with a normal
serum lipase level and no evidence of pancreatitis).
