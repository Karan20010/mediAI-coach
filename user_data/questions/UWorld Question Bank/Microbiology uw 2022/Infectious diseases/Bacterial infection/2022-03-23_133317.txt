proteins, blocking transpeptidase formation in the cell wall, and activating autolytic enzymes.
(Choice A) Fluconazole is an antifungal commonly used to treat Candida albicans; when
cultured, C albicans forms smooth, cream-colored colonies consisting of branching
pseudohyphae and blastoconidia (ie, buds).

(Choice B) Metronidazole can be used to treat anaerobic infections such as Trichomonas
vaginalis and Gardnerella vaginalis (ie, bacterial vaginosis), which are typically diagnosed on
wet mount microscopy. T vaginalis appears as motile, flagellated trophozoites; bacterial
vaginosis can be identified by clue cells (ie, squamous epithelial cells covered with bacteria).
Although Actinomyces is a facultative anaerobe, most isolates are resistant to metronidazole.

(Choice C) Nitrofurantoin achieves high, bactericidal concentrations in urine. Therefore, it is
used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are most commonly caused
by Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod.

(Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is ineffective against Actinomyces. It is commonly
used to treat Nocardia, which has the classic appearance of filamentous, wide-branching,
gram-positive rods rather than rods with acute-angle branching as seen in Actinomyces.

Educational objective:

Actinomyces is an anaerobic, gram-positive bacillus with acute-angle branching. It can
