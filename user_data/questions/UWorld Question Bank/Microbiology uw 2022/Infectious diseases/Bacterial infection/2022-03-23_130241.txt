(Choices B, C, D, and E) Contiguous spread from a mediastinal focus (eg, Staphylococcal
mediastinitis), direct inoculation (eg, surgery, penetrating trauma), hematogenous
dissemination of a distant infection, and reactivation of a dormant infection (eg, tuberculosis)
are all possible but less common etiologies of bacterial contamination of the pleural space
leading to empyema. In the absence of evidence that suggests one of these sources (eg,
recent surgery or trauma, lymphocyte-predominant effusion consistent with tuberculosis),
empyema in this patient is most likely due to bacterial translocation from the alveoli (a
complication of pneumonia).
