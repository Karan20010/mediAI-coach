This patient has purulent arthritis of the knee, oligoarticular joint pain, and a few
vesiculopustular lesions on the extremities, raising suspicion for disseminated gonococcal
infection (DGI). DGI is one of the most common causes of septic arthritis in young, sexually
active individuals. It is due to the spread of Neisseria gonorrhoeae from a (usually
asymptomatic) genitourinary infection into the systemic circulation. Patients typically present
with either purulent arthritis or the triad of polyarthralgia, dermatitis, and tenosynovitis;
however, some overlap in these 2 syndromes can occur (as in this patient). Microscopy of
blood, urine, or joint fluid samples will often reveal gram-negative intracellular diplococci.
