(Choice A) Canned foods that are contaminated with Clostridium botulinum can be
associated with foodborne illness due to the consumption of preformed botulism toxin.
Patients typically develop descending, symmetric paralysis.

(Choices B and D) The consumption of preformed, heat-stable Staphylococcus aureus
enterotoxin causes self-limited nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping 1-6 hours after
ingestion. Dairy (eg, custard), produce, meats, eggs (eg, mayonnaise), and salads are
common culprits and are usually inoculated during preparation by a food handler.

(Choice C) Bacillus cereus enterotoxin is classically associated with reheated rice. It causes
a vomiting-predominant, foodborne illness that clinically resembles the illness seen with S
aureus enterotoxin.

(Choice E) Consumption of raw oysters can lead to infection with Vibrio parahaemolyticus
(which causes voluminous watery diarrhea similar to cholera) and Vibrio vulnificus (which
causes sepsis with high mortality), as well as other Vibrio infections.

(Choice F) The consumption of raw eggs or incompletely cooked poultry can lead to
Salmonella gastroenteritis, which usually causes watery diarrhea, abdominal cramping,
vomiting, and fever. Activate Windows
