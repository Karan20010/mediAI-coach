and water prior to preparing food (prevents contamination) and ensuring proper refrigerated
food storage when food will not be consumed within 2 hours of preparation (prevents
bacterial proliferation/enterotoxin production).

(Choice A) Close contact with an individual who has rotavirus infection can lead to the
transmission of the virus with subsequent acute infectious diarrhea (particularly in young
children [age <5]). Staphylococcal gastroenteritis occurs when a preformed toxin is ingested
in food; person-to-person transmission does not occur.

(Choice B) Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli is typically transmitted due to eating
undercooked, contaminated ground beef. Manifestations typically begin 3-4 days (not hours)
after ingestion and include toxin-mediated (Shiga toxin) colitis with bloody stools; some
patients may also develop hemolytic uremic syndrome.

(Choice D) Treatment of drinking water can prevent giardia infection, which usually causes
foul-smelling, watery diarrhea 7-10 days after transmission.

(Choice E) Washing hands prior to eating can prevent the transmission of a wide range of
pathogens. Hand washing would not be protective against enterotoxins present in food.
