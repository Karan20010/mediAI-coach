Educational objective:

Actinomyces species are gram-positive, branching, filamentous bacteria that may cause
cervicofacial infections when introduced to the submucosa during mechanical trauma (eg,
tooth extraction). Manifestations include a slowly enlarging, nonpainful, chronic mandibular
mass that evolves into multiple abscesses and sinus tracts draining yellow-orange sulfur
granules.
