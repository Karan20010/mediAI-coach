(Choices A and F) Brucellosis most often develops following consumption of unpasteurized

animal products (eg, sheep milk) or contact with infected animals (eg, cattle, pigs, sheep,

goats). Manifestations (eg, fever, night sweats, arthralgias) progress slowly and are often

nonspecific, but painful regional lymphadenitis would be atypical; in addition, microscopic

examination would reveal small, intracellular gram-negative rods.

(Choice B) The handling of animal hides can transmit anthrax, which often causes systemic
symptoms and regional lymphadenitis. However, patients usually have a large necrotic skin
ulcer with central eschar and surrounding erythema at the inoculation site. In addition, Bacillus
anthracis, the causative agent, is a gram-positive, spore-forming rod.

(Choice C) Hunting and skinning small mammals (eg, rabbits, squirrels) is a common cause
of tularemia, which often presents with painful regional lymphadenitis and fever. However,
patients usually develop a papular lesion at the inoculation site that ulcerates. Although
Francisella tularensis, the causative pathogen, is also a gram-negative coccobacillus, it is not
associated with bipolar staining.

(Choice D) Cleaning a chicken coop can transmit Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic
fungus that primarily resides in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Most cases

present with pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, and systemic
