caspofungin-resistant strain of Candida (uncommon).

(Choice A) Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal that binds ergosterol in the fungal cell
membrane and leads to pore formation and cell lysis.

(Choice C) Flucytosine inhibits the synthesis of both DNA (replication) and RNA (protein
synthesis) in fungal cells. It is mainly used as a synergistic agent with amphotericin B,
particularly in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis.

(Choice D) Griseofulvin enters fungal cells, binds microtubules, and inhibits mitosis. This
antifungal drug is effective only against dermatophyte fungi as it accumulates in keratin-
containing tissues.

(Choice E) Itraconazole is an azole antifungal that inhibits ergosterol synthesis. It does not
affect the polysaccharides of the fungal cell wall.

(Choice F) Terbinafine accumulates in skin and nails and is used to treat dermatophytosis.
Terbinafine inhibits the fungal enzyme squalene epoxidase, which ultimately results in
decreased ergosterol synthesis.
