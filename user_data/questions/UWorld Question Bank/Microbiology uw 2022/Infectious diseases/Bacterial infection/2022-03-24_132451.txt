Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection caused by the motile spirochete Leptospira. Transmission
primarily occurs when humans come into contact with water contaminated with animal urine
during outdoor recreational or occupational activities. Patients classically have a mild, self-
limited, flulike illness but may develop more serious complications such as renal or hepatic

failure.
