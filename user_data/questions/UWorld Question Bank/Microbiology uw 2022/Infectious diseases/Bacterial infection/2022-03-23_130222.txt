Thoracentesis yielding purulent fluid is diagnostic of empyema, a pleural effusion that has
been contaminated by bacteria (or, rarely, fungi or parasites) with subsequent inflammatory
progression and fibrotic organization within the pleural space (often with loculated fluid
collections). Empyema most commonly results from bacterial translocation from the alveoli
into the pleural space and represents advanced progression of a complicated
parapneumonic effusion. Affected patients have a symptomatic presentation similar to that of
pneumonia (eg, fever, cough, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain), but the presentation
can be more insidious than uncomplicated pneumonia, taking place over 1-2 weeks or more.

Treatment of empyema requires prompt drainage (eg, chest tube, surgery in some cases) in
addition to antibiotics. Following drainage, some patients have persistent pleural fibrosis that
prevents full lung reexpansion, a complication known as trapped lung.
