Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive, sporulating bacterium that primarily affects herbivores
(eg, sheep, cows) that graze on contaminated pastures. However, transmission to humans
can occasionally occur due to inhalation, ingestion, or cutaneous inoculation of B anthracis
spores. Risk is greatest in those who handle contaminated hides, animal hair (eg, wool), or
carcasses. Cutaneous exposure usually results in a painless papule that rapidly ulcerates and
subsequently turns into a black eschar.

B anthracis spores germinate at tissue temperatures into vegetative rods that have 2 main
virulence factors:

¢ A polypeptide capsule composed of poly-y-D-glutamic acid, which inhibits phagocytosis

¢ Atrimeric exotoxin composed of protective antigen, edema factor, and lethal factor
Protective antigen binds to a host cell membrane receptor on macrophages and forms a
channel that delivers lethal factor and edema factor into the cell. Lethal factor is a zinc
metalloproteinase that inhibits MAP kinase signal transduction, leading to cell death. Edema
factor is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase that increases cyclic AMP

concentration, leading to accumulation of fluid within/between cells and suppression of
neutrophil and macrophage function.
