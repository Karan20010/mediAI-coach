Diphtheria

Epidemiology

Rare in developed countries due to widespread
vaccination
Risk: inadequate vaccination/10-year booster shot

Pathogenesis

Toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae colonizes
respiratory tract — secretes diphtheria toxin — inhibits
host protein synthesis (ADP-ribosylation of EF-2) — local
and systemic toxin-mediated effects

Manifestations

Local: pseudomembranous pharyngitis, cervical LAD

¢ Systemic: myocarditis/heart failure, neurologic toxicity

¢ Pharyngeal edema/pseudomembrane spread can obstruct

respiratory tract

Treatment

¢ Diphtheria antitoxin (most important)

Antibiotics

EF-2 = elongation factor-2; LAD = lymphadenopathy.
