obtained during the day may show false negative results, as in this patient's initial sample,
because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency.

(Choice A) A first-morning void is typically more (not less) concentrated than a sample
obtained during the day. Detection of urinary nitrites is more likely in concentrated than in
dilute urine; this is likely related to relatively decreased oral intake of fluids, and therefore
urinary frequency as well, leading to a prolonged duration of bacteria in the bladder.

(Choice B) Leukocyte esterase, another common dipstick finding in UTIs, is released by lysed
neutrophils/macrophages and is a marker of white blood cell activity and inflammation.
However, nitrite production is not related to white blood cell activity.

(Choice D) Antibiotic-resistant organisms can lead to persistent abnormalities on urine studies
despite empiric antibiotic therapy. However, resistance would not affect bacteria's ability to
produce nitrate reductase, and therefore does not explain this patient's new finding of nitrites.

(Choice E) Bacterial contaminants can alter culture results due to the prolonged incubation
time of the test. However, the short duration between urine collection and dipstick analysis is
insufficient for nitrite production from contaminants. Moreover, contaminants that can produce
nitrites are typically from the stool, not the skin.
