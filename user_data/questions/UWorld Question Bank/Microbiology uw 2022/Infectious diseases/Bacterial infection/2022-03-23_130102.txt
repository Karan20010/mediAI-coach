This patient with positive Escherichia coli blood cultures has altered mental status,
hypotension, and tachycardia, findings consistent with septic shock.

Pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock caused by gram-negative bacteria (eg, E coll)
involves the release of bacterial endotoxins into the bloodstream, which induce a massive
release of inflammatory cytokines. The most potent endotoxin of gram-negative bacteria is
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a heat-stable component in the outer membrane that is released
with destruction of the bacterial cell wall or during cell division.

The major virulence component of LPS is lipid A, which is located on the inner portion of the
molecule and provides an anchor into the cell membrane. It activates toll-like receptors on
innate immune cells (eg, macrophages), triggering the release of endogenous pyrogens (eg,
IL-1, IL-6, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
interferon). These cytokines disrupt endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability,
resulting in profound hypotension and end-organ dysfunction/failure.
