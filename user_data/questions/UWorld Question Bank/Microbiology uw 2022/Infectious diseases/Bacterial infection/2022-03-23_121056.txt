Educational objective:

Haemophilus influenzae is a "blood-loving" organism that requires X (hematin) and V (NAD+)
factors for growth. This can be accomplished by growing H influenzae in the presence of
Staphylococcus aureus and demonstrating the "satellite phenomenon," whereby H influenzae
grow only near the B-hemolytic S aureus colonies that produce the needed X and V factors.
