This patient has acute rheumatic fever, an immune-mediated disease following an untreated
group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. Antibodies against GAS cross-react with host
tissues due to molecular mimicry between GAS antigens and cardiac and central nervous
system antigens. Specifically, antibodies directed against GAS antigens, M protein and N-
acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine, subsequently attack myosin, a cardiac protein, and
lysoganglioside, a neuronal cell surface protein.

The major manifestations of acute rheumatic fever include arthritis, pancarditis, Sydenham
chorea, erythema marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules. This patient's murmur is likely due
to acute mitral regurgitation from pancarditis. Sydenham chorea presents with non-
rhythmic movements of the hands, feet, and face. Patients often have sudden changes in
voice pitch and volume. Erythema marginatum presents as faintly erythematous, circular
lesions with central clearing that come and go on the trunk and extremities.
