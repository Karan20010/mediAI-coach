The presence of gram-positive cocci in clusters that do not respond to nafcillin but show
sensitivity to vancomycin suggests infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA). S aureus is a common cause of skin infections in the United States. Most
skin infections are minor, but S aureus can cause serious infections (eg, surgical wound
infections, bloodstream infections in the presence of central intravenous catheters,
pneumonia).

S aureus strains that are resistant to oxacillin, nafcillin, and methicillin have been historically
termed MRSA, but they are also resistant to all B-lactam agents, including penicillin,
cephalosporins (except ceftaroline, a fifth-generation cephalosporin), and carbapenems.
Methicillin (nafcillin) resistance is typically mediated by alterations in the structure of
penicillin-binding proteins (PBP), the enzymes involved in cell wall synthesis. Altered PBPs,
especially PBP2a, have greatly reduced affinity for B-lactam antimicrobial agents (except
ceftaroline).
