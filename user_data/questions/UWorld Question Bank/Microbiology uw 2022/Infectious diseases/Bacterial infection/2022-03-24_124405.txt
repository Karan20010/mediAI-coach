(Choice D) Cleaning a chicken coop can transmit Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic
fungus that primarily resides in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. Most cases
present with pulmonary infiltrates, mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy, and systemic
symptoms. Regional lymphadenitis would be uncommon; in addition, the organism is a

fungus, not a coccobacillus.
