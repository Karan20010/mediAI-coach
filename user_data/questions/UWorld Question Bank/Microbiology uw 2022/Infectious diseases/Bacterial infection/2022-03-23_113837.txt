This patient with HIV now has headaches, fevers, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures growing
Mycobacterium tuberculosis; this presentation is consistent with tuberculous meningitis.

The mechanism of action of isoniazid (INH) is the inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis by M
tuberculosis. INH accomplishes this through an incompletely understood method. However, it
is known that INH must be processed by mycobacterial catalase peroxidase for the drug to
be activated within the bacteria, and that INH requires a specific protein sequence in its
enzyme target (necessary for mycolic acid synthesis). For this reason, mycobacterial
resistance to INH could be accomplished through non-expression of the catalase-peroxidase
enzyme or through genetic modification of the INH binding site on the mycolic acid synthesis

enzyme.
