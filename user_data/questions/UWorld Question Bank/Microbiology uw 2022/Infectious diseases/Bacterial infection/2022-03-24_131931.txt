Educational objective:

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a major pathogen in burn patients. Only a few specific penicillins
(eg, ticarcillin, piperacillin) and cephalosporins (eg, ceftazidime, cefepime) have activity
against it. Certain aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), and
carbapenems (eg, imipenem, meropenem) are also effective.
