This patient with breast adenocarcinoma underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy and now has a
suspected catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). Cytotoxic chemotherapy induces
apoptosis in dividing cells by preventing mitosis or damaging DNA. Although this destroys
rapidly dividing tumor cells, it also kills healthy cells that have high turnover rates, such as hair
follicle cells, gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and bone marrow stem cells.

Therefore, one of the most common adverse effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy is
myelosuppression, which frequently leads to pancytopenia 10-14 days after treatment.
Reductions in erythrocytes can impede functional status, and reduction in platelets can cause
bleeding. However, the most serious aspect of myelosuppression is the destruction of
granulocyte precursors, leading to increased infection risk due to neutropenia (typically
defined as an absolute neutrophil count <1,000/mm:).
