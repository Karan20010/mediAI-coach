Actinomyces are anaerobic, gram-positive bacilli that have a branching, filamentous growth
pattern similar to the mycelial form of fungi (hence their "fungus-like" name). They exist as
normal commensals of the human gastrointestinal tract and rarely cause illness. However,
introduction of the bacteria into the submucosa during a mechanical trauma (eg, tooth
extraction) can sometimes lead to invasive disease, particularly when the wound is
associated with low oxygen tension (ie, due to necrosis or infection).

Infections with Actinomyces most commonly involve the cervicofacial region. The bacteria
grow slowly and without regard to tissue planes, resulting in a chronic, nontender, indurated
perimandibular mass that enlarges over time and evolves into multiple abscesses and
draining sinus tracts. A characteristic finding is the presence of sulfur granules, yellow-
orange granules in pus that resemble (but do not contain) sulfur. Sulfur granules are
intertwined Actinomyces filaments mixed with necrotic tissue.
