Educational objective:

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), one of the most common causes of early
neonatal sepsis, is typically identified by the presence of a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis
when plated on blood agar. It is also identified by the production of CAMP factor, which
enhances beta-hemolysis by particular strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
