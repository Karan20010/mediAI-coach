Gram-positive organisms have cell walls composed primarily of a thick peptidoglycan layer and
teichoic acid. However, additional cell wall components are often present that contribute to
virulence, motility, or the ability to adhere to epithelial surfaces. For instance, the cell wall of
group A streptococcus (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes) is studded with M protein,
a virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis, prevents complement binding, and aids in
epithelial attachment.

M protein is an alpha-helical coiled-coil protein that shares epitopes and structural homology
with other alpha-helical coiled-coil proteins such as tropomyosin and myosin. In some
patients, the protective antibodies against M protein that develop in S pyogenes acute infection
may cross-react with myosin epitopes in the heart and cause rheumatic carditis.
