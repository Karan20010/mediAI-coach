This patient developed fever, headache, myalgia, and a maculopapular rash while camping in
the Appalachian Mountains, raising strong suspicion for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
(RMSF). The causative pathogen is Rickettsia rickettsii, a weakly gram-negative, obligate
intracellular bacterium. Transmission occurs following a tick bite from specific tick vectors
(eg, American dog tick) present in the eastern and south-central United States and
mountainous regions west of the Mississippi River.

R rickettsii moves from the tick salivary glands to the human host after 6-12 hours of
attachment. The pathogen enters vascular endothelial cells via endocytosis and subsequently
lyses the endosome using specific virulence factors. It then replicates in the cytosol and
nucleus of the host cell and spreads rapidly to adjacent cells via filopodia, leading to a
lymphohistiocytic vasculitis.
