Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections are common in patients with advanced AIDS.
The bacterium often spreads through the bloodstream and reticuloendothelial system and
causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea), lymphadenopathy,
and hepatosplenomegaly. Diagnosis is often made on blood culture or bone marrow aspirate
(intracellular acid-fast bacteria that are not Mycobacterium tuberculosis).
