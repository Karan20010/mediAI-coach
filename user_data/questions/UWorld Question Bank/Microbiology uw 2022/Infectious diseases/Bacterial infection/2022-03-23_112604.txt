(Choice B) Topical antimicrobial ointments do not reduce the rate of CVC-related infections
and are associated with increased risk of antimicrobial resistance and Candida colonization.

(Choice D) Oral or parenteral antibiotics have not been found to reduce the incidence of
CVC-related infections. In addition, the prophylactic use of vancomycin has been found to
increase the risk of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus.

(Choice E) Catheter replacement at scheduled intervals does not reduce infection rates.
Routine replacement of CVCs is not necessary for functional catheters with no evidence of
infection.
