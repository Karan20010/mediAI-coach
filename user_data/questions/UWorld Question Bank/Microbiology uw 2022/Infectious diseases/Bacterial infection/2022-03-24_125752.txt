Typhoid fever is a life-threatening infection caused by Salmonella Typhi or Paratyphi. These
gram-negative, enteric pathogens reside only in the gastrointestinal tract of humans (Choice
B). Transmission occurs via the fecal-oral route, primarily due to ingestion of food or water
contaminated by human feces. Therefore, most cases arise in the developing world where

sanitation is poor. Travelers who have not been vaccinated (with typhoid vaccine) are at risk

and may return clinically ill.
