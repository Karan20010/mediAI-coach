(Choice B) Escherichia coli causes many forms of gastroenteritis, including enterotoxin-
mediated watery diarrhea (enterotoxigenic), Shiga toxin—mediated hemorrhagic colitis
(enterohemorrhagic), and invasive colitis (enteroinvasive). Although this pathogen is a gram-
negative enteric rod, it is oxidase negative and not described as curved.

(Choice C) Nontyphoidal Sa/monella (eg, S serovar Enteritidis) is a common cause of
bacterial gastroenteritis. This enteroinvasive pathogen frequently causes self-limited
abdominal pain, fever, and watery diarrhea; bloody diarrhea is less common but can occur.
However, Salmonella is oxidase negative and not described as curved.

(Choice D) Shigella is a highly virulent bacterium that is often transmitted via the fecal-oral
route in day care centers or other areas of communal habituation. It causes inflammatory
colitis with fever, abdominal pain, and mucoid, bloody, and/or watery diarrhea. However,
Shigella is oxidase negative and is not described as curved.

(Choice E) Vibrio cholerae is a curved, oxidase-positive, gram-negative enteric rod and can
therefore occasionally be misidentified as a Campylobacter species. However, V cholerae
causes massive watery diarrhea (due to cholera toxin) that is noninflammatory (ie, no fecal
leukocytes or erythrocytes).
