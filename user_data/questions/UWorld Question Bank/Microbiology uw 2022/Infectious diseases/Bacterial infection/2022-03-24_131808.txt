Educational objective:

Escherichia coli is the most common cause of urinary tract infection (UTI) in both healthy
adults and elderly patients. E coli is part of the normal gastrointestinal flora, and special
adhesive proteins (pili) allow some strains to colonize and ascend the urinary tract, causing
UTI, pyelonephritis, and bacteremia/sepsis. UTIs are the most common cause of E coli
bacteremia.
