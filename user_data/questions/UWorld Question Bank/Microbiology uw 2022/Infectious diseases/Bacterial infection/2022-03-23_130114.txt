Educational objective:

Pathogenesis of Escherichia coli sepsis involves the release of lipopolysaccharide (ie,
endotoxin) from bacterial cells. Lipid Ais the major virulence factor of lipopolysaccharides that
induces macrophages to release cytokines (eg, IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), leading to

the manifestations of septic shock (eg, end-organ dysfunction).
