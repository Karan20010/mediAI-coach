lymphocytosis.

(Choice A) Acute bacterial pneumonia (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) presents with fever
and productive cough; it is associated with massive migration of neutrophils from the
bloodstream into the alveoli. In contrast, pertussis is associated with reduced neutrophil influx
due to elaboration of pertussis toxin and adenylate cyclase toxin.

(Choice B) Endotoxins are found in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and can
cause septic shock (eg, hypotension, fever) when released into the bloodstream. Pertussis is
noninvasive; disease manifestations are mediated by exotoxins, not endotoxins.

(Choice C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is marked by interferon-gamma—mediated
macrophage activation, which leads to the formation of protective granulomas and the killing of
the bacteria. M tuberculosis is an acid-fast bacterium; it is not gram negative.

(Choice D) Measles infection begins in the respiratory epithelium and spreads via the
bloodstream to reticuloendothelial cells. Although this unvaccinated patient is at increased risk
of infection, the cough in measles is associated with high fever and conjunctivitis and followed
by a characteristic erythematous, maculopapular rash.
