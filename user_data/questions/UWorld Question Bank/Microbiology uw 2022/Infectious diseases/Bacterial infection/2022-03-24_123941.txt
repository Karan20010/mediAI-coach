Educational objective:

Typhoidal strains of Salmonella contain a capsular antigen (Vi) and other virulence factors that
inhibit neutrophil phagocytosis, neutrophil recruitment, and macrophage-mediated destruction.
Therefore, typhoidal Salmonella undergoes extensive replication in macrophages and is able
to spread through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread

systemic disease (typhoid fever).
