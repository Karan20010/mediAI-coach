Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is characterized by the formation of highly vascular lesions in
the skin and other organs due to infection with the small, gram-negative bacterium Bartonella
henselae. The major reservoir for this organism is domesticated cats, and transmission to
humans primarily occurs after a cat scratch or bite. Patients with intact immunity who are
exposed to B henselae often develop cat-scratch disease (regional lymphadenopathy), but
those with advanced AIDS are at risk for the more severe clinical syndrome of BA.

Patients with BA develop violaceous, cutaneous lesions that are highly vascular. Lesions
form over weeks or months and are typically associated with fever, weight loss, and other
constitutional symptoms. As these lesions are similar to those seen in Kaposi sarcoma, tissue
testing for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is typically performed (HHV-8 testing will be positive
in Kaposi sarcoma and negative in BA). Biopsy with histopathology confirms the diagnosis
and usually reveals large endothelial cells forming small vascular channels surrounded by a
mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Modified silver stain can also identify the organism.
