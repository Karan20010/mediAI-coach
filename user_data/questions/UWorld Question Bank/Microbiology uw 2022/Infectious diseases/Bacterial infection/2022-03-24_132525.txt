Spores of Clostridium perfringens, a gram-positive bacillus responsible for ~95% of cases of
gas gangrene (clostridial myonecrosis), are abundant in soil and can inoculate penetrating
injury sites. On entering the host, the spores germinate in the anaerobic environment into
vegetative cells, which produce a phospholipase toxin that attacks cell membranes.

Extensive tissue damage, necrosis, and reduced blood supply to the affected area result, with
the disease spreading in the enlarging anaerobic environment. The organism rapidly
metabolizes carbohydrates, producing gas that can sometimes be felt on examination
(crepitus) and may often be visualized on radiographs (helping to distinguish gas gangrene
from other necrotizing infections). Treatment involves antibiotics and emergent debridement.
However, prognosis is poor even with prompt therapy, and tissue loss is often considerable.

C perfringens can also cause late-onset food poisoning that is characterized by transient
watery diarrhea. This gastroenteritis is caused by a toxin formed when large quantities of
clostridial spores are ingested. The spores germinate in the digestive tract and then begin to
elaborate toxin, which explains the disease's delayed onset. This is in contrast to early-onset
food poisoning caused by the preformed toxins of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
