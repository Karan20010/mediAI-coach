Educational objective:

Patients with neutropenic fever (ie, temperature >38.3 C [>101 F] and absolute neutrophil
count <500/mms) are at risk for overwhelming bacterial infections. The majority of severe
infections that cause rapid clinical deterioration (eg, 4 hours) are caused by gram-negative

organisms that produce endotoxins.
