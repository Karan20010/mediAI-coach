Educational objective:

Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is primarily contracted after eating undercooked
ground beef. EHEC produces Shiga toxin, which causes hemorrhagic colitis and can lead to
hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by acute renal failure,
thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia; children age <10 are at greatest

risk.
