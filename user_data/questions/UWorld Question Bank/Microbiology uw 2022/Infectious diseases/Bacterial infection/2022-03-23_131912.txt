Systemic chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cancer cells but also damages healthy cells

with high turnover rates, particularly epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract and stem cells

in the bone marrow. Injury to these cells dramatically increases the risk of infection due to:

Mucositis: Damage to rapidly dividing epithelial cells of the digestive tract creates
breaches in the mucosal barrier that allow endogenous bacterial flora (commensal
organisms) to penetrate and enter the bloodstream. Gram-negative enteric bacilli, such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Gram-positive skin organisms, such as Staphylococcus
epidermidis and S aureus, are most likely to invade.

Neutropenia: Damage to rapidly dividing granulopoietic cells reduces the circulating
neutrophil count. Because neutrophils serve as front-line defense against bacterial and
fungal pathogens, commensal pathogens that penetrate the mucosal/cutaneous barrier
cannot be contained and subsequently spread to the bloodstream and deeper tissues.
Neutropenic patients have weak inflammatory responses, and fever is often the only sign
of infection (neutropenic fever).
