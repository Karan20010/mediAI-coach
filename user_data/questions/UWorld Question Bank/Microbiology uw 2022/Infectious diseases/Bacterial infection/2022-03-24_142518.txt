This patient with fever, tachycardia, and altered mental status has sepsis; the presence of
leukocytes, nitrites, leukocyte esterase, and bacteria in the urine make a urinary tract
infection (UTI) the most likely infectious source.

The pathogenic organism can be determined based on microbiological features. For instance,
MacConkey agar is selective for gram-negative rods because gram-positive bacteria are
unable to grow on this culture medium. Some gram-negative rods can ferment lactose,
causing colonies to turn pink, and both Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae are fast
lactose fermenters. The ability to convert tryptophan to indole (ie, indole-positive) can further
differentiate bacteria, and the indole-positivity of E coli distinguishes it from E cloacae (Choice
A).

Among the organisms listed, this patient with lactose-fermenting, indole-positive bacterial
growth on MacConkey agar has infection due to E coli, the most common cause of UTI.
Women are more likely than men to develop UTIs due to a shorter distance between the anus
and urethra, and fecal incontinence increases the risk of introducing gastrointestinal flora such
as E coli into the urinary tract. Other predisposing factors for E coli UTl—particularly in older
women—include diabetes, urinary retention or incontinence, and instrumentation of the urethra
(eg, intermittent catheterization), all of which are present in this patient.
