Streptococcus pneumoniae, a gram-positive lancet-shaped diplococcus, causes life-
threatening invasive infections such as pneumonia and meningitis (eg, fever, vomiting,
bulging fontanelle). Its major virulence factor is a polysaccharide capsule that protects the
bacterium from phagocytosis and opsonization. Antigenic variation in the polysaccharide
capsule differentiates >93 S pneumoniae serotypes. Immunity against one provides little or no
protection against others. Therefore, infection with a new serotype typically leads to
weeks/months of nasopharyngeal colonization and increased risk of invasive infection.

Vaccination against the most common and virulent S pneumoniae serotypes is recommended
for children and high-risk adults to reduce colonization and invasive disease. In children, a 13-
valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide-conjugate vaccines (PCV 13) is typically
administered; this vaccine contains polysaccharides from 13 serotypes conjugated to an
immunogenic carrier protein (nontoxic recombinant diphtheria toxin) to improve
immunogenicity.

Although vaccination creates protective antibodies against included polysaccharide antigens, it
provides little or no protection against strains not in the vaccine; therefore, invasive disease
with a nonvaccinated serotype can still occur.
