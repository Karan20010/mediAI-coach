Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a non-sporeâ€”forming, gram-positive bacillus that is
transmitted primarily via aerosolized droplets. Nontoxigenic strains are minimally infectious;
toxigenic strains are virulent and cause the clinical syndrome of diphtheria. Conversion from
nontoxigenic to toxigenic C diphtheriae occurs due to infection with a lysogenic
bacteriophage called Corynephage beta. This phage inserts the tox gene into the C
diphtheriae genome, which results in the bacterial expression of the diphtheria AB toxin.
Diphtheria toxin irreversibly halts protein synthesis due to ADP-ribosylation of elongation
factor-2 and causes severe local (eg, pseudomembranous pharyngitis) and systemic (eg,

myocarditis, neuritis) effects.
