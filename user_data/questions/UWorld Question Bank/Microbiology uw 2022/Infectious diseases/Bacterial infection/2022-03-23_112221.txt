Educational objective:

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a leading cause of atypical pneumonia. Because this pathogen
lacks a cell wall, it does not show up on Gram stain and cannot be treated with beta-lactam
antibiotics. Protein synthesis inhibitors (eg, macrolides, tetracycline) are the treatment of

choice.
