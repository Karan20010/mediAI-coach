Educational objective:

Group A streptococcus (GAS) should be suspected in those with acute-onset sore throat,
exudative tonsillopharyngitis, and no evidence of viral symptoms (eg, coryza, cough,
conjunctivitis). In-office throat swab with rapid antigen detection testing (immunoassay for
GAS antigens) can provide on-site microbiologic confirmation, allowing for early initiation of

treatment.
