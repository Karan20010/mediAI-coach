Staphylococcus aureus can cause right-sided endocarditis in intravenous drug users
(IVDUs). In patients other than IVDUs, S aureus disseminates from a primary disease process
(eg, abscess, infected central line) and moves by hematogenous spread to the endocardium.
S aureus settles on the valve leaflets due to blood flow turbulence at these sites. S aureus
can cause perforations in the heart valves, rupture the chordae tendineae, and send septic
emboli to the lung (with right heart endocarditis) or to the brain and systemic circulation (with
left heart endocarditis). This patient with fever is an IVDU with a holosystolic murmur that
increases with inspiration (likely tricuspid regurgitation) and multiple lung opacities (likely
septic emboli). She likely has S aureus endocarditis.
