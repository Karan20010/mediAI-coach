(Choices A and B) Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium species (eg, C diphtheriae) are

also gram-positive rods. However, tetanus usually presents with hypertonicity and

spasms, while diphtheria typically causes severe pharyngitis; neonatal infection with either is
uncommon in resource-rich countries due to transplacental transfer of neutralizing antibodies
it from immunized mothers. In addition, neither pathogen causes early-onset neonatal sepsis.

13 (Choices C and E) Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus)
are the most common causes of neonatal sepsis. However, E coli is a gram-negative rod, and

16 S agalactiae appears as gram-positive cocci in chains.

17

48 (Choice F) Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive diplococcus and a common cause
18 of bacteremia and meningitis in infants age 21 month.

23 Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive rod associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis via

25

3B susceptible patients, including neonates, older adults, pregnant women, and

27 immunocompromised individuals.
