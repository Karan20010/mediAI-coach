Acute phase reactants (APRs) are proteins whose serum concentrations change by 225%
during periods of inflammation. Several APRs have diagnostic and prognostic utility and can
be interpreted on the basis of serum concentrations:

¢ Positive APRs (serum levels rise in acute inflammatory states) include fibrinogen, C-
reactive protein, ferritin, hepcidin, ceruloplasmin, haptoglobin, von Willebrand factor, and
complement. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (the time required for erythrocytes to
settle from suspension) is an indirect measure of positive APRs.

¢ Negative APRs (serum levels fall in acute inflammatory states) include albumin,
transferrin, and transthyretin (prealbumin).

Procalcitonin, a precursor of calcitonin produced by monocytes and the C cells of the thyroid,
is a unique APR that has positive and negative properties. Levels rise in response to
bacterial toxins and fall in response to viral infections, and therefore levels can suggest the
etiology of community-acquired pneumonia. This patient has lobar pneumonia manifesting
with fever, rust-colored sputum, and neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis, likely due to a
bacterial infection (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Therefore, procalcitonin levels are
expected to be elevated.
