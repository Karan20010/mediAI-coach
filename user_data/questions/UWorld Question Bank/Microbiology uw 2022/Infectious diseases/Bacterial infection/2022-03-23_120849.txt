Catscratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae, a gram-negative coccobacillus
transmitted by a cat scratch or bite. Patients commonly present with tender lymphadenopathy
proximal to the inoculation site (eg, axillary, epitrochlear lymph nodes). Lymph node
histopathology often shows necrotizing granulomas and stellate-shaped microabscesses.
