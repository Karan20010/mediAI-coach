Educational objective:

The major virulence factor of Streptococcus pyogenes is M protein, an alpha-helical coiled-coil
protein that shares structural homology with tropomyosin and myosin. It extends from the cell
wall and prevents phagocytosis, inhibits complement binding, and mediates bacterial
adherence. Antibodies against M protein form shortly after acute infection and may cross-
react with epitopes on myosin, leading to rheumatic carditis.
