(Choice B) Patients with hemochromatosis are at increased risk for fulminant Vibrio vulnificus
infections (the organism is dependent on free iron for growth). Although V vulnificus can cause
rapid-onset sepsis and bullous skin lesions, it is a gram-negative bacterium. In addition, most

infections occur due to shellfish consumption or wound contamination with seawater.

(Choice C) Indwelling vascular catheters increase the risk for candidemia, which can cause
sepsis, abscesses, and pustular skin lesions on an erythematous base.

(Choice D) Multiple myeloma impairs lymphocyte function and reduces the ability of plasma
cells to generate normal immunoglobulin, which increases risk of infection. Pneumonia due to
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae and urinary infections due to
Escherichia coli are most common.

(Choice E) Recent antibiotic use increases the risk of C difficile infection, which usually
presents with diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain.
