vaccination, which generates neutralizing IgG antibodies against the binding component (B
subunit) of the diphtheria exotoxin. The vaccine inhibits toxin-mediated cell damage and also
reduces the competitive advantage of toxigenic strains, thereby reducing toxigenic carriage
rates within the population.

(Choice A) CD8 lymphocytes destroy cells infected with intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses)
as well as cells damaged by cancer. They do not bind to and eliminate circulating exotoxins.

(Choices B and E) IgM opsonization and complement fixation are important mechanisms for
combating extracellular infections, particularly with encapsulated organisms. Although
vaccination may stimulate an IgM response, long-term protection is primarily mediated by IgG
antibodies.

(Choice C) IgAis the primary immunoglobulin found on mucosal surfaces and in secretions.
It does not have significant opsonizing or complement-activating properties. Instead, it
prevents infection by inhibiting bacterial interaction with epithelial cells (eg, attachment,
invasion). IgA antibodies may help prevent diphtheria colonization. However, C diphtheriae
does not have a polysaccharide capsule.

Educational objective:

Toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produce diphtheria toxin, which irreversibly AGINEUS
