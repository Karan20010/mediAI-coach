Educational objective:

Lyme disease should be suspected in any individual from an endemic area who develops
erythema migrans, a slowly expanding annular lesion with central clearing (bull's-eye rash).
Most cases are not pruritic or painful, but patients sometimes have systemic symptoms (eg,

fever, myalgia, headache).
