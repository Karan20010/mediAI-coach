Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular gram-positive bacillus that can multiply at
refrigerated temperatures in both anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions. It is an
important cause of foodborne illness; outbreaks are frequently associated with consumption of
contaminated food products (eg, processed meats, soft cheeses, raw fruits & vegetables).

Healthy patients who ingest high inoculums of Listeria are at risk for febrile gastroenteritis.
Invasive infections such as sepsis and meningoencephalitis are primarily seen in patients
with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS, malignancy, extremes of age, pregnancy).
Pregnant women are at greatest risk in the third trimester and often present with flu-like
symptoms and diarrhea. Infection during pregnancy can cause preterm labor, neonatal
sepsis, or granulomatosis infantiseptica (ie, infant with papular & pustular skin lesions,
widespread abscesses/granulomas).
