should be raised in any individual from an endemic area who develops a characteristic EM
rash.

(Choice A) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) can sometimes cause a fixed
drug reaction, which is marked by the activation of cytotoxic T cells in a particular location
within the dermis. Although patients frequently develop an annular rash, it is usually a dusky
red plaque with no central clearing.

(Choice B) Tinea corporis can sometimes be spread through contact with fomites (eg, gym
equipment). Although this fungal infection often causes an annular lesion with central clearing
that spreads outward, the advancing edge has raised borders, and the lesions are usually
intensely pruritic.

(Choice C) Atype 1 hypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to an insect bite usually arises within
minutes and is marked by an edematous lesion that is intensely pruritic. This patient with 2
days of progressive rash that is nonpruritic is unlikely to be experiencing an allergic reaction.

(Choice E) Streptococcal lymphangitis is marked by the formation of erythematous streaks up
the lymphatic channel. The formation of an annular lesion with central clearing would be
atypical.
