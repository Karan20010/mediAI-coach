hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and leukopenia. Later, ulceration of Peyer patches (lymphoid
aggregations in the small intestine submucosa) can result in gastrointestinal bleeding or
intestinal perforation. Antibiotic treatment is required to prevent complications and death.

(Choice A) Malaria is transmitted by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito and typically
causes paroxysmal fever with nonspecific symptoms (eg, chills, fatigue, headache, myalgias).
However, the fever is almost always associated with tachycardia (not bradycardia), and
peripheral blood smear will usually demonstrate the parasite and/or signs of red blood cell
lysis.

(Choice D) Meningococcal meningitis is transmitted by aerosolized droplets from a carrier or
infected patient and is associated with rapid-onset confusion, sepsis, hypotension, and a
petechial/purpuric rash.

(Choice E) Treponema pallidum, the spirochete that causes syphilis, is transmitted sexually.
Secondary syphilis is usually characterized by a widespread maculopapular rash that involves
the palms and soles, generalized lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms such as
fever, headache, and myalgias. This patient's pulse-temperature dissociation, limited rash,
and lack of adenopathy make syphilis less likely than typhoid fever.
