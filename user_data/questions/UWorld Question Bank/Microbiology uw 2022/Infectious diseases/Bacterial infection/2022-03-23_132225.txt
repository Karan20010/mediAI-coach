Glomerulonephritis is associated with prior streptococcal pharyngeal or skin infection; acute
rheumatic fever is associated with prior streptococcal pharyngitis but not skin infection.
Streptococci are catalase-negative, staphylococci are catalase-positive. Streptococcus
pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) is B-hemolytic, bacitracin-susceptible, and pyrrolidonyl
arylamidase-positive. Streptococcus pneumoniae is bile-soluble and optochin-susceptible.
