(Choice A) Certain virulent enteric bacteria (eg, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae)
release AB exotoxins that activate electrolyte transport. These toxins have 5 B subunits
responsible for cell binding and toxin endocytosis and 1 A subunit that stimulates a G protein to
increase intracellular cAMP concentrations. As a result, active efflux of sodium and chloride
ions occurs, and the subsequent cell water loss into the gut lumen leads to watery diarrhea
and dehydration.

(Choice B) Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin that blocks exocytosis of acetylcholine-containing
presynaptic vesicles from peripheral nerve terminals, causing cranial and peripheral nerve
palsies, muscle weakness, and respiratory paralysis. Tetanus toxin inhibits the release of the
inhibitory neurotransmitters gamma-aminobutyric acid and glycine. Classic manifestations of
tetanus include muscle spasms and autonomic hyperactivity.

(Choice C) Clostridium perfringens releases a cytolytic toxin (alpha-toxin, or phospholipase
C) that degrades cell membrane phospholipids, causing cell destruction.

(Choice E) Superantigens (eg, staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock toxins) bind
nonspecifically to T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on
antigen-presenting cells, leading to widespread T cell stimulation and inflammation. However,
they are classically implicated in toxic shock syndrome related to tampon use or nasal packing,
