(Choice A) Chronic malabsorption can occur with Giardia infection due to blunting of the
small intestinal villi. Transmission is via contaminated water and leads to watery, foul-smelling
diarrhea. However, Sa/monella gastroenteritis is usually self-limited and does not result in
chronic malabsorption.

(Choices B and D) Gastroenteritis caused by Shigella, a nonlactose-fermenting, oxidase-
negative, gram-negative bacilli, is associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
However, patients typically have high fever, tenesmus (ie, painful urge to pass stool), and
bloody/mucoid diarrhea. Gastroenteritis due to Shiga toxin—producing Escherichia coli (which
is transmitted by contaminated, undercooked beef) can also be complicated by HUS, but
similar to Shigella, the diarrhea would be bloody. In addition, E coli is lactose fermenting.

(Choice C) Guillain-Barré syndrome is often preceded by Campylobacter jejuni infection.
Although C jejuni is typically transmitted by poultry and can cause a clinical illness similar to
Salmonella, the organism is oxidase positive, and stools are often bloody.

Educational objective:
Nontyphoidal Sa/monella causes gastroenteritis that classically causes self-limited fever,
vomiting, and diarrhea. Invasive disease can occur, including spread to the long bones
