This child has impetigo, a superficial bacterial infection that most commonly develops on the
face or extremities in children. Patients usually develop mildly itchy or painful erythematous
papules and pustules that later erupt, forming a honey-colored crusting. The most common
pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus followed by group A Streptococcus (GAS, S pyogenes).

Treatment of localized impetigo is with topical antibiotics (eg, mupirocin), and most patients
have no long-term sequelae. However, a minority of patients may develop poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis (PSGN) several weeks after impetigo caused by GAS (as indicated by
this patient's Gram stain showing gram-positive cocci in chains). Renal damage is caused
by immune complex deposition as well as complement activation, leading to a massive
inflammatory response that damages the glomerular basement membrane.

Symptoms of PSGN range from asymptomatic, microscopic hematuria to gross hematuria and
nephrotic-range proteinuria. In addition to tea- or cola-colored urine, patients may develop
periorbital/facial swelling, generalized edema, and hypertension. Laboratory evaluation
typically reveals elevated creatinine and decreased complement C3 level.
