Educational Objective:

Active tuberculosis is never treated with drug monotherapy due to the fast emergence of
mycobacterial antibiotic resistance from rapid, selective gene mutations. Isoniazid
monotherapy may be used for patients who have a positive PPD and a negative chest x-ray
(ie, no evidence of clinical disease).
