(Choice A) Fluoroquinolones prevent DNA gyrase and topoisomerase from unwinding

9 bacterial double-stranded circular DNA. Fluoroquinolones can be used to treat typhoid fever, a
Salmonella infection that typically occurs in individuals who travel to developing nations.

iB Symptoms include a step-wise fever, salmon-colored rose spots on the trunk, and intestinal

14 bleeding/perforation.

(Choice B) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole inhibits bacterial replication by blocking 2
v7 successive steps in bacterial folate metabolism: Sulfamethoxazole competes with para-
aminobenzoic acid in the synthesis of dihydrofolic acid, and trimethoprim inhibits dihydrofolate

+ 20 reductase.
21
+ 2 (Choice D) Azole medications inhibit fungal ergosterol synthesis, which disrupts fungal cell
= membranes. Itraconazole can be used to treat pulmonary histoplasmosis, which usually
28 causes subacute pneumonia with hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
26
27 (Choice E) Penicillin medications inhibit peptidoglycan cross-linking, which disrupts bacterial

(spirochetal) cell membranes. Penicillin is the first-line therapy for syphilis, a spirochetal
+ 30 infection that can present with fever and a diffuse, symmetric maculopapular rash that involves
the palms and soles (secondary syphilis). However, patients typically have a mild (not high)

33 fever and diffuse lymphadenopathy. ctivate V
