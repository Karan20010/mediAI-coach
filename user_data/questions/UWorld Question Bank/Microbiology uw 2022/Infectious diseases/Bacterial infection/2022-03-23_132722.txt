(Choices A and C) Gram-negative cocci (eg, Moraxella in pairs) and rods (eg, Klebsiella in
pairs or short chains) are rare causes of epiglottitis. In addition, associated bacteremia is far
more likely when Hib is the causative pathogen due to its highly virulent capsule.

(Choices D and E) Gram-positive organisms (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae in chains,
Staphylococcus aureus in clusters) are less common causes of epiglottitis. Although the
number of epiglottitis cases caused by these organisms (particularly S pneumoniae) has
increased since widespread vaccination against Hib, the combined strains of H influenzae still
occur more frequently than any other organism.
