This patient has necrotizing fasciitis ("flesh-eating disease"), a severe soft tissue infection
characterized by fulminant tissue necrosis and high mortality. The condition is often
polymicrobial, but monomicrobial infection can occur with Streptococcus pyogenes,
Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens. S pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) is
a gram-positive cocci that is coagulase negative, catalase negative, and pyrrolidonyl
arylamidase (PYR) positive. It also forms small colonies with a wide zone of beta-hemolysis
and is sensitive to bacitracin, which has been widely replaced by the PYR test.

S pyogenes can be transmitted through wounds and spreads rapidly to the deep layers of the
skin and fascia due to production of hyaluronidase and streptokinase (converts plasminogen
to plasmin). M protein is expressed on the surface and allows the bacteria to evade
phagocytosis by preventing activation of the alternative complement pathway. The bacterium
also secretes hemolysins O and S (cytotoxins that cause hemolysis) and pyrogenic exotoxins
(superantigens that result in tissue injury and septic shock).

Sudden-onset, severe pain and swelling are typically present at a site of trauma or recent
surgery. Patients quickly become hypotensive and develop septic shock. Necrotizing fasciitis
is treated with aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue plus empiric broad-
spectrum antibiotics due to the high incidence of polymicrobial infection.
