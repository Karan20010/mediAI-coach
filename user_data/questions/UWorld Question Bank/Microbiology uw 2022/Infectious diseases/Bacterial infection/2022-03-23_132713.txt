Educational objective:

Epiglottitis causes rapidly progressive respiratory distress and a swollen epiglottis ("thumbprint
sign") on lateral neck x-ray. The most common pathogen is Haemophilus influenzae (ie, type
b, nontypeable strains), a gram-negative coccobacillus that often causes concomitant
bacteremia.
