further evaluation, he reports a 15-Ib weight loss over the past four months. Sputum cultures
grow acid-fast bacilli that are susceptible to most antimycobacterial drugs in vitro. Isoniazid

monotherapy in this patient would most likely result in:

©) A. Bacteriocidal effect on only extracellular bacilli

©) B. Decreased transport protein expression on the cell surface
©) C. B-lactamase induction within bacterial cells

©) D. Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body
