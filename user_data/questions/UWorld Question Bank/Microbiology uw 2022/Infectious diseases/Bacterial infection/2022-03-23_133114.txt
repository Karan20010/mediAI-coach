Educational objective:

Streptococcus pneumoniae is virulent primarily due to a polysaccharide capsule. A conjugant
vaccine provides long-lasting immunity against serotypes in the vaccine but provides no
significant immunity against nonvaccinated serotypes. Therefore, infection can still occur due

to serotypes not covered by the vaccine.
