Bordetella pertussis, a small, gram-negative coccobacillus, spreads rapidly via airborne
droplets through communities with low rates of tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccination.
Infants and children are most susceptible and typically develop a mild cough and rhinorrhea
followed by several weeks of severe, paroxysmal cough, often with an inspiratory whoop
and posttussive vomiting.

Although the bacterium is largely noninvasive, B pertussis has several virulence factors (eg,
pili, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin) that allow it to strongly attach to respiratory
epithelium. After binding, it then releases inflammatory exotoxins, including:

Â¢ tracheal cytotoxin, which directly damages and destroys ciliated epithelial cells,
leading to a loss of airway clearance, subsequent microaspiration, and the development of
the characteristic paroxysmal cough.

pertussis toxin, which is an AB toxin that enters cells and activates adenylate cyclase,
leading to alterations in cellular signaling that inhibit phagocyte activity and can cause

lymphocytosis.
