(Choice A) Antibiotic use can promote diarrhea by altering the gut microbial milieu. This
alteration can lead to overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that can
cause profuse, watery diarrhea and life-threatening fulminant colitis. Therefore, increasing
antibiotic use would likely result in increased diarrheal illness and potential complications.

(Choice B) Serum sickness-like reactions are associated with certain infections (eg, hepatitis
B) and antibiotics (eg, penicillin). The development of circulating drug-specific immune
complexes may cause fever, rash, and arthritis. If penicillin was used more frequently, serum
sickness-like reactions would potentially increase, not decrease.

(Choice C) Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is the most common cause of
nephritic syndrome in children worldwide. It is caused by deposition of immune complexes in
glomeruli following pharyngitis or skin infections with group A Streptococcus. Although early
antibiotics are effective in preventing ARF, they have not been shown to reduce the risk of
PSGN.

(Choice E) Empiric use of potentially unnecessary antibiotics may cause an increase in
antibiotic resistance, thereby increasing the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics. For example,
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved from methicillin-sensitive S
aureus via alteration of the protein binding site for beta-lactam antibiotics. As a result, broad-
