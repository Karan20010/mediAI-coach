Isoniazid is an antimicrobial agent that is active only against mycobacteria. Its specificity is
derived from its inhibition of mycolic acid synthesis. Mycolic acids form long branched-
chain fatty acids in the outer portion of the mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall; they are
essential for proper cell wall structure and virulence factor synthesis (eg, sulfatides, wax D,
cord factor). If mycobacteria are unable to synthesize mycolic acids, they cannot create
proper cell walls or divide to form new cells. Mycolic acids in the cell wall cause mycobacteria
to be acid-fast as they retain the carbolfuchsin dye and resist decoloration by an acid-alcohol

decolorizing agent.
