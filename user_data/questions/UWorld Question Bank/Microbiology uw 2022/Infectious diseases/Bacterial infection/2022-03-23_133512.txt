This hospitalized patient's fever and diarrhea a few days after antibiotic initiation are
concerning for Clostridium difficile infection. All hospitalized patients require standard
precautions, including handwashing before and after patient contact, proper disposal of
cleaning instruments and linens, and occasional use of gowns and gloves as required (eg,
contact with body fluids).

However, cases of suspected or proven C difficile infection require additional contact
precautions, including handwashing with soap and water (alcohol-based hand sanitizers do
not kill the spores), gown for any patient contact, and nonsterile gloves that should be
changed after contact with contaminated secretions. Gloves alone would not be sufficient
