Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called Streptococcus pyogenes, is the leading cause of
bacterial pharyngitis in children and adolescents. Manifestations include abrupt-onset
fever and sore throat; patients may also have nausea, vomiting, and headache. Examination
often reveals exudative tonsillopharyngitis and enlarged tonsils. An alternate diagnosis should
be suspected in those with manifestations of viral illness (eg, coryza, conjunctivitis, cough,
hoarseness, mouth ulcers).

Patients with suspected GAS pharyngitis require microbiologic testing prior to initiation of
antimicrobials. Throat swab samples are collected in-office and are subsequently evaluated
by the following:

¢ Rapid antigen detection testing (RADT) — this immunoassay evaluates for GAS
antigens and provides rapid, in-office results. However, due to the test's limited

sensitivity, patients with negative RADT require throat culture to confirm they do not have
the organism.

¢ Throat culture — samples are plated on blood agar and evaluated for beta-hemolysis
within 48 hours. GAS is beta-hemolytic due to the expression of cytolysins (eg,
streptolysin O), which create a broad zone of complete hemolysis (not incomplete
hemolysis) around plated colonies (Choice D).

Patients with positive RADT or throat culture require antibiotic therapy (eg, amoxicillin) to
prevent complications of GAS (eg, rheumatic fever), limit transmission to others, and reduce
duration/severity of symptoms.

Educational objective:
Group A streptococcus (GAS) should be suspected in those with acute-onset sore throat,
exudative tonsillopharyngitis, and no evidence of viral symptoms (eg, coryza, cough,
conjunctivitis). In-office throat swab with rapid antigen detection testing (immunoassay for
GAS antigens) can provide on-site microbiologic confirmation, allowing for early initiation of
treatment.
