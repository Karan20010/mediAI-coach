This child has acute-onset fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, findings suggestive of acute
bacterial gastroenteritis. Common causative organisms in bacterial gastroenteritis with
bloody diarrhea include Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Shigella, and Campylobacter.

Of the given choices, the most likely pathogen is Shigella sonnei, which is transmitted by
ingestion of contaminated food or water. S sonnei is also sometimes implicated in outbreaks
in community settings (eg, day care facilities) due to the low infectious dose required for
person-to-person spread.

Shigella gastroenteritis presents abruptly with high fever, abdominal cramping, and stools
that are initially watery before mucus and/or blood appears. Shigella preferentially involves
the rectosigmoid region (ie, left-sided abdominal tenderness), causing frequent episodes of
small-volume bloody/mucoid diarrhea. Nausea and vomiting are often absent but may occur,
and seizure is a severe, uncommon complication that can occur in children. Stool culture is

diagnostic.
