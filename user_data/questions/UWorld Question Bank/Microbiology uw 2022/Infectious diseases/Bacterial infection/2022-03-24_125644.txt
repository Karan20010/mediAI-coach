Haemophilus influenzae is a gram-negative coccobacillus that can be either encapsulated
(serotypes a-f) or unencapsulated (nontypeable). H influenzae type b (Hib) is the most
invasive strain due to its polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule, which inhibits
complement-mediated phagocytosis and allows it to invade tissues and survive in the
bloodstream.

During the first months of life, transient immunity to Hib is accomplished by IgG antibodies
acquired transplacentally from the mother while in utero. The Hib vaccine is administered
beginning at age 2 months to provide continued immunity. The immunization is composed of
PRP conjugated with a protein toxoid (eg, tetanus, diphtheria), which induces a T cellâ€”
dependent immune response. The production of opsonizing anticapsular antibodies by B-
lymphocytes allows for efficient phagocytosis of the bacterium. Without the protection from the
vaccine, this child is at risk for invasive disease caused by Hib, such as meningitis,
bacteremia, pneumonia, and epiglottitis.
