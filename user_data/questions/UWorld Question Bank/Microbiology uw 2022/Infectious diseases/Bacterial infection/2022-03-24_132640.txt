those with gastritis.

(Choice A) Patients with splenectomy are at much higher risk of fulminant infection with
encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and
Haemophilus influenzae. V cholerae is not encapsulated and not invasive; patients with
splenectomy are unlikely to be at greater risk.

(Choice C) Recent antibiotic use is a strong risk factor for Clostridium difficile colitis, which
typically manifests with watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and low-grade fever. C difficile is a
spore-forming, toxin-producing, gram-positive organism.

(Choice D) Patients with chronic liver disease are at increased risk for severe disease with
Vibrio vulnificus, which can cause watery diarrhea. However, the ingestion of this pathogen
usually leads to severe, rapid-onset sepsis in susceptible patients. In addition, V vulnificus is
more likely to cause wound infections than gastroenteritis.

(Choice E) Patients with cystic fibrosis are at high risk for infections with Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, an oxidase-positive, gram-negative rod. This pathogen is a common cause of
pneumonia in this population; it does not cause gastroenteritis outbreaks.
