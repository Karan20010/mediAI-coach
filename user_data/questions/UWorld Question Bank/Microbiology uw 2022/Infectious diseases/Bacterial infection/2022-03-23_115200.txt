Vibrio vulnificus is a curved, gram-negative, free-living bacterium that grows in brackish
coastal water and marine environments. This bacterium is found in greatest concentrations in
the summer months, comprising as much as 8% of the total bacteria in some areas. V
vulnificus infections are primarily acquired through the consumption of raw oysters (which
concentrate the bacterium) or wound contamination during recreational water activities or the
handling of raw seafood. Most patients who become ill have liver disease (eg, alcohol-
associated cirrhosis, viral hepatitis); those with iron overload (eg, hemochromatosis) are at
particularly high risk as free iron acts as an exponential growth catalyst for the bacterium.

Healthy patients with V vulnificus wound contamination usually develop a mild cellulitis, but
those with iron overload or liver disease are at high risk for rapidly progressive necrotizing
fasciitis with hemorrhagic, bullous lesions and septic shock (eg, hypotension, elevated lactic
acid level). In these patients, urgent antibiotics, surgery, and blood pressure support are
usually required to prevent death.
