Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which an abnormality in the CF
transmembrane conductance regulator results in the accumulation of thick, viscous mucus in
multiple organ systems. In particular, inspissated airway secretions block the respiratory tract
and impair mucociliary clearance, leading to bacterial colonization and chronic, recurrent
sinopulmonary infections.

CF pulmonary exacerbations are characterized by a decline in lung function (ie, forced
expiratory volume in 1 sec) and new or worsening cough, shortness of breath, or sputum
production. Infection and subsequent airway inflammation are typically responsible for the
acute change in respiratory status, and common bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus
aureus, nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With
progressive disease, however, patients are also at risk for colonization with Burkholderia
cepacia complex, a fastidious gram-negative bacterium that is often difficult to eradicate and
associated with increased morbidity and mortality.
