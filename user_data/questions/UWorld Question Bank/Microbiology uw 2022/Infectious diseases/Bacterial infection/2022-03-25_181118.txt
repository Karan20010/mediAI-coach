This patient from Thailand has hemoptysis, night sweats, right upper lobe infiltrate, and
positive sputum acid-fast bacillus stain, raising strong suspicion for active pulmonary TB.
Tuberculin skin testing (TST) is generally positive in patients with active TB because
differentiated lymphocytes recognize injected tuberculin antigens and trigger a strong type IV
(cell-mediated) hypersensitivity response, leading to a large wheal of induration within 48-72
hours.

However, approximately 25% of patients with active TB have false negative TST (T cell
anergy). In these individuals, an impaired lymphocyte response results in minimal or no
induration after exposure to tuberculin antigens. Because a weak cell-mediated response
increases the risk of severe disseminated TB, patients with active disease who have TST
anergy are at much greater risk for TB-related morbidity and mortality.

A false-negative TST can also be seen with recent infection (it takes approximately 8 weeks for
the cell mediated response to fully form), immunocompromise (eg, HIV), improper injection
technique, and natural waning of immunity to latent infection. Because active TB requires a
microbial diagnosis (eg, identifying the organism on sputum sample), neither TST nor
interferon-gamma release assay can be used to diagnose or exclude the disease.
