Educational objective:

Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative, intracellular, gram-positive rod that produces a very
narrow zone of beta hemolysis on blood agar, shows tumbling motility at room temperature,
and can grow at refrigerated temperatures. Intracellular pathogens such as Listeria are largely
eliminated by the cell-mediated immune response (eg, T-cells, macrophages, cytokines).
Patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity are at risk for invasive Listeria infections.
