Educational objective:

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is resistant to most beta-lactam
medications (eg, oxacillin, methicillin, cephalosporins) due to the acquisition of a mobile
genetic element that contains the mecA gene. This gene encodes for a specialized penicillin-
binding protein that has low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. Treatment of MRSA therefore
requires a nonâ€”beta-lactam medication such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, clindamycin,
doxycycline, or vancomycin.
