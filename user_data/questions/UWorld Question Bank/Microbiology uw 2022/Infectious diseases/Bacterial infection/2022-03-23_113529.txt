A 3-year-old girl is brought to the emergency department due to 2 days of worsening dysuria
and urinary frequency. She is fully toilet-trained, and the parents say that she cries every time
she urinates. The patient has had no fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. A small amount of urine is
obtained via clean-catch collection. Because of the limited volume, only urinalysis is
performed; it shows positive leukocyte esterase and negative nitrites. The patient is
prescribed an oral antibiotic, with the first dose given prior to discharge. The following
morning, she is taken immediately to the clinic for a follow-up appointment. Another sample is
obtained, and urinalysis is now positive for both leukocyte esterase and nitrites. Which of the
following factors is most likely responsible for the new urinalysis findings?

©) A. Dilute urine in the morning sample

©) B. Greater white blood cell activity in the morning sample
©) C. Increased time that bacteria have been in the bladder
() D. Presence of antibiotic-resistant organisms

() E. Sample contamination with normal skin flora
