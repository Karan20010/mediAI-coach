Common antibiotic resistance mechanisms

Penicillins

Beta-lactamase, ESBL
Mutated PBP
Mutated porin protein

Vancomycin

Mutated peptidoglycan cell wall

¢ Impaired influx/increased efflux

Quinolones

Mutated DNA gyrase

¢ Impaired influx/increased efflux

Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes
Mutated ribosomal subunit protein
Mutated porin protein

Tetracyclines

¢ Impaired influx/increased efflux

e Inactivated enzyme

Rifamycins

Mutated RNA polymerase

ESBL = extended-spectrum beta-lactamase; PBP = penicillin-binding protein.
