Severe pharyngitis with exudates and cervical lymphadenopathy in a group of people with
unknown vaccination status should raise suspicion for respiratory diphtheria infection.
Diphtheria toxin can cause severe myocarditis and heart failure, which occurred in one of the
patients in the vignette. Diphtheria toxin acts in a similar manner to exotoxin A, which is
produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

P aeruginosa produces several extracellular products, including exotoxin A, collagenase,
elastase, fibrinolysin, phospholipase C, and DNAse. These substances assist in its invasion
and dissemination in human tissues. Although they are structurally different, both diphtheria
toxin and exotoxin A ribosylate and inactivate elongation factor-2 (EF-2), halting human cell
protein synthesis and causing cell death. Exotoxin Ais a major virulence factor and is
responsible for the high mortality associated with P aeruginosa septicemia.
