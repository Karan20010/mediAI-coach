Patients with indwelling bladder catheters are at increased risk for urinary tract infections
(UTIs) caused by both typical (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
Saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis) and opportunistic (eg, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, other
Staphylococci, fungal) organisms. This patient's culture results are consistent with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the only non-lactose-fermenting, Gram-negative rod listed. It is
also the only one that is oxidase positive.

(Choice A) Enterobacter cloacae is a lactose-fermenting, Gram-negative rod characterized by
extensive antibiotic resistance. It causes nosocomial infections, including UTIs, pneumonia,
and surgical site infections.

(Choice B) Enterococcus faecalis is a Gram-positive coccus in the Enterococcaceae family
that is a common cause of opportunistic UTIs. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus is a
particularly fearsome isolate that is increasing in prevalence.

(Choice C) Escherichia coli is a lactose-fermenting, Gram-negative rod and the leading cause
of both complicated (including catheter-associated) and uncomplicated UTIs.

(Choice D) Klebsiella pneumoniae is a lactose-fermenting, Gram-negative rod. Itis a Activate Window
