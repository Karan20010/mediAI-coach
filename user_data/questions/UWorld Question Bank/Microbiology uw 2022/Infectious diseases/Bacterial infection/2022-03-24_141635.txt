This neonate with respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, grunting, subcostal retractions) and
gram-positive rods on blood culture most likely has neonatal sepsis due to infection with
Listeria monocytogenes. L monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular anaerobe that
typically causes outbreaks via ingestion of contaminated foods (eg, unpasteurized milk, deli
meats). The bacteria can replicate at cold temperatures (eg, refrigeration) and can invade the
intestinal mucosa once ingested, causing gastroenteritis (eg, fever, vomiting, diarrhea). Most
cases in healthy patients are self-limited; however, pregnant women, neonates, elderly
patients, and immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for invasive disease (eg,
bacteremia, meningitis).

Neonatal listeriosis may be acquired during or after delivery or by transplacental
transmission of the bacteria to the fetus. Infection in late pregnancy can cause fetal distress,
premature delivery, or signs of neonatal sepsis (eg, respiratory distress, temperature
instability) within the first few hours of life, as seen in this patient. Maternal infection in early
pregnancy can be more damaging to the fetus, causing granulomatosis infantiseptica (ie, skin
lesions, disseminated abscesses/granulomas) and/or fetal demise.
