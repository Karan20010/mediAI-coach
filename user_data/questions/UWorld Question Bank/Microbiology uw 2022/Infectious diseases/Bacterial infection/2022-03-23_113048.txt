A 35-year-old man comes to the office due to 3 months of progressive swelling under his left
jaw. The swelling spontaneously opened and drained pus a month ago but has not improved
or resolved. The patient has no medical conditions other than dental caries; he had a tooth
extracted prior to symptom onset. Physical examination shows an indurated, nontender mass
in the left submandibular area with a small opening on the overlying skin. Gentle pressure on
the mass yields thick pus containing sand/grain-like particles. The microbial pathogen with
which of the following characteristics is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?

A. Bipolar-staining, gram-negative bacilli (1%)
B. Coagulase-producing, gram-positive cocci (14%)
C. Conidia-forming, dimorphic fungus (1%)

YD. Filamentous, branching, gram-positive bacilli (77%)

X© E. Oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacilli (3%)
