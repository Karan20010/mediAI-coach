(Choice A) Conjugation is the direct transfer of plasmids from one bacterium to another
through a pilus. Genes for antibiotic resistance are often transmitted in this manner.

(Choice B) Chromosomal mutations can theoretically lead to endotoxin production, but
mutations more commonly lead to bacterial antibiotic resistance.

(Choice C) The gram-positive, spore-forming rods Bacillus and Clostridium generate toxins
under environmental influences. The B anthracis spore, the causative agent in anthrax,
survives in soil for extended periods in a state of dormancy. Only upon warming to 37° C in
the presence of appropriate concentrations of CO, and protein do the spores germinate and
begin to synthesize toxin. The case is similar for C tetani spores, which germinate and
produce toxin only in anaerobic environments, such as necrotic wounds.

(Choice E) Transformation involves the direct uptake of genetic material from the environment
with subsequent incorporation into the bacterial genome. Streptococcus pneumoniae acquires
the ability to produce capsules via transformation. The capsule is the major virulence factor for
S pneumoniae; strains without the capsule are not pathogenic.
