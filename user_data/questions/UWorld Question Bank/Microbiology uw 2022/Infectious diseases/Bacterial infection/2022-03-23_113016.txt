Aminoglycosides interfere with the aminoacyl binding site on the 30S ribosomal subunit.
Binding of aminoglycoside causes the cell to misread mRNA and, as a result, it is unable to
perform protein synthesis. An important mechanism of resistance to aminoglycosides is the
methylation of the aminoglycoside-binding portion of the ribosome, which inhibits the ability of
aminoglycosides to interfere with protein translation. Other common resistance mechanisms
are the production of enzymes that inactivate the drug by altering its chemical structure or the
production of an efflux pump that decreases the drug's intracellular concentration.
