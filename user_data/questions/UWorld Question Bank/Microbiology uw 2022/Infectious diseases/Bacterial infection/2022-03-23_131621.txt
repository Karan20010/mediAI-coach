A microbiologist is studying the structure and function of bacterial cell walls. In an experiment,
group A streptococci are treated with chemicals to solubilize the cell wall. Various cell wall—
associated proteins are subsequently extracted. Electron microscopic evaluation of a specific
protein shows structural homology with mammalian tropomyosin and myosin. This protein
acts as a virulence factor for certain species of the organism. Which of the following is the
most likely function of this bacterial cell wall—associated protein?

©) A. Excrete antibiotics

©) B. Protect from osmotic lysis

©) C. Provide mechanical cell support
©) D. Resist phagocytosis

©) E. Transport nutrients into the cell
