This patient's acute febrile illness with tender, erythematous inguinal lymphadenopathy likely
indicates bubonic plague, a zoonotic infection endemic to North/South America, Africa, Asia,
and Russia. The causative pathogen is Yersinia pestis, a small gram-negative
bacillus/coccobacillus that exhibits bipolar staining (resembling a safety pin) on Giemsa or
Wright stain. Although many small mammals harbor the bacteria, rodents (eg, rats) are the
primary environmental reservoir. Transmission most often occurs when a flea that fed on an
infected rodent regurgitates the bacteria while biting a human. Therefore, the most likely
source of this patient's infection is close contact with rodent-infested areas (eg, changing
rodent traps).

After cutaneous inoculation, Y pestis travels via lymphatic channels to regional lymph nodes
and triggers a significant inflammatory reaction. Manifestations typically begin with acute
fever, chills, weakness, and headache; buboes (painful, swollen, erythematous lymph nodes)
develop shortly thereafter. Prompt treatment with an antibiotic (eg, aminoglycoside) is
generally curative.
