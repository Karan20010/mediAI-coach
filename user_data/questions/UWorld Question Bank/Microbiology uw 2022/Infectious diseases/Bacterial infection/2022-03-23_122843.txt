Educational objective:

Ehrlichia chaffeensis is harbored in white-tailed deer and transmitted to humans by tick bite. It
replicates in vacuoles within monocytes and forms mulberry-shaped, intraleukocytic inclusions
(morulae). Manifestations usually include nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, chills, myalgia),
maculopapular rash, and significant laboratory abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia.
