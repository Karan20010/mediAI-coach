Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S bovis) is the main human pathogen among
nonenterococcal group D streptococci. It causes a subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE)
with symptoms similar to those of S viridans SBE. S gallolyticus is part of the normal flora of
the colon, and bacteremia or endocarditis caused by S gallolyticus is associated with colonic
cancer in ~25% of cases. The relationship between S gallolyticus and colon cancer is
unclear, but every patient with S gallolyticus bacteremia with or without endocarditis should be
examined for a gastrointestinal tract malignancy.

S gallolyticus endocarditis is also unique in that most cases occur in patients without
preexisting valvular abnormality.
