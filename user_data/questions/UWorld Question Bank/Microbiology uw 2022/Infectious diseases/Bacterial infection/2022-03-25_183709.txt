Damage to the bone marrow and Gl lining following chemotherapy dramatically increases risk
of life-threatening systemic infection due to the following:

Â¢ Neutropenia: Neutrophils are normally the most prevalent leukocyte and are crucial for
initiating the local and systemic response to invading bacteria and fungi. Because
cytotoxic chemotherapy damages granulocyte precursors, patients often develop
neutropenia 10-14 days after treatment. Risk of infection increases with the duration and
severity of neutropenia.

Mucositis: The gastrointestinal epithelium has abundant blood flow and a high
turnover rate, which makes it particularly susceptible to damage from chemotherapy.
Patients frequently develop oral and gastrointestinal ulcers (mucositis), which create a
portal of entry for commensal bacteria to translocate from the lumen to surrounding tissue.
Because the neutrophil response is usually concurrently impaired, the bacteria are
frequently able to establish a nidus of infection and spread through the vasculature.

Therefore, to reduce the risk of serious infection, patients who receive systemic chemotherapy
are often empirically treated with prophylactic antibiotics (eg, ciprofloxacin) to prevent
commensal organisms from invading and with granulocyte-stimulating agents (eg, filgrastim) to
increase neutrophil count.
