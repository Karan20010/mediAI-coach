The mechanism of action of edema factor is very similar to that of the adenylate cyclase
toxin produced by Bordetella pertussis. Adenylate cyclase toxin is also a calmodulin-
dependent adenylate cyclase that increases cAMP concentration, leading to edema and
phagocyte dysfunction. This results in localized immunosuppression that allows B pertussis to
colonize the respiratory tract. The other major B pertussis exotoxin is pertussis toxin, which
increases cAMP concentration via ADP-ribosylation of a membrane G-protein.
