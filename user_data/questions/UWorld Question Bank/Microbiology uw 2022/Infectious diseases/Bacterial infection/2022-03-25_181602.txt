- 4 (Choice A) Structural alteration of enzymes involved in DNA winding-unwinding would
promote resistance to fluoroquinolones, drugs that bind and inhibit DNA gyrase in bacterial

(Choice C) Antibiotics that act on the ribosome can be divided into those that act on the 50S
10 subunit (eg, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, linezolid, macrolides) and those that act on the

2 smaller 30S subunit (tetracycline, doxycycline, aminoglycosides).

(Choice D) Decreased bacterial catalase-peroxidase activity is a mycobacterial response to
15 isoniazid. Before it can inhibit mycolic acid synthesis, isoniazid must be converted to its active

form by the mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase enzyme.

(Choice E) Upregulation of beta-lactamase synthesis would cause bacterial resistance to

a beta-lactam drugs such as penicillins, aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, and monobactams.
Infections caused by organisms expressing beta-lactamase require the addition of a beta-
lactamase inhibitor (eg, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam) or the use of a carbapenem.

Educational objective:
The rifamycins block the action of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby
inhibiting transcription. Resistance is acquired by modification of the rifampin binding site on
