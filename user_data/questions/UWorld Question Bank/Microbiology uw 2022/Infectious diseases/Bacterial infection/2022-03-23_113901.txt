(Choice A) Ethambutol appears to inhibit synthesis of the mycobacterial cell wall. Resistance
to this drug develops when the mycobacteria increase production of arabinosyl transferase (an
enzyme in the pathway to arabinogalactan, one of the key constituents of the mycobacterial
cell wall).

(Choice C) Because pyrazinamide must be converted to an active form by the mycobacterial
enzyme pyrazinamidase, drug resistance can occur in those organisms that have modified
their pyrazinamidase to be structurally ineffective.

(Choice D) Resistance to rifampin in M tuberculosis is primarily due to a mutation in the gene
that codes for a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase necessary for transcription and RNA
prolongation.

(Choice E) Streptomycin (used in some cases of tuberculosis) is an aminoglycoside that
inhibits mycobacterial protein synthesis by disabling the bacterial ribosomal 30S subunit
(which disrupts translation). Resistance to this drug is primarily achieved by a modification of
the 30S ribosomal protein.
