This patient most likely has active tuberculosis, which should never be treated with drug
monotherapy due to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in M. tuberculosis. |soniazid
resistance specifically occurs by two selective gene mutations. The first is a decrease in
bacterial expression of the catalase-peroxidase enzyme that is required for isoniazid activation
once the drug enters the bacterial cell. The second mechanism of resistance occurs through
modification of the protein target binding site for isoniazid. Treatment of active tuberculosis is
accomplished by combining multiple antibiotics to avoid selecting for resistant strains.
Commonly used drug regimens include isoniazid and rifampin in addition to streptomycin,
ethambutol, and/or pyrazinamide.

Isoniazid monotherapy may be used for patients who have a positive PPD and a negative
chest x-ray (i.e., no evidence of clinical disease).
