Educational objective:

Acute-onset bloody diarrhea is most commonly due to Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Shigella, or
Campylobacter infection. Shigella infection also classically causes high fever and left-sided
abdominal tenderness (due to rectosigmoid involvement) and often occurs in outbreaks (eg,

day care center).
