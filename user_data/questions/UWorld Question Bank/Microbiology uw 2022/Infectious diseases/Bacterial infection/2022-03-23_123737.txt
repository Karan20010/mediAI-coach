42 bacteria; however, these antibodies provide limited a no protective immunity against future
8 infections due to an extremely high rate of antigenic variation in bacterial surface molecules
a (eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide).
: (Choice A) Memory T cells form in response to gonococcal infection but are not effective at
18 preventing reinfection due to high antigenic variation, which prevents recognition of antigens
= from the organism.
. = (Choice B) The humoral antibody response can be impaired by severe malnutrition; however,
23 the high rate of antigenic variability in gonococcal infection would already preclude
* development of an effective antibody response.

(Choice D) Antigenic mimicry occurs when an organism displays similar antigens to the host,

28 preventing the host's immune system from recognizing the organism as foreign.

30 (Choice E) Gonorrhea is largely susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins (eg,

= ceftriaxone) but may be resistant to penicillins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. Antibiotic

33 resistance should be suspected when initial symptoms do not improve with treatment.

= Because this patient's initial symptoms resolved after he was treated with ceftriaxone and then

36 recurred a few months later, reinfection is far more likely than drug resistance.
