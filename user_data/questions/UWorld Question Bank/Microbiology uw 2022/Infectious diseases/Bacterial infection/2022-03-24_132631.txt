Educational objective:

Vibrio cholerae must survive the acidic environment of the stomach to reach the small intestine
and cause disease. Because the organism is easily destroyed by acid, a high burden of
organisms must be ingested to cause infection. However, conditions that decrease gastric
acidity (eg, antacid use) lower the minimum infectious dose of V cholerae by multiple orders of
magnitude.
