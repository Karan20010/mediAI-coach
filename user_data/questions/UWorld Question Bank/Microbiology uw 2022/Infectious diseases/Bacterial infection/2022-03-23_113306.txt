(Choices A and B) Clostridium tetani and Corynebacterium species (eg, C diphtheriae) are

also gram-positive rods. However, tetanus usually presents with hypertonicity and

spasms, while diphtheria typically causes severe pharyngitis; neonatal infection with either is
uncommon in resource-rich countries due to transplacental transfer of neutralizing antibodies
from immunized mothers. In addition, neither pathogen causes early-onset neonatal sepsis.

(Choices C and E) Escherichia coli and Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococcus)
are the most common causes of neonatal sepsis. However, E coli is a gram-negative rod, and
S agalactiae appears as gram-positive cocci in chains.

(Choice F) Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive diplococcus and a common cause
of bacteremia and meningitis in infants age 21 month.
