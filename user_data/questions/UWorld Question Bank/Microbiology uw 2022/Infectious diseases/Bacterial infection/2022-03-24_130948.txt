Mechanism of action of selected bacterial exotoxins

Organism Toxin Mechanism & effects
Edema factor: Increases cyclic AMP concentration by
acting as an adenylate cyclase, causing edema &
Bacillus Anthrax phagocyte dysfunction
anthracis | exotoxin Lethal factor: Zinc-dependent protease that inhibits
mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, causing
apoptosis & multisystem physiologic disruption
Disinhibits adenylate cyclase through G; ADP-
Pertussis toxin |ribosylation, increasing cAMP levels; causes edema &
Bordetella .
phagocyte dysfunction
pertussis
Adenylate Functions as an adenylate cyclase, increasing cAMP
cyclase toxin |levels; causes edema & phagocyte dysfunction
Clostridium Botulinum Blocks presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the
botulinum toxin neuromuscular junction, resulting in flaccid paralysis
