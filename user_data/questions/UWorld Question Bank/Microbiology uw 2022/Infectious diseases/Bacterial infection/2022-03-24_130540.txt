Researchers studying fungal pathogens isolated an ergosterol biosynthetic gene by

polymerase chain reaction. Using homologous recombination, they then developed a new

strain of Candida with a mutated allele for that gene. The mutant strain was cultured in the

presence of several different antifungal agents. Compared to isolates from the wild-type

strain, isolates from the mutant Candida strain exhibited enhanced growth in the presence of

drug X. Further investigation revealed that the mechanism of resistance to drug X was a

decrease in ergosterol incorporation into the cell membrane. Based on this data, drug X is

likely to be most closely related to which of the following antifungal agents?

v

A. Caspofungin (22%)
B. Cyclosporine (2%)
C. Flucytosine (8%)
D. Griseofulvin (9%)
E. Nystatin (57%)
