Early penicillin treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis is important for the
prevention of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), a major cause of cardiovascular death in many
developing nations. ARF primarily affects the heart and central nervous system because host
antibodies produced in response to streptococcal antigens cross-react with host antigens in
these organs. Chronic cardiac inflammation can progress to rheumatic heart disease,
specifically valvular disease. The mitral valve is the most commonly affected and gradually
thickens, fibroses, and calcifies, eventually requiring valvotomy or more invasive surgical
intervention.

Empiric therapy for a condition must be considered in the context of the host characteristics,
pre-test probability of the disease, benefits/risks of waiting for a definitive diagnosis, and cost
of therapy versus its potential complications. If all cases of acute streptococcal pharyngitis
were treated empirically, the incidence of rheumatic heart disease and associated cardiac
procedures would likely decrease.
