(Choice A) Latent viral infections are typically from the family Herpesviridae (eg, herpes
simplex virus 1, varicella zoster virus) and can be a source of neutropenic fever. However,
skin findings (eg, ulceration of the oral mucosa, disseminated vesicles in multiple dermatomes)
are usually present.

(Choice B) Although anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of the gastrointestinal
tract, anaerobes are not typically identified as pathogens in patients with neutropenic fever
unless the infection is polymicrobial (which is uncommon) or associated with abdominal
surgery.

(Choice C) Disseminated tuberculosis can be a cause of fever in an immunocompromised
patient, but weight loss, fatigue, respiratory symptoms, and abnormal chest x-ray are typically
present. In addition, the presentation is usually subacute over days to weeks (vs 4 hours).

(Choice E) Invasive fungal infections can occur in neutropenic patients. However, they are
typically slower growing (vs 4 hours) and are rarely the cause of an initial presentation of
neutropenic fever. Instead, they are more commonly found in patients with persistent (eg, 7
days) or recurrent neutropenic fever who are at high risk (eg, increased number of
chemotherapy cycles).
