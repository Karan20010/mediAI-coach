(Choice A) Secretory IgA found in breast milk helps prevent respiratory and gastrointestinal
infections in the newborn by providing mucosal immune support. However, adequate
protection against neonatal tetanus requires the presence of toxin-neutralizing, circulating IgG
antibodies that are obtained transplacentally.

(Choices B and C) Treatment of tetanus, including neonatal tetanus, involves the use of
antibiotics to kill C tetani and administration of tetanus immune globulin to neutralize unbound
toxin. However, these agents are not used for tetanus prevention.

(Choice D) Tetanus vaccination is not given at birth because the neonatal immune system is
immature and unable to mount a proper memory immune response against the tetanus toxoid.
The first dose of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus series is commonly administered at 2 months
of age. In areas of endemic tetanus disease, this vaccine can be given as early as 4-6 weeks
of age, but not earlier.
