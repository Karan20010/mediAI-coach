Features of cystic fibrosis

Pathogenesis

Autosomal recessive mutation (AF508) impairs CFTR function
Decreased water content causes thick, viscous mucus:

© Chronic airway obstruction

© Gastrointestinal malabsorption

Clinical
manifestations

Chronic, productive cough

Recurrent sinopulmonary infections (eg, Staphylococcus aureus,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, & Burkholderia cepacia complex)
Pancreatic insufficiency

Male infertility (bilateral absence of vas deferens)

Diagnosis

Elevated sweat chloride levels
Nasal potential difference measurements
Genetic testing for CFTR mutations

CFTR = cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.
