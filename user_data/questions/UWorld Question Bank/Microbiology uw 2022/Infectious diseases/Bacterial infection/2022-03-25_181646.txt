(Choice A) Basophils are not involved in TSS. Basophilia can be seen with some
myeloproliferative disorders and, rarely, certain parasitic infections.

release histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators; they are

specific for the antigen with which they were presented; they are not responsible for TSS.

Superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin) interact with major histocompatibility complex
molecules on antigen-presenting cells and the variable region of the T lymphocyte receptor to
cause nonspecific, widespread activation of T cells. This results in the release of interleukin
(IL)-2 from the T cells and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor from macrophages. This immune
cascade is responsible for the manifestations of toxic shock syndrome.
