A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to an acute febrile illness that developed after a
deer-hunting trip in Arkansas. The patient recalls getting tick bites in the woods but initially
had no symptoms. He began experiencing fever, chills, malaise, headache, and myalgia a
week after his return. Physical examination shows a diffuse, maculopapular rash; clear
oropharynx; normal lung and heart sounds; and mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness.
Laboratory testing reveals leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated aminotransferase
levels. Microscopic evaluation of the blood demonstrates mulberry-shaped, intracytoplasmic
inclusions in monocytes. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen responsible for this
patient's condition?
