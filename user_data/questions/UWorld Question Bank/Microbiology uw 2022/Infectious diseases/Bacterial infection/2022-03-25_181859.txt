Educational objective:

Isoniazid is an antimycobacterial agent that specifically inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids,
which are essential components of the unique mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall. Without
mycolic acids, the mycobacteria lose their acid-fastness and become unable to synthesize new

cell walls or multiply.
