should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which contains polysaccharide antigens from the
most common strains.

(Choice A) Alveolar hyaline membranes are fibrinous deposits that line the alveoli and inhibit
gas transfer. They usually result in significant dyspnea and/or respiratory collapse, and are
typically seen with newborn and acute respiratory distress syndromes.

(Choice C) Endotoxins (eg, lipopolysaccharide) are found in the outer membrane of gram-
negative pathogens (eg, Neisseria) and produce a strong inflammatory response when
released into the circulation. Gram-positive organisms do not have endotoxins but some
release exotoxins.

(Choice D) Intracellular organisms such as Neisseria, Listeria, and Mycobacterium
tuberculosis are protected from immunoglobulin and complement binding. S pneumoniae is an
extracellular pathogen.

(Choice E) Mycobacteria have lipid-rich mycolic acid in their cell walls, which causes them to
be acid-fast. Mycolic acids inhibit bacterial destruction by the phagolysosome and contribute
to granuloma formation.
