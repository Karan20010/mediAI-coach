eschar at the site of transmission. Tender regional lymphadenopathy occurs simultaneously
or within a few days and may become suppurative. Most patients have fever. Sometimes,
the cutaneous lesion is not present; other forms of tularemia can also occur, including
pneumonia.

(Choice A) Tularemia is not spread by human-to-human transmission. It can spread via
contact with infected animals, an invertebrate bite, or an aerosolized bioweapon.

(Choice B) Frequent gardening is a risk factor for sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by
Sporothrix schenckii. Although this condition causes a papuloulcerative lesion with
surrounding erythema, it typically progresses over months, not days. In addition, the lesion is
not usually painful and does not produce pus or odor.

(Choice C) The most virulent form of tularemia is found in the United States. Travel outside
of the United States is not strongly associated with infection.

(Choice D) Several sexually transmitted infections, including infection with Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, a gram-negative diplococcus, can cause suppurative inguinal lesions. However,
an ulcerative lesion along the thigh would be atypical.
