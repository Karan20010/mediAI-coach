with a nonvaccinated serotype can still occur.

(Choice A) Antigenic variation in the bacterial cell wall can lead to short-lived immunity
against certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria gonorrhoeae). In contrast, S pneumoniae antigenic
variation occurs primarily on the polysaccharide capsule, not the cell wall.

(Choice B) Some S pneumoniae strains have no polysaccharide capsule; these strains are
minimally virulent and rarely cause invasive disease.

(Choice D) T-cell immunodeficiency would likely increase the risk for poor response to
vaccinations. However, primary T-cell immunodeficiency is quite rare and typically presents
with recurrent upper respiratory infections. This patient is far more likely to be infected with a
strain not in the vaccine.

(Choice E) The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) contains capsular
polysaccharide antigens with no protein conjugate; therefore, it elicits a T-cell-independent
response and is not immunogenic enough to be used in individuals age <2. PPSV23 is
reserved primarily for high-risk adults.

Educational objective:

Streptococcus pneumoniae is virulent it primarily due toa polysaccharide capsule. A conjugant
