This patient most likely has scarlet fever, which is caused by strains of Group A
streptococcus that produce pyrogenic exotoxins. Scarlet fever is most often associated with
streptococcal pharyngitis, which begins acutely after an incubation period of 1-5 days. Initial
symptoms include fever, malaise, abdominal pain, and sore throat. The pharynx is typically
erythematous, swollen, and possibly covered with gray-white exudates. In addition, the tongue
can have inflamed red papillae with an appearance similar to that of a red strawberry.

After 1-2 days, a rash appears on the neck, armpits, and groin that subsequently generalizes
to the rest of the body. The rash begins as scarlet spots or blotches, giving a boiled lobster
appearance. As the rash progresses and becomes more widespread, it begins to resemble a
sunburn with goose pimples (“sandpaper-like” rash). The cheeks commonly appear flushed,
giving the area around the mouth a pale appearance in comparison (circumoral pallor).
Toward the end of the first week, desquamation begins and is most pronounced in the armpits,
groin, and tips of the fingers and toes.

As with any streptococcal upper respiratory infection, scarlet fever can predispose to acute
rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. Treatment with penicillin V can prevent the
development of rheumatic fever, although its role in preventing glomerulonephritis is uncertain.
