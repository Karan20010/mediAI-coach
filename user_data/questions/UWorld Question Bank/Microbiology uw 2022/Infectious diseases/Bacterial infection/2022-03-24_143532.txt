A 43-year-old immigrant from Southern Asia suffers from a cough that has lasted for several
months duration. He comes to the clinic today because of recent onset hemoptysis. On
further evaluation, he reports a 15-Ib weight loss over the past four months. Sputum cultures
grow acid-fast bacilli that are susceptible to most antimycobacterial drugs in vitro. Isoniazid
monotherapy in this patient would most likely result in:

©) A. Bacteriocidal effect on only extracellular bacilli

©) B. Decreased transport protein expression on the cell surface
©) C. B-lactamase induction within bacterial cells

©) D. Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body

©) E. Selective survival of bacterial cells secondary to gene mutation
