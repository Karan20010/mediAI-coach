Educational objective:

Neonatal tetanus can be prevented by hygienic delivery and umbilical cord care and universal
immunization of women who are pregnant or may become pregnant. Immunized mothers
provide passive immunity via transplacental IgG, protecting infants until they receive active
immunization (vaccination) around age 2 months.
