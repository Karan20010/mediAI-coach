Nonsuppurative complications of GAS infections include acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and
glomerulonephritis, thought to be due to the formation of different anti-streptococcal antibodies
that cross-react with heart tissue or result in immune complex deposition in the kidney.
Glomerulonephritis is associated with prior streptococcal pharyngeal or skin infection (eg,
cellulitis, impetigo, erysipelas); ARF is associated with prior streptococcal pharyngitis but not
skin infection. Previous streptococcal infection is evidenced by elevated streptococcal
antibodies (anti-streptolysin, anti-DNaseB, and anti-hyaluronidase).

S pyogenes are catalase-negative, B-hemolytic, gram-positive cocci in chains. S pyogenes is
unique among B-hemolytic streptococci as it is susceptible to bacitracin. Because the
bacitracin test is not very specific for S pyogenes, it has been replaced in many laboratories by
the pyrrolidonyl arylamidase (PYR) test; S pyogenes is PYR-positive.
