and lethargy. The patient was born at full term to a 21-year-old woman who came to the
emergency department in active labor with ruptured membranes; she had not received
adequate prenatal care. On physical examination, the boy is hypothermic, tachycardic, and
tachypneic, and he has mottled skin. Blood samples are obtained, and empiric antibiotics are
