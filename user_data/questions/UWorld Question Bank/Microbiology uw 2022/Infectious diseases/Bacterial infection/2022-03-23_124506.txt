(Choices A and D) Like Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio cholerae are acid
sensitive and thrive in more alkaline conditions, requiring a relatively high ID;, (10-102).

(Choice B) Some strains of Escherichia coli that cause gastroenteritis (eg, Shiga toxinâ€”
producing E coli) have a low ID;, due to their ability to survive an acidic environment, similar to

Shigella. However, enterotoxigenic E coli is less adaptive to extreme acidity and therefore has
a higher ID.

(Choice E) Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague (eg, fever, buboes), has an extremely
low ID;, (<10 organisms) when transmitted via the subcutaneous route (eg, fleas). In contrast,
Yersinia enterocolitica (fecal-oral transmission, diarrheal illness) has a higher ID;.; although

this bacterium produces urease, making it somewhat acid resistant, its growth is improved in
more alkaline conditions.
