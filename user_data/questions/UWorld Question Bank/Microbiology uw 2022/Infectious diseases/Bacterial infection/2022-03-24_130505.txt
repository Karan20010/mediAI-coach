This pregnant woman has febrile gastroenteritis (eg, fever, vomiting, diarrhea) and gram-
positive rods in her bloodstream, raising strong suspicion for Listeria monocytogenes
infection. L monocytogenes is a motile, facultatively intracellular organism with several
unique adaptations that allow it to evade the host immune response, including the following:

e Listeriolysin O: This major virulence factor generates pores in phagosome membranes,
which allows phagocytosed L monocytogenes to escape into the cytoplasm of
monocytes and avoid lysosomal destruction.

Â¢ Actin-based transcellular spread: The organism hijacks the actin-based cellular motility
mechanism of host cells, which allows it to spread to adjacent cells without reentering the
extracellular space. This significantly reduces exposure of L monocytogenes to antibodies
and phagocytic cells.
Because of these adaptations, antibody- and phagocyte-mediated destruction of the pathogen
is impaired; therefore, infections are controlled primarily by the cytotoxic T-cell response.
Most L monocytogenes infections occur in pregnant women in the third trimester. Although

antibiotics are curative, L monocytogenes quickly invades the placenta and may cause fetal
death, premature birth, and neonatal infection.
