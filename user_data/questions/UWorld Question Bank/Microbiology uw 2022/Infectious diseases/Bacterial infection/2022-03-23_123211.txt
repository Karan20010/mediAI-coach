Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is a major cause of acute renal failure in children. It is
characterized by the triad of renal insufficiency, thrombocytopenia, and microangiopathic
hemolytic anemia. Most cases occur due to underlying enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli
(EHEC) infection, particularly with the 0157:H7 serotype.

EHEC is a gram-negative, enteric rod that acquires the ability to produce Shiga toxin from a
lysogenic bacteriophage. Shiga toxin enters the cytosol of host cells and cleaves a protein
motif off the 60S ribosomal subunit, which irreversibly halts host protein synthesis and causes
cell death. Toxin-mediated injury to the colonic mucosa and the colonic capillaries causes
abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. The absorption of Shiga toxin into the systemic
circulation causes glomerular (renal insufficiency) and vascular (thrombocytopenia,
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia) injury in a minority of patients, leading to HUS.

The primary reservoir for EHEC is the gastrointestinal tract of healthy cattle. Humans primarily
acquire the organism after consuming contaminated, undercooked beef. Because low
infectious doses (10-100 organisms) are required for disease, meatpacking facilities that
process high volumes of ground beef are an important source of outbreaks. Other less
common routes of transmission include person-to-person contact and fruits and vegetables
contaminated with manure.
