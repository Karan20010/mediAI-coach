(Choice A) In contrast to the gastrointestinal epithelium, which has a very high turnover rate,
the urothelial barrier regenerates every 3-6 months. Therefore, it is minimally affected by short
chemotherapy cycles.

(Choices B and D) Unlike neutrophils, which live 5-10 days, plasma cells have low turnover
rates; therefore, levels of circulating immunoglobulin are typically unaffected by most
chemotherapy for solid tumors (eg, breast cancer). Similarly, tissue-resident macrophages
have a long life-span and are not significantly impaired by chemotherapy cycles.

Educational objective:

Cytotoxic chemotherapy nonselectively kills rapidly dividing cells, including tumor, hair follicle,
bone marrow, and gastrointestinal epithelial cells. Severe infections are common due to
neutropenia from myelosuppression and commensal bacterial invasion via gastrointestinal
epithelial damage from mucositis.
