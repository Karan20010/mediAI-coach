(Choice A) Superantigens cause a tremendous release of cytokines through nonspecific T
cell receptor activation, leading to acute fever, hypotension, and erythroderma. This is the
mechanism of action of the toxic shock syndrome exotoxins produced by both Staphylococcus

aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes.

(Choice C) An embolic stroke from infective endocarditis can present with fever, a new-onset
murmur, and focal neurologic deficits. In addition, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, and Roth
spots are specific findings of infectious endocarditis. The most common pathogens are S
aureus, viridans group streptococci, and enterococci.

(Choice D) The deposition of streptococcal antigen immune complexes in glomeruli causes
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, a type Ill hypersensitivity reaction. Patients have
microscopic or gross hematuria, edema, hypertension, and proteinuria.

(Choice E) Scarlet fever is caused by the body's response to an erythrogenic (pyrogenic)
toxin released by group A Streptococcus. It presents with a diffuse, erythematous,
"sandpaper"-textured rash most notable in the skin folds (eg, inguinal, axillary, antecubital
areas). Scarlet fever can occur with pharyngitis and can lead to acute rheumatic fever if

untreated.
