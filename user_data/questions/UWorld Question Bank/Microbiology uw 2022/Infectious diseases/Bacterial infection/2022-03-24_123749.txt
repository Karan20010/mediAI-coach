Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, gram-positive rod that produces a very
narrow zone of beta hemolysis on blood agar (similar to group B Streptococcus
[Streptococcus agalactiae]). Listeria is immotile at body temperature but demonstrates
tumbling motility at room temperature. The pathogen is also distinguished by an ability to
multiply at refrigerated temperatures (cold enrichment), which is one reason Listeria is an
important cause of foodborne illness (eg, refrigerated soft cheese, meats, unpasteurized milk).
