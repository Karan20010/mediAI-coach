Educational objective:

The rifamycins block the action of the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, thereby
inhibiting transcription. Resistance is acquired by modification of the rifampin binding site on
the bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Common side effects include hepatotoxicity,
blood dyscrasias, and harmless red-orange discoloration of body fluids.
