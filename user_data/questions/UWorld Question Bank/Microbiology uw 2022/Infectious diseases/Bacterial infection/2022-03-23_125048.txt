Educational objective:

The duration of catheterization (especially >48 hr) is the most important risk factor for catheter-
associated urinary tract infection. Prevention strategies include avoiding inappropriate
catheterization (eg, placing catheter solely due to incontinence) and promptly removing the
catheter when it is no longer needed.
