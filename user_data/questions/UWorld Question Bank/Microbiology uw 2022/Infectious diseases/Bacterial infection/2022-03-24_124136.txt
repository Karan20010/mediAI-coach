Bacillus anthracis is a large, nonmotile, nonhemolytic, gram-positive rod that forms colonies
in culture with multiple curled extensions at the edges that resemble a "Medusa head."
Because the organism proliferates in soil contaminated with manure, pasture-grazing
herbivores such as sheep, cattle, and horses are at greatest risk for infection. However,
transmission to humans occasionally occurs when B anthracis spores are inhaled, ingested,
or inoculated into the skin.
