Viridans streptococci, notably Streptococcus mutans and S sanguinis, are normally present
in the human mouth and are major contributors to tooth decay and the initiation of dental
caries. These organisms also cause bacterial endocarditis, deep wound infections,
abdominal abscesses, and septicemia. Viridans streptococci can adhere to tooth enamel and
to fibrin-platelet aggregates on damaged heart valves due to their ability to produce insoluble
extracellular polysaccharides (dextrans) using sucrose as a substrate. This colonization of
host surfaces contributes to their ability to cause infection.
