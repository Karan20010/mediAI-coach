This patient with fever, abdominal pain, and mucopurulent cervical discharge has pelvic
inflammatory disease (PID). PID is typically treated with empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics
(eg, ceftriaxone plus doxycycline) to cover the most common pathogens (ie, Chlamydia
trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae).

However, patients with long-term intrauterine devices (IUDs) are at increased risk for
developing an active Actinomyces infection, as evidenced by this patient's culture that
reveals acute-angle branching, gram-positive bacilli. Actinomyces is a facultative
anaerobic bacterium and part of normal gastrointestinal flora. Because of the proximity of the
anus to the vagina, lower genital tract colonization with Actinomyces is common in women.
The bacteria can ascend to the upper genital tract to colonize an indwelling IUD.

An Actinomyces infection is difficult to eradicate in the presence of a foreign body; therefore,
IUD removal is required. In addition to empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics, patients need

targeted antibiotic pharmacotherapy with penicillin, which works by binding penicillin-binding
proteins, blocking transpeptidase formation in the cell wall, and activating autolytic enzymes.
