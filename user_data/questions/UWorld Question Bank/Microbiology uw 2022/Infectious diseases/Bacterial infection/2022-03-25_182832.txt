4 including fever, increased capillary permeability, and hypotension.
5
6 (Choice A) Endotoxin in the cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria can cause rapid-onset
z fever and hypotension due to activation of toll-like receptors on cells of the innate immune
9 system. However, in this case, the presence of nasal packing and a diffuse, erythematous
s rash make TSS far more likely than gram-negative sepsis.
(Choice C) Anaphylactic shock occurs due to antigen-stimulated cross-linking of IgE that is:
- 44 bound to basophils or mast cells, which activates the cell and releases massive amounts of
= inflammatory mediators. Anaphylactic shock is typically characterized by hypotension,
17 bronchospasm, and shortness of breath; most cases are triggered by insect stings, food, or
. medications, and manifestations occur shortly after exposure.
7 20 (Choice D) Patients who develop TSS usually have a noninvasive infection in the vaginal
» 21
+ 2 canal or area of wound packing. TSS is mediated by the absorption of superantigens into the
blood, not the invasion of bacteria.
Educational objective:
Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound
packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic
