This patient, who travels regularly to Vietnam and now has a cough, night sweats, and weight
loss with a right upper lobe infiltrate on chest x-ray and acid-fast bacilli on sputum examination,
likely has pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Pulmonary TB is treated with a 4-drug regimen,
sometimes referred to as RIPE: rifampin, isoniazid (INH), pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. The
most notable side effect of ethambutol is optic neuropathy, which clinically manifests as
decreased visual acuity, central scotoma, or color blindness. It may be reversible with
discontinuation of the drug.
