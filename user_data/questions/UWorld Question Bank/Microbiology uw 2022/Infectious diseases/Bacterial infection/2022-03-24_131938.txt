(Choice B) Ceftriaxone is a third-generation cephalosporin used primarily for the treatment of
community-acquired pneumonia and bacterial meningitis. It has activity against some Gram-
positive (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes) and Gram-negative (eg, Haemophilus
influenzae, K pneumoniae, E coli) pathogens. Unlike ceftazidime, it has poor activity against P
aeruginosa.

(Choice C) Doxycycline is effective against Lyme disease and many tickborne rickettsial
diseases but does not have good anti-pseudomonal coverage.

(Choice D) Moxifloxacin is a fluoroquinolone used mainly for the treatment of bacterial
infections that cause exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sinusitis, and
community-acquired pneumonia. Unlike ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, moxifloxacin has poor

anti-pseudomonal activity.

(Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used to treat susceptible organisms that cause
urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and skin infections. It is the drug of choice for organisms such
as Pneumocystis jiroveci, Toxoplasma gondii, Nocardia, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. \t
does not have activity against P aeruginosa.
