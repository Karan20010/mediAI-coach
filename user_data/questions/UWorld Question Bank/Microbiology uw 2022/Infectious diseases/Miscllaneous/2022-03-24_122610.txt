This neonate has fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy, which
are nonspecific findings for congenital infection. This patient's rhinorrhea and desquamating
rash involving the hands and feet are further suggestive of congenital syphilis.

Congenital syphilis is transmitted transplacentally from an infected mother. Routine prenatal
screening with treatment (ie, penicillin) when indicated can decrease the risk for transmission;
however, cases still occur due to limited access to prenatal care or primary infection
acquired after screening.
