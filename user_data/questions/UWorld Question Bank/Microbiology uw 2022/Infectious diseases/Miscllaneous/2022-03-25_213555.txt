(Choice A) Doxycycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and is effective in clostridial skin
infections (eg, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum), but it is not effective for the
treatment of CDI.

(Choice C) Metronidazole interacts with DNA in anaerobic organisms, disrupting DNA
structure and causing strand breakage. Oral metronidazole is no longer a first-line treatment
for CDI. Intravenous metronidazole can be a useful adjunct in patients with fulminant CDI (eg,
megacolon, ileus, hypotension) because passage of oral antibiotics to the colon is often
delayed.

(Choice D) Neomycin is a bactericidal aminoglycoside that inhibits the 30S ribosomal

subunit. It can be used to treat hepatic encephalopathy or diarrhea due to Escherichia coli and
as surgical prophylaxis for gastrointestinal procedures. However, it is not effective against C
difficile.

(Choice E) Oral vancomycin has minimal systemic absorption and is bacteriostatic at the
concentrations typically used for CDI treatment. Although it is a first-line treatment option for
CDI, its mechanism of action is inhibition of cell wall synthesis, not inhibition of RNA
polymerase.
