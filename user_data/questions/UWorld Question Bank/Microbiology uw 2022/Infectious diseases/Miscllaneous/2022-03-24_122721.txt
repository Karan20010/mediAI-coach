A 24-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to fevers and chills over the
last 24 hours. Three weeks ago, she underwent a partial bowel resection for Crohn disease
without complications. Since the surgery, the patient has had difficulty eating and has a
peripherally inserted central venous catheter in place through which she is receiving parenteral
nutrition. Her temperature is 38.2 C (101 F), blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and pulse is
114/min. The surgical wound healed well, and her abdomen is soft and nontender. The
catheter site on the left arm is mildly tender but shows no erythema. Chest x-ray reveals a
properly positioned central venous line and is otherwise unremarkable. Admission blood
cultures subsequently return positive for yeast. The organism responsible for this patient's
bloodstream infection is most likely to exhibit which of the following characteristics?

() A. Broad-based budding morphology

©) B. Endemic to southwestern United States
©, C. Positive India ink stain
