This patient who has a central venous catheter and is receiving parenteral nutrition has sepsis
(fever, tachycardia) with blood cultures growing yeast. Patients receiving parenteral nutrition
(through a central venous catheter) are at high risk for candidemia (Candida in the
bloodstream). Candida can colonize the catheter, and the lipid emulsion in the parenteral
nutrition solution is thought to promote the growth of some Candida species. The morphology
of Candida includes branching pseudohyphae with blastoconidia (budding cells). Most
species are susceptible to echinocandins, and C albicans is nearly always susceptible to
fluconazole.
