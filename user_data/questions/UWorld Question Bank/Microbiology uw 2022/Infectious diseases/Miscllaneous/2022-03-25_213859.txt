(Choice G) Meningiomas are not associated with immunosuppressive diseases, nor are they
associated with EBV. Meningiomas are located adjacent to the brain surface and are attached
to the dura mater.

(Choice H) Craniopharyngiomas are located in the suprasellar region and can be calcified.
Craniopharyngiomas can cause visual disturbances and endocrinopathies (such as
hypopituitarism).

(Choice I) Intracranial schwannomas are most commonly located at the cerebellopontine
angle. They cause symptoms of CN VIII compression (hearing loss, tinnitus, loss of balance).

Educational Objective:

Primary CNS lymphomas occur in immunosuppressed patients, such as those suffering from
AIDS. These tumors arise from B cells and are universally associated with EBV. They are
high-grade tumors with a poor prognosis.
