Vaccines given in series (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) typically trigger the following
immunologic changes:

Â¢ Primary response: Upon initial vaccination, foreign antigen binds to and activates B
lymphocytes with compatible antigen receptors, leading to clonal B-cell expansion and
differentiation into short-lived plasma cells that secrete low-affinity IgM. Early
production of IgM can be detected in the serum within a few days of immunization. APCs
also ingest the peptide and travel to regional lymph nodes where they stimulate CD4 T
lymphocytes to interact with activated B cells. This interaction facilitates immunoglobulin
class switching from IgM to other types (eg, IgG, IgA) and stimulates B-cell differentiation
into memory B cells. Plasma cells secrete high-affinity IgG, and levels peak a few weeks
after immunization (after IgM peaks) before slowly waning (Choices B and E).

Secondary response: subsequent vaccination or pathogen exposure results in a IgM
response similar to initial vaccination due to stimulation of antigen-specific naive B
lymphocytes. However, the previously formed memory B cells quickly differentiate into
long-lasting plasma cells to produce a rapid and sustained IgG response that peaks
around the same time as the IgM response but is greater in magnitude (Choices C and
D). IgG rapidly neutralizes invading organisms and is responsible for the protective effects
