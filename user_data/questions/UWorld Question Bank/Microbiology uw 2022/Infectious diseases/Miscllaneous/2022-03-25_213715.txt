Although B cells are the primary players in inducing a vaccine response, T cells play a key
role in enabling high-affinity antibodies and immunological memory. Most vaccinations use
peptide antigens or nonpeptides bonded to peptides (ie, conjugate vaccine) so the antigen can
be displayed on MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to a
much stronger T-cell-mediated immune response.
