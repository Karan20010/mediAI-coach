Growth restriction, microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and a diffuse dark-blue rash (ie,
blueberry muffin rash) are nonspecific features shared by multiple congenital (TORCH)
infections (eg, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella). These infections are transmitted
transplacentally to the fetus from a mother infected during pregnancy. Although maternal
symptoms may be mild (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy), the developing fetus can have
significant morbidity, particularly with a first trimester infection.

Serology and polymerase chain reaction testing can help to determine the diagnosis in a
neonate with suspected intrauterine infection. Neonatal antibody titers can be difficult to
interpret, particularly due to maternal transfer of some antibodies and not others:

Â¢ Maternal IgM does not cross the placenta, so detection of organism-specific IgM in a
symptomatic neonate is diagnostic.

e At birth, virtually all infant IgG is maternally derived IgG that crossed the placenta, and
elevated maternal IgG would be expected in this mother with infectious symptoms 6-7
months prior to delivery (Choices A and D). Therefore, organism-specific newborn IgG
(eg, Toxoplasma |gG) will also be elevated in the setting of a past maternal infection.
