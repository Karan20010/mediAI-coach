symptomatic patients include the following:

¢ Snuffles: Copious, persistent rhinorrhea develops after age 1 week. It is caused by
erosions of the mucosa in the nasal cavity, and discharge may be clear/white, bloody, or
purulent.

¢ Maculopapular rash: Lesions usually develop after the onset of rhinorrhea, classically
involving the palms, soles, and buttocks, and then desquamate. The rash may be
associated with fissures near orifices (eg, anal, oral).

¢ Skeletal anomalies: Symmetric and bilateral long bone involvement can cause pain,
swelling, and limited movement.
