fluconazole.

(Choice A) Broad-based budding is characteristic of Blastomyces. This organism can cause

pulmonary infection and occasional dissemination, but bloodstream infection in the setting of a

vascular catheter is unlikely.

(Choice B) Coccidioides is a dimorphic fungus endemic to the southwestern United States.
This organism is inhaled and can cause pulmonary infection with occasional dissemination,
particularly among immunocompromised patients.

(Choice C) Cryptococcus is a yeast with a thick capsule that does not absorb India ink,
resulting in a clear halo that can aid in the diagnosis of cryptococcal infection. The most
common cryptococcal infection is meningitis, particularly among immunocompromised
patients. Fungemia in the setting of a vascular catheter is uncommon.

(Choice E) Right-angle branching hyphae are characteristic of mucormycosis, a mold
infection primarily due to Mucorales or Rhizopus species. These infections can cause invasive
disease in immunocompromised patients, including angioinvasive infections, but the
organisms do not grow in blood cultures and are not associated with intravascular catheters.
