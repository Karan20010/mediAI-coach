(Choice A) Maternal Chlamydia infection is transmitted to the neonate via exposure to genital

secretions during delivery. Symptomatic infection in the infant includes conjunctivitis or
pneumonia; bony lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and diffuse lymphadenopathy do not occur.

(Choice B) Transmission of HIV may occur through breastfeeding, and infection should be
considered in an infant who has hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy and whose
mother received inconsistent prenatal care. Acute infection may be associated with joint or
muscle pain, but metaphyseal erosions and periosteal inflammation make this diagnosis less
likely. Moreover, symptomatic infants with HIV typically have persistent diarrhea and recurrent
infections (eg, thrush, pneumonia).

(Choice C) Osteomyelitis in infants leads to extremity pain and decreased movement, and
Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause. Most young infants with nosocomial
transmission have risk factors (eg, prematurity, prior bacterial infection, history of central line),
none of which are seen here. In addition, patients usually have fever, particularly if the
infection is multifocal, and hepatosplenomegaly would not be expected.

(Choice E) Infection due to transplacental transmission of a tachyzoite describes congenital
toxoplasmosis, which may cause hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy; chorioretinitis
and intracranial calcifications are typical. However, tender, swollen joints with bony erosions
