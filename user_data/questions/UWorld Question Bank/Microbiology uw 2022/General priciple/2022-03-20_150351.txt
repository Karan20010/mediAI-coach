(Choice B) Like other herpesviruses, cytomegalovirus requires initial contact with
glycosaminoglycan chains on host cell surface proteoglycans for entry into the host cell. It

does not require contact with CD21.

(Choice D) HIV viruses attach to their major target host cells (CD4- T cells) primarily via the

binding of viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cellular CD4 transmembrane glycoprotein
and the coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). The HIV envelope then undergoes a conformational

change that activates gp41 and initiates membrane fusion.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 is thought to attach to human erythroid cells via the blood group P
antigen (globoside), which is expressed by mature erythrocytes, erythroid progenitors,
megakaryocytes, placenta, and the fetal liver and heart. Immature cells of the erythroid family
(eg, adult bone marrow, fetal liver) are most vulnerable to parvovirus B19 infection.

Educational objective:

The initial attachment of the virion envelope or capsid surface proteins to the complementary
host cell surface receptors is essential to viral tropism for specific tissues and invasion of
cells. Many viruses bind to normal host cell plasma membrane receptors to enter host cells.
Known host cell receptor and virion/virion protein binding specificities include: CD4 with HIV
gp120, CD21 with Epstein-Barr virus gp350, and erythrocyte P antigen with parvovirus B19.
