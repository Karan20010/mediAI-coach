Question Id: 376

This patient's fever and joint pain are nonspecific symptoms of a viral infection. Atypical
(reactive) lymphocytes are also nonspecific and are seen with many viral infections (although
Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus usually present with the highest counts).

Based on the described viral morphology, this patient is most likely infected with the hepatitis B
virus (HBV), a member of the DNA-containing Hepadnaviridae family. The mature virion
(called a Dane particle) consists of a hexagonal protein core (capsid) covered with a lipid
bilayer envelope studded with proteins and carbohydrates. The HBV genome is a partially
double-stranded circular DNA molecule housed within the capsid.

After the virion enters the cell, the capsid is released into the cytoplasm and the viral genome
is transferred into the nucleus. The viral DNA is then repaired to form a fully double-stranded
circular minichromosome that is capable of being transcribed into viral mRNAs. Replication of
the genome occurs within a newly synthesized capsid containing the full-length viral MRNA
transcript. Reverse transcriptase (which has both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA-
polymerase activity) acts on this RNA template to create a single-stranded DNA intermediate
that is then converted back into circular, partially double-stranded DNA. The mature capsid is
then enveloped by a portion of the endoplasmic reticulum containing virally-coded proteins to

form the completed virion.
