(Choices A and B) The envelope proteins of HCV are not lost after recurrent viral replication
nor are they sequestered within hepatocytes. These proteins are necessary for viral infectivity
as they mediate membrane adhesion and fusion with host hepatocytes.

(Choice C) Like most foreign (nonself) proteins, the envelope proteins of HCV are highly
immunogenic.

(Choice E) Host antibodies against HCV have neutralizing properties and are effective in
eliminating more established hepatitis C quasispecies. It is the constantly emerging mutant
strains that pose the greatest challenge to the host immune system.
