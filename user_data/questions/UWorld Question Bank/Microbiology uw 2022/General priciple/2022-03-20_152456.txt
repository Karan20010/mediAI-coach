This patient who recently underwent a genitourinary procedure (cystoscopy) has a urinary tract
infection caused by Enterococcus. This organism has a morphology of gram-positive cocci
in pairs and chains and, when grown on blood agar, reveals no hemolysis (gamma
hemolysis). Other characteristics of enterococci include pyrrolidony! arylamidase (PYR)
positivity and ability to grow in bile and in 6.5% sodium chloride. They are unable to convert
nitrates to nitrites, explaining this patient's negative result on urinalysis nitrite.

Enterococci are part of the normal intestinal flora of humans and animals. Enterococcus
faecalis and E faecium are the most prevalent species cultured from humans and can cause
urinary tract infection, bacteremia/endocarditis, wound infection, or intraabdominal or pelvic
infection in the nosocomial setting. Enterococci have both intrinsic (beta-lactams, macrolides,
aminoglycosides, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and acquired (vancomycin) resistance to
antibiotics, making them important nosocomial pathogens.
