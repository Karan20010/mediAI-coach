This patient had self-limited traveler's diarrhea, which is most commonly caused by
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), a gram-negative, motile, enteric rod bacterium.
Patients traveling to resource-limited regions with poor sanitation are at greatest risk.

Following ingestion, ETEC colonizes and adheres to small intestine enterocytes (mediated by
pili). The typical manifestations of abdominal cramping, nausea/vomiting, and (occasionally)
low-grade fever occur due to the elaboration of plasmid-encoded heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-
stable (ST) enterotoxins:

e The LT enterotoxin, which resembles cholera toxin in structure and mode of action,
increases cyclic AMP in gut mucosal cells by activating adenylate cyclase.
Â¢ The ST enterotoxin (which is not inactivated by heat likely due to its small molecular

size) causes an increase in cyclic GMP by activating guanylate cyclase.

Both mechanisms result in increased chloride secretion and decreased sodium reabsorption
by enterocytes, resulting in watery diarrhea.
