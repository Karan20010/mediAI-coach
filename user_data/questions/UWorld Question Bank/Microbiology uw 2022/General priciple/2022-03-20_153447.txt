Malaria is a mosquito-borne, protozoal infection caused by Plasmodium species.
Transmission occurs when an infected female Anopheles mosquito injects Plasmodium
sporozoites into subcutaneous capillaries during feeding. Within hours, sporozoites attach to
and enter hepatocytes and undergo asexual reproduction. This results in the production of
tens of thousands of daughter cells (merozoites) that eventually rupture the hepatocyte and
spread to erythrocytes, where another asexual reproduction cycle occurs.

Manifestations of malaria arise due to erythrocyte rupture and include fever, flu-like
symptoms (eg, myalgia, fatigue, headache, chills), anemia, and indirect bilirubinemia
(hepatosplenomegaly is also common). The diagnosis is confirmed when trophozoites
(intraerythrocytic, ringed inclusions) are seen on peripheral blood smear using Giemsa stain.
