(Choices A â€” D) The lac operon, which codes for all three aforementioned proteins, is
regulated by a single operator, a promoter, and a single group of regulatory elements: an
inducer, repressor, and catabolite activator protein. Modulation of the transcription of this
operon through binding of the operator and action of the repressor or other regulatory
elements will change the transcription of all three /ac-operon structural genes (z, y, and a). On
the other hand, there are no operators, repressors, or inducers that can desynchronize the
transcription of lac-operon structural genes.
