Educational objective:

Facial pain, headache, and a black necrotic eschar in the nasal cavity of a patient with diabetic
ketoacidosis are highly suggestive of mucormycosis. Histologic examination of the affected
tissue is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The fungi show broad nonseptate hyphae with
right-angle branching. Treatment consists of surgical debridement and antifungal therapy.
