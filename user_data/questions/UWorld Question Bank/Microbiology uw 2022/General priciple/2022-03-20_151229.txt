The influenza A virus uses a sialic acid as a receptor for cellular entry. The chemical
composition of the specific type of sialic acid that the virus interacts with differs among animal
species. The avian influenza virus attaches to a specific sialic acid that is present in fowl
epithelial cells but absent in human cells, whereas the human influenza virus can only attach
to the type of sialic acid present in human respiratory epithelium. When pig epithelial cells,
which contain both types of sialic acid, are infected with the combination of avian and human
influenza A viruses, some of the new avian influenza viral particles become capable of
attaching to human cells. However, the progeny of this new strain of avian influenza virus is
still unable to attach to human epithelial cells. Which of the following phenomena best
describes the change in the avian influenza virus in this experiment?

A. Interference (1%)

YS B. Phenotypic mixing (42%)
C. Reassortment (32%)
D. Recombination (12%)

E. Transformation (9%)
