(Choice A) The ability to decompose hydrogen peroxide is suggestive of the presence of
catalase, which would indicate Staphylococcus (which are gram-positive cocci in clusters not
chains).

(Choice C) Enterococci are aerobic organisms. Examples of anaerobic gram-positive cocci

include Peptostreptococcus and Micrococcus.

(Choice D) Oxidase positivity (possession of cytochrome oxidase) can help identify certain
gram-negative organisms (eg, Pseudomonas).

(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus produces golden yellow pigments. Other bacteria
producing pigments include Pseudomonas aeruginosa (blue-green) and Serratia marcescens
(red).
