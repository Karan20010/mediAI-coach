(Choice A) Coxsackie virus is within the Picornaviridae family and is composed of an

icosahedral nucleocapsid and a + single-stranded RNA genome. The RNA has a protein on

the 5' end that acts as a primer for transcription by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.

(Choices B and C) Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are members of the
Herpesviridae family. All viruses within this family contain an icosahedral core surrounded by a
lipoprotein envelope and have double-stranded, linear DNA. These are the only viruses to

acquire their envelopes by budding from the nuclear membrane.

(Choice E) Human immunodeficiency virus is within the Lentivirus subgroup of retroviruses. It
contains a bar-shaped protein core surrounded by a glycoprotein envelope that includes the
gp120 and gp41 glycoproteins. The genome is diploid, consisting of 2 + single-stranded RNA
molecules that are transcribed into double-stranded DNA by a reverse transcriptase present in

the capsid.

(Choice F) Parvovirus B19 is a small nonenveloped icosahedral virus with a linear, single-
stranded DNA genome. There is no polymerase in the virion.

Educational objective:
Replication of the hepatitis B genome occurs within a newly synthesized capsid through the

action of reverse transcriptase on an RNA template. The mature capsid contains partiall
