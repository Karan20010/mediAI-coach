Certain strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae express capsular polysaccharides that inhibit
phagocytosis, making it a successful pathogen. Strains lacking the capsule are not
pathogenic; however, S pneumoniae is able to obtain new genetic material from the
environment that is released following the death and lysis of neighboring bacterial cells. This
process, known as transformation, allows the bacterium to take up exogenous DNA
fragments, integrate the DNA into its genome, and express the encoded proteins. Through
this method, nonvirulent strains of S pneumoniae that do not form a capsule can acquire the
genes that code for the capsule and therefore gain virulence.

Bacteria that have the innate capacity to undergo transformation are said to be naturally
competent and include Haemophilus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Neisseria species.
