(Choice B) Hepatitis A-E viruses replicate within mature hepatocytes and cause inflammation
and cell necrosis. Hepatitis B and C are chronic infections and the most common causes of
cirrhosis and liver cancer.

(Choice C) Rotavirus replicates in fully differentiated intestinal epithelial cells. The infected
and damaged enterocytes slough into the intestinal lumen, leading to profuse watery diarrhea.

(Choice D) Mature lymphocytes are a common site of viral replication (eg, human
herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6], HIV). HH\V-6 causes roseola infantum, which presents as high fever
followed by a diffuse maculopapular rash in children age <2.

(Choice E) Many common viruses (eg, influenza, parainfluenza, rhinovirus) replicate within
respiratory epithelial cells (but not their precursors). Parainfluenza replication, for example,
can be localized to only nasal and pharyngeal epithelium (eg, rhinorrhea, sore throat) or can
spread more extensively, causing laryngotracheitis (croup), bronchiolitis, or pneumonia.
