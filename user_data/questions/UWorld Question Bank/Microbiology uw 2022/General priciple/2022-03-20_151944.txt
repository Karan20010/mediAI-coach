Educational Objective:

Bacterial mRNA can be polycistronic, meaning that one mRNA codes for several proteins. An
example of polycistronic mRNA is the bacterial lac operon, which codes for the proteins
necessary for lactose metabolism by E. coli; the transcription and translation of these bacterial
proteins is regulated by a single promoter, operator, and set of regulatory elements.
