(Choice A) Interference occurs when one virus inhibits replication and/or release of a second
virus that is infecting the same cell. Simple interference would not result in a new phenotype
for progeny.
(Choice C) Reassortment refers to changes in genomic composition that occur when host

cells are coinfected with 2 segmented viruses that exchange whole genome segments. When
reassortment takes place in a cell coinfected by 2 viral strains, any genomic change in first
generation progeny will also be present in subsequent progeny.

(Choice D) Recombination may be defined as the exchange of genes between 2
chromosomes (double-stranded DNA molecules) by crossing over within homologous regions.
As is the case with reassortment, any genomic change in the first generation progeny will also
be present in subsequent progeny.

(Choice E) Transformation is generally defined as naked DNA uptake by a prokaryotic or
eukaryotic cell. In virology, this term may also describe incorporation of viral DNA into a host
cell chromosome. Transformation alters the genetic composition of the host cell but typically
causes no genomic change in progeny virions.
