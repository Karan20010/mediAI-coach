Educational objective:

Staphylococcus epidermidis, a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters, is a skin
commensal that is a common cause of infection in patients with prosthetic devices such as
artificial joints or heart valves. Unlike S aureus, S epidermidis is coagulase-negative. Unlike S
Saprophyticus (another coagulase-negative staphylococci species), S epidermidis is
susceptible to novobiocin.
