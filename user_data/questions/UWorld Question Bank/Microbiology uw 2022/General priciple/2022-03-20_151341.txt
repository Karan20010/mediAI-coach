Staphylococcus epidermidis is a |ow-virulence skin commensal that rarely causes infection
in healthy patients. However, those with prosthetic devices (eg, indwelling catheters, artificial
heart valves, artificial joints) are at risk because the pathogen produces adhesion and biofilm
proteins that allow it to grow on artificial surfaces. S epidermidis is one of the most common
contaminants of blood cultures, but infection should be suspected when multiple blood cultures
grow the bacteria and/or the patient has symptoms of clinical infection such as fever, malaise,

and leukocytosis.

Staphylococcus species are gram-positive cocci that grow in grape-like clusters. They are
differentiated from streptococci by the catalase test: Streptococci are catalase-negative
whereas staphylococci are catalase-positive (Choice C). Further speciation of staphylococci
leverages the coagulase test (the ability to clot blood plasma), which differentiates S aureus
from coagulase-negative staphylococci such as S epidermidis, S haemolyticus, and S
Saprophyticus.
