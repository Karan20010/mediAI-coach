(Choice B) In transduction, a bacteriophage (virus) transfers DNA from one bacterial cell to
another. While replicating within a host bacterium, a bacteriophage may accidentally
incorporate host bacterial DNA into the phage particle. Once released, it can then transfer
DNA from the previous host into a newly infected bacterium. By this mechanism, bacteria can
acquire genes for virulence and antibiotic resistance.

(Choice C) Conjugation is a form of one-way DNA transfer performed by bacteria carrying a
plasmid with the fertility (F) factor. The process begins with the donating bacterium producing
a sex pilus, which then forms a direct connection with the receiving bacterium. Next, the
donating bacterium transfers a single DNA strand containing the F factor to the recipient
organism, after which, complementary DNA strands are synthesized.

(Choice D) Spontaneous or induced mutations change the nucleotide sequence of a gene,
potentially altering the amino acid sequence of the protein product. Through this mechanism,
bacteria form novel proteins with potentially useful functions to aid with survival.

(Choice E) Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can mediate DNA transfer from
plasmids to a bacterial chromosome, move genetic material from one position to another along
a bacterial chromosome, or transfer genes from a bacterial chromosome to a plasmid. The
location of a gene in the genome is important as it determines its proximity to promoter or
