The /ac operon is the sequence of the E. coli genome which is required for the metabolism of
lactose. The /ac operon consists of a regulatory gene (/), promoter region (p), operator region
(0), and three structural genes (z, y, and a). The z gene codes for B-galactosidase (B-gal),
which is primarily responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose. The y
gene codes for permease, a transmembrane enzyme that increases the permeability of the cell
to lactose. The a gene encodes a B-galactoside transacetylase, which transfers acetyl groups
to B-galactosides and is unnecessary for lactose metabolism by E. coli.

In prokaryotes, one mRNA transcript contains the sequences for many proteins, and a single
mRNA molecule can be translated into multiple proteins or polypeptides. For instance, all
three proteins of the /Jac operon (B-galactosidase, permease, and transacetylase) are
synthesized from a single MRNA molecule containing the z, y, and a gene sequences,
respectively. Transcription and translation of the genes of the /ac operon is typically
synchronous. Remember that a single mRNA molecule which codes for more than one protein
is referred to as a polycistronic mRNA, and while most prokaryotic mRNA molecules are
polycistronic, eukaryotic MRNA is rarely polycistronic.
