Although both influenza and the common cold can be associated with upper respiratory
symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat), influenza can often be differentiated based on
the abrupt onset of symptoms and the presence of nonspecific, systemic manifestations
(eg, fever, malaise, myalgias, headache).

The influenza virus is an enveloped orthomyxovirus with a segmented, negative-sense, single-
stranded RNA genome. Transmission occurs via contaminated, large-particle droplets.
Therefore, patients who are hospitalized with influenza generally require droplet precautions
(mask and gown for health care providers), and close contacts should be advised to practice
appropriate hand hygiene.

Alcohol-based disinfectants, which are composed of ethyl or isopropyl! alcohol (at
concentrations of 60%-90%) in water, are often used for hand hygiene. These solutions kill
vegetative bacteria (but not spores), fungus, and enveloped viruses (eg, influenza, HIV,
herpes) by dissolving their lipid bilayer membranes and subsequently denaturing their
proteins. Nonenveloped viruses such as adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and poliovirus
are less susceptible to some alcohol-based disinfectants (particularly isopropyl-based
solutions) because they do not have a lipid bilayer envelope.
