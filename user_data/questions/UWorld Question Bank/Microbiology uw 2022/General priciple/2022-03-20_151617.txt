Question Id: 736

Microbiology researchers conduct a series of experiments to determine how pathogenicity is
transmitted among different strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae. In the first experiment, they
inject nonvirulent strain A into the peritoneal cavity of laboratory mice and observe no ill
effects. In the second experiment, researchers subject virulent strain B to a detergent agent
that kills and lyses the bacterial cells. They then inject the lysate into the peritoneal cavity of a
new group of mice and again observe no ill effects. During a third experiment, they inject live
strain A bacteria in combination with the killed strain B lysate, resulting in death of the mice.
Which of the following genetic processes most likely accounts for the observed findings of
these experiments?

JY _ A. Direct uptake of extracellular DNA (73%)
B. Phage-mediated DNA transfer (11%)
C. Pilus-mediated DNA transfer (8%)
D. Spontaneous DNA mutation (0%)

E. Transposon-mediated DNA transfer (5%)
