This patient with fever, dysuria, and flank pain has bacterial growth in the urine, findings
diagnostic of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Escherichia coli, a motile, gram-negative
bacillus, is the most common cause of UTI and grows well on blood, MacConkey, and eosin
methylene blue (EMB) agar plates. Due to its ability to ferment lactose, E coli binds to dye in
the EMB agar and produces colonies that have a distinct green metallic sheen; most strains of
E coli also demonstrate beta-hemolysis on blood agar.

Varying strains of E coli have specific virulence factors that determine disease characteristics;
in the case of urinary tract infections, P fimbriae (pyelonephritis-associated pili) are the
primary virulence factors due to their ability to adhere to uroepithelium.

Normally, E coli is a commensal bacterium in the intestinal tract; however, it can spread from
the perianal region to the periurethral regions (eg, via sexual intercourse or bladder
catheterization). P fimbriae allow uropathogenic E coli to ascend into the bladder, ureters, and
kidneys, leading to cystitis and pyelonephritis.
