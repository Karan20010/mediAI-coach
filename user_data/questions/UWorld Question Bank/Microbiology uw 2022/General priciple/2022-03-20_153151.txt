Educational objective:

Giardia lamblia causes injury to the duodenal and jejunal mucosa by adhering to the intestinal
brush border and releasing molecules that induce a mucosal inflammatory response.
Secretory IgA, which impairs adherence, is the major component of adaptive immunity against
G lamblia infection. Conditions causing IgA deficiency predispose patients to chronic

giardiasis.
