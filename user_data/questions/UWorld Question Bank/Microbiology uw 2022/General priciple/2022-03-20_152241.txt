(Choice A) Clostridioides difficile produces toxin A (enterotoxin) and toxin B (cytotoxin). In
contrast to Shiga toxin, toxin A primarily initiates an inflammatory response, whereas toxin B
depolymerizes actin filaments, causing gastrointestinal mucosal cell death.

(Choice B) Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces exotoxin A, which is similar in function to
diphtheria toxin in that it halts human cellular protein synthesis by inhibiting elongation factor
2. Although Shiga toxin also disrupts protein synthesis, it does so via a different mechanism
(inhibition of the 60S ribosomal subunit).

(Choice C) Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever, which is characterized by fever, abdominal
pain, diarrhea and/or constipation, and faintly erythematous macules on the abdomen (rose
spots). The bacterium penetrates the intestinal mucosa and releases typhoid toxin (not Shiga
toxin), which damages cellular DNA.

(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus typically causes a vomiting-predominant foodborne illness
with or without watery diarrhea due to a preformed toxin. Unlike Shiga toxin, this enterotoxin is
not cytotoxic.

(Choice F) Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, produces choleragen, which acts
similarly to the heat-labile toxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. \t increases intracellular

cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosal cells, leading to decreased absorption and increased
Block Time Elapse
