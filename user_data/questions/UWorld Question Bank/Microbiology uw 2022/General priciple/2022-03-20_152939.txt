A virologist is researching acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV). Viral DNA analysis
reveals a mutation in the thymidine kinase gene, resulting in a mutated enzyme that does not
phosphorylate acyclovir to its active form. In an experiment, a resistant HSV type 2 strain
containing this mutation is cultured in a cell line, and the cell culture is coinfected with a
nonresistant HSV type 1 strain. It is found that some of the newly produced type 1 virions
acquire resistance to acyclovir, and subsequent progeny continue to be resistant. Which of the
following mechanisms best explains the observed findings?

A. Interference (0%)

B. Phenotypic mixing (9%)

C. Reassortment (21%)
YD. Recombination (40%)

E. Transformation (28%)
