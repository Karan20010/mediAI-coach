Educational objective:

Viridans streptococci are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity and are a cause of transient
bacteremia after dental procedures in healthy and diseased individuals. In patients with pre-
existing valvular lesions, viridans streptococci can adhere to fibrin-platelet aggregates and
establish infection that leads to endocarditis.
