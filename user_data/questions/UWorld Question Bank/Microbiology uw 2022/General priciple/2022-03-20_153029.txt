(Choice A) Interference occurs when one virus inhibits replication and/or release of a second
virus that is infecting the same cell. Simple interference would not result in recombinant
progeny virions.

(Choice B) Phenotypic mixing can occur when a host cell is coinfected with 2 viral strains and
progeny virions contain parental genome from one strain and nucleocapsid (or envelope)
proteins from the other strain. This may result in progeny acquiring additional traits (eg,
enhanced ability to infect new host cells due to different nucleocapsid proteins). However, as
the genome is unchanged, subsequent progeny would not retain these traits.

(Choice C) Reassortment refers to changes in genomic composition that occur when host
cells are coinfected with 2 segmented viruses that exchange whole genome segments. This
process can cause sudden alterations in surface antigens of the viral progeny, as observed
with the highly mutagenic influenza virus. However, because the herpesvirus genome is

nonsegmented, it does not engage in reassortment.

(Choice E) Transformation is the uptake of naked DNA by a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell. In
virology, transformation also describes incorporation of viral DNA into a host cell chromosome
(lysogeny). Transformation alters the genetic composition of the host cell but typically causes

no genomic change in progeny virions.
