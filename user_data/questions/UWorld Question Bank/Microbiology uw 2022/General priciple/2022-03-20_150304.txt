(Choices C, D, and E) Following influenza attachment and endocytosis, the viral bilayer
envelope fuses with the endosome membrane, which liberates the nucleocapsid protein
(bound to the RNA genome), viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and viral MRNA
endonuclease into the cytoplasm. These travel to the nucleus to initiate viral replication.
Although mutations to these proteins could affect viral replication, they would be unlikely to
alter tissue tropism because they are not on the surface of the virus and, therefore, do not
mediate viral attachment.

Educational objective:

The tissue tropism of viruses is primarily mediated by viral surface glycoproteins that bind to
specific host cell receptors. Mutations to viral surface glycoproteins can alter tissue tropism
and cause noninfective viruses to become infectious.
