Educational objective:

Plasmodium vivax is the most common cause of malaria in non-African countries. It is
transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito and is associated with a latent liver phase that
must be treated (with primaquine) independently of the erythrocytic phase to fully eliminate the

organism.
