The /ac operon consists of a regulatory gene (/ac /), a promoter region (/ac p), an operator
region (/ac o), and three structural genes (lac Z, lac Y, and lac A). The lac Z gene codes for B-
galactosidase, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of lactose to glucose and galactose. The
lac Y gene codes for permease, which allows lactose to enter the bacterium. The /ac p region
is the binding site for RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription. The Lac |
repressor protein is the product of the /ac / gene and is constitutively expressed. Repressor
proteins, when bound to the operator region, prevent binding of RNA polymerase to the
promoter region, thus decreasing transcription of the /ac Z, lac Y, and lac A genes. Culture of
E coli in lactose-containing media causes a conformational change in the repressor protein,
preventing its attachment to the operator region and increasing transcription of the Jac operon

structural genes.

Culturing E coli in media containing glucose results in reduced expression of the /ac operon,
even when the media contains lactose as well. This occurs because the /ac operon is
positively regulated by the binding of catabolite activator protein (CAP) to a site slightly
upstream from the promoter region. This only occurs when cAMP concentrations are high.
Since glucose decreases the activity of adenylyl cyclase (reducing intracellular cAMP), the /ac
operon is repressed in high-glucose conditions. In summary, the /ac operon is regulated by 2
