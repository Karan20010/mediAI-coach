(Choice A) Clostridioides difficile produces 2 exotoxins, one of which is a cytotoxin (toxin B)
that disrupts the cytoskeleton by depolymerizing actin and causing cell death.

(Choice C) Exotoxins produced by Corynebacterium diphtheriae (diphtheria toxin) inactivate
elongation factor 2 via ribosylation, which leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis and cell
death.

(Choices D and E) Unlike STEC, enterotoxigenic E coli produces heat-labile toxin (LT) and
heat-stable toxin (ST). LT increases intracellular cyclic AMP in intestinal mucosal cells, which
leads to the decreased absorption and increased secretion of sodium, chloride, and water; ST
increases intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), also contributing to diarrhea
and electrolyte loss. Watery, not bloody, diarrhea occurs.
