Giardia lamblia is an intestinal flagellate that exists in 2 forms: a trophozoite (pathogenic
stage) or a cyst (infective stage). The trophozoite is a bilaterally symmetric, pear-shaped
organism with multiple flagella and 2 nuclei (owl's eyes appearance); the cysts are oval and
contain up to 4 nuclei. The disease is transmitted by drinking contaminated water (eg,
campers, travelers to endemic areas) or via fecal-oral transmission (eg, children in day care
centers).

Giardiasis can be asymptomatic or present with a variable combination of diarrhea, nausea,
abdominal cramps, and fat malabsorption (eg, foul-smelling stools). The diagnosis is
confirmed by stool microscopy for ova and parasites or fecal immunoassays for Giardia
antigens. Small-bowel biopsy is sometimes performed when stool studies are nondiagnostic
and can show varying degrees of villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia depending on disease
severity.

Immune defence against Giardia involves CD4+ T helper cell induction of secretory IgA
production. Secretory IgA helps prevent and clear infection by binding to trophozoites and
impairing their adherence to the upper small-bowel mucosa. Children with IgA deficiency, X-
linked agammaglobulinemia, and common variable immune deficiency have a predisposition to
developing chronic giardiasis.
