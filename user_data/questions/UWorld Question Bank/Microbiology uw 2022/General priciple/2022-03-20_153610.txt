Dimorphic fungus — mold in environment, yeast at body

. . temperature
Epidemiology ; ; ccieeinn: Bi
e Endemic to Ohio & Mississippi River Valleys
¢ Soil contaminated by bird or bat droppings
¢ Inhaled — phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages — escapes
Pathophysiology| lysosome destruction — spreads to hilar/mediastinal lymph nodes

Controlled by cell-mediated immune response (granulomas)

Disease course

Immunocompetent: Asymptomatic (primarily) or self-limited
pneumonia with mediastinal/hilar lymphadenopathy

¢ Immunocompromised: Disseminated disease through liver,

spleen, or bone marrow

Diagnosis

Urine antigen testing
Biopsy with histopathology — granulomas & macrophages with
intracellular ovoid/round yeast
