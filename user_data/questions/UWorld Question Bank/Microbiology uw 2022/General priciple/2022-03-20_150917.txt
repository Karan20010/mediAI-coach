This patient has bloody diarrhea due to Escherichia coli 0157:H7, or Shiga toxinâ€”producing
E coli (STEC). The transmission of STEC occurs primarily via consumption of contaminated
beef products, but isolated cases without a clear source can occur.

After colonization and adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, STEC elaborates Shiga toxin
(virtually identical to that produced by Shigella dysenteriae). Enterocytes bind to Shiga toxins,
which then inactivate the 60S ribosomal subunit within the host cells by cleaving an adenine
nucleobase from the integrated 28S RNA. This leads to inhibition of protein synthesis and
apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Clinical manifestations include watery diarrhea that
becomes bloody within 1-3 days.

In a minority of cases, Shiga toxin can spread through the damaged intestinal epithelium to the
bloodstream and capillary endothelial cells in the kidney, leading to hemolytic uremic
syndrome approximately a week after gastrointestinal symptoms. Manifestations include
thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and renal insufficiency.
