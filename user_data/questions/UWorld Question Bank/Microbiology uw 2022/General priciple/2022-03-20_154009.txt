° (Choice A) Antigenic drift refers to point mutations in HA and NA genes that slightly alter the

: product proteins, allowing them to evade immune recognition and possibly increasing

® infectivity of the virus. However, a change in species-to-species transmission likely represents
; a major modification in protein structure that is better explained by RNA segment

= reassortment.

un (Choice B) In genetics, complementation occurs when 2 different strains of a mutant

S organism are able to produce wild-type offspring. Typically, both parents have homozygous

“ mutations in different genes within the same metabolic pathway. When they are crossed, the
= offspring inherits 1 normal allele from each parent, allowing them to bypass both of the

= metabolic blockades and display the wild-type phenotype.

19 (Choice C) Frameshift mutations result when a number of bases that are not a multiple of 3

. are added to or deleted from the coding region of a gene. This typically results in premature

, termination of translation and a truncated protein containing the wrong amino acids.

zs (Choice E) Phenotypic mixing occurs when 2 viruses infect the same cell and progeny viruses
= exhibit coat or envelope proteins not coded for by the genetic material packaged within them.
27 However, subsequent progeny express only the proteins encoded by their genome. The

. above scenario is not an example of phenotypic mixing as human-to-human transmission was
