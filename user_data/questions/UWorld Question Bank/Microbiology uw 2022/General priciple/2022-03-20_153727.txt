(Choice B) Aspergillus fumigatus is a monomorphic mold that can cause invasive disease in
those who are immunocompromised. This organism is inhaled into the lungs and can invade
the vascular endothelial lining, leading to dissemination through the bloodstream. However,

patients usually have fever, chest pain, and hemoptysis.

(Choice C) Candida species are part of the endogenous human flora, but overgrowth can
occur in those with immunocompromisation and lead to mucocutaneous (eg, thrush) or
invasive (pneumonia, fungemia) disease. Invasive Candida infections are generally diagnosed
by blood culture or biopsy with histopathology, not urine antigen testing.

(Choice D) Cryptococcus neoformans is a yeast with a thick, antiphagocytic, polysaccharide
capsule that primarily causes infections in those who are immunocompromised (particularly
patients with advanced AIDS). Although pulmonary infection can occur, disseminated disease
is usually marked by meningoencephalitis (eg, headache, confusion, altered mental state).

(Choice E) Malassezia is a dimorphic fungus that is part of normal skin flora. Conversion
from yeast form to the pathogenic mycelial form results in tinea versicolor, which is associated
with the characteristic spaghetti and meatballs appearance on microscopy (ie, both hyphae
and yeasts seen).
