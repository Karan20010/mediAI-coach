(Choice A) Coagulase positivity is a characteristic of S. aureus; this is how S. aureus is
differentiated from the other species of Staphylococci that do not express coagulase.

(Choice B) Hemolysis is a typical feature of Streptococci (streptolysin O and streptolysin S)
and Staphylococcus aureus (hemolysin). S. saprophyticus does not cause hemolysis.

(Choice D) DNase is produced by group A streptococcus. DNase degrades DNA in pus to
facilitate spread of the organism. Anti DNase can be used as a laboratory test in patients who
have had streptococcal infection followed by glomerulonephritis. DNase is not produced by S.
Saprophyticus.

(Choice E) Yellow pigment is produced by Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcus aureus
usually does not cause urinary tract infections. If S. aureus is cultured from the urine you

should suspect a metastatic infection from another location in the body (an abscess or
infective endocarditis etc.)
