This scenario describes the exchange of genetic information between 2 virus strains that have
nonsegmented, double-stranded DNA genomes. Recombination refers to the exchange of
genes between 2 chromosomes via crossing over within homologous regions. The resulting
progeny can have recombined genomes with traits from both parent viruses. In this case, the
thymidine kinase genes in HSV type 1 and 2 virions are likely to have significant sequence
similarity, allowing cross over to occur with relatively high frequency.
