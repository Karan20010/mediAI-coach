(Choice B) Shiga toxin is an exotoxin synthesized by enterohemorrhagic E coli, which
presents with bloody diarrhea. Meningitic strains of E coli do not produce Shiga toxin.

(Choices C and D) Lipid Aand O antigen are components of lipopolysaccharides, which
make up the majority of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Lipid Ais a major
virulence factor in the pathogenesis of septic shock (not meningitis) that causes widespread
release of IL-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; this patient with normal vital signs and
no evidence of end-organ dysfunction is not in septic shock. O antigen is a variable
polysaccharide on the outer surface and is used to classify gram-negative bacteria; it is nota
major virulence factor for invasive infection (including meningitis).

(Choice E) P-fimbriae (pili) enable E coli to adhere to uroepithelium, allowing infection of the
urinary tract (eg, cystitis, pyelonephritis), not the meninges.

Educational objective:

Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod, is a common cause of neonatal meningitis. The major
virulence factor for E coli strains that cause neonatal meningitis is the K1 capsular antigen,
which allows bacteria to survive in the bloodstream and invade the meninges.
