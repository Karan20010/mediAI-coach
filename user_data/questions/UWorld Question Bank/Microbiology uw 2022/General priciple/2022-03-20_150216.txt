Researchers are studying mechanisms of human infection by animal viruses. The
investigators induce random mutations in the genome of an avian influenza virus that is unable
to infect humans but is structurally similar to human influenza A virus. A mutated isolate is
found to be able to infect human upper respiratory tract epithelial cells. Alteration in which of
the following viral components most likely enabled this novel strain to cause cross-species
infection?
