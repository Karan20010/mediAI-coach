Educational objective:

Serum sickness is an immune complexâ€”mediated, type III hypersensitivity reaction that occurs
when immune complexes deposit in skin and joints and activate the classical complement
cascade. This generates the highly inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, leading to skin
rash, joint arthralgia/arthritis, and high fever.
