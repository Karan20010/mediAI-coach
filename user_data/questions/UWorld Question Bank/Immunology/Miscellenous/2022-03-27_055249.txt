patients generally have hypopigmentation and progressive neurologic dysfunction.

(Choice C) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is an inherited disorder associated with defective
adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes from the vasculature to tissues. Patients typically
have recurrent bacterial infections that begin in early childhood. It is not associated with
excessive plasma cells in the bone marrow.

(Choice D) Terminal complement deficiency (C5-C9) prevents the formation of the membrane
attack complex and dramatically increases the risk of recurrent infection with Neisseria
species; patients are usually healthy otherwise and have no abnormalities in the bone marrow.

(Choice E) Chronic granulomatous disease is a genetic disorder associated with severe
bacterial and fungal infections due to impaired ability of phagocytes to generate reactive
oxygen species (oxidative burst). Most cases present in early childhood, and plasma cell
effacement of the bone marrow would not be seen.

Educational objective:

Multiple myeloma is associated with the clonal proliferation of plasma cells in the bone
marrow. This prevents normal B-cell lymphogenesis and increases the risk of bacterial
infection due to decreased production of normal immunoglobulins.
