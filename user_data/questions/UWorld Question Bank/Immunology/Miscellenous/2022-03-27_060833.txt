undergo antibody class switching to IgE in B lymphocytes specific for these allergens.
Antigen-specific IgE produced by plasma cells binds to IgE receptors on basophils in the blood
and mast cells in the tissues. When the relevant antigen (allergen) interacts with cell bound-
specific IgE, these antibodies will cross-link, causing degranulation and release of chemical
mediators (histamine, prostaglandin, leukotrienes) responsible for systemic vasodilation,
increased vascular permeability, bronchoconstriction, and hemodynamic instability.

(Choice A) Antibody-antigen complex deposition in the vasculature occurs with Type III
hypersensitivity reactions (eg, serum sickness, Arthus reaction).

(Choice B) Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity occurs in type II hypersensitivity
reactions wherein IgM or IgG binds to antigens expressed on the cell surface. These
antibodies are then recognized by Fc receptors on immune cells, triggering the release of
perforin and granzymes that ultimately leads to cell lysis and death.
