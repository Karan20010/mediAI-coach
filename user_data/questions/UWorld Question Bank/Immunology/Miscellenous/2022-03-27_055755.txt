42 This patient developed erythema and pruritus on the scalp, face, and neck 2 days after

8 reexposure to hair dye. Hair products, including dye, frequently contain allergenic molecules

45 (eg, p-phenylenediamine) that can cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). ACD is a type

IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 phases:

18 1. Sensitization: Cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (small molecules that bind
» 19
2 to proteins and alter their immune appearance) and present hapten-peptide complexes to
at naive CD4- and CD8- T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of
22
23 hapten-sensitive T cells. This phase takes 10-14 days and does not result in cutaneous
* lesions.
25
. . 2. Elicitation: On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells are recruited to skin for
+ 28 activation by hapten-protein conjugates displayed on cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.

Activated CD8- T cells, the main effector cells in ACD, release cytotoxins (eg, perforin,

31 granzymes) and express Fas ligand to induce keratinocyte apoptosis. They also amplify
. the inflammatory response by releasing cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) and recruiting
+ 34 additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages). This phase occurs 2-3 days following

reexposure to the hapten and results in erythema, pruritus, and vesicles.
