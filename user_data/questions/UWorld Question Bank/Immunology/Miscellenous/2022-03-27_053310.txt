This patient is most likely experiencing an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction. This
condition presents with fever and chills, hypotension, dyspnea, chest and/or back pain, and
hemoglobinuria (red- to brown-colored urine). Patients may also develop disseminated
intravascular coagulation and renal failure. Acute hemolytic reactions occur within minutes to
hours of starting a blood transfusion and are most often due to ABO incompatibility between
the donor and recipient. These reactions can be fatal and require immediate cessation of the
transfusion when the diagnosis is suspected.

Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions are an example of an antibody-mediated (type II)
hypersensitivity reaction. Anti-ABO antibodies (mainly IgM) in the recipient bind the
corresponding antigens on transfused donor erythrocytes, leading to complement activation.
Anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) cause vasodilatation and symptoms of shock, while formation
of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9) leads to complement-mediated cell lysis.
Hemolytic disease of the newborn due to Rh-incompatibility is another example of type II
hypersensitivity.

(Choice A) Cytotoxic CD8- T-lymphocytes are responsible for destroying cells infected with
intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses). Recognition of an antigen-MHC class | complex by the T-
cell receptor activates CD8- lymphocytes, which then initiate apoptosis of the infected cell.
