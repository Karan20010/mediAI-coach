4. Tight adhesion and crawling: Neutrophils become firmly attached to the endothelium via

: : the binding of CD 18 beta 2 integrins (Mac-1 and LFA-1) to intercellular adhesion
8 molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells (Choices A and D).

5. Transmigration: After crawling to the endothelial cell periphery, neutrophils eventually
migrate out of the vasculature by squeezing in between the cells via integrin attachments
and adherence to platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1). This
protein is found primarily at the peripheral intercellular junctions of endothelial cells.

Three leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndromes have been identified whereby
leukocytes cannot leave the vasculature to migrate into tissues under conditions of

inflammation. All are rare, autosomal recessive disorders.

LAD type 1 results from the absence of CD18. This leads to the inability to synthesize the
beta-2 integrins Mac-1 and LFA1, affecting tight adhesion, crawling, and transmigration. The
clinical manifestations include recurrent skin infections without pus formation, delayed
detachment of the umbilical cord, and poor wound healing. LAD type 2 is a milder
condition, with no delay in the separation of the umbilical cord and less severe and fewer
