(Choice A) IgA is primarily a mucosal antibody. Patients with IgA deficiency can have an
anaphylactic reaction during the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin.

(Choice B) IgD is present in very low concentrations in the blood and is typically coexpressed
with IgM as a B-cell membrane receptor.

(Choice C) IgE plays a significant role in allergic responses and in the immune response to
parasitic infections.

(Choice E) Multivalent IgM antibodies are generally more effective than IgG antibodies at
promoting agglutination of foreign antigens and activating complement, which would result in
lysis of fetal erythrocytes in the maternal circulation. However, macrophages do not have
receptors for IgM; therefore, anti-D IgM does not provide the same immunoprophylactic effect
(eg, sequestration and clearance of Rh-positive erythrocytes) as anti-D IgG.

Educational objective:

Anti-Rh immunoglobulin consists of anti-D IgG antibodies that bind to Rh-positive fetal
erythrocytes, promoting clearance by maternal reticuloendothelial macrophages and
preventing maternal Rh sensitization. It is routinely administered to Rh-negative women

during gestation and immediately postpartum. Activate V
