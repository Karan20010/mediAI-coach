Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is caused by a mutation in hematologic stem
cells that eliminates production of an anchoring protein that attaches surface molecules to the
cell membrane. Loss of this membrane anchor prevents erythrocytes from expressing the
complement-inactivating surface proteins CD55 and CD59. Without these surface proteins,
autoactivated components of the alternative complement cascade cannot be disabled. This
leads to spontaneous complement amplification, the generation of membrane attack
complexes (MACs) on the red cell membrane, and subsequent complement-mediated
hemolysis.

Treatment with a monoclonal antibody (eg, eculizumab) that targets C5, the first complement
protein that contributes to the formation of MACs, can drastically reduce hemolysis and
improve symptoms (eg, fatigue) in patients with PNH. However, the generation of MACs is
crucial for defense against encapsulated organisms (eg, Neisseria meningitidis,
Streptococcus pneumoniae) because these pathogens are resistant to other host defense
mechanisms (eg, immunoglobulin binding, phagocytosis).

Patients receiving anti-C5 therapy require vaccination against encapsulated pathogens (N
meningitidis, S pneumoniae) and appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis (eg, penicillin) to prevent
fulminant infection.
