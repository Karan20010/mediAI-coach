Reactive (atypical) lymphocytes are activated, pathogen-specific cytotoxic T cells or natural
killer cells that form in response to certain intracellular infections. In contrast to normal
lymphocytes, reactive lymphocytes are large, scalloped, and have abundant cytoplasm.
Reactive lymphocytosis is a diagnostic feature of infectious mononucleosis.
