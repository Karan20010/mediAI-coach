Educational objective:

Hemolytic disease of the newborn most commonly occurs from maternal sensitization to Rh
antigens during a prior pregnancy with an Rh(D)+ fetus. In subsequent Rh(D)+ pregnancies,
maternal anti-Rh(D) IgG antibodies cross the placenta and cause a severe autoimmune
hemolytic anemia in the fetus and life-threatening hydrops fetalis.
