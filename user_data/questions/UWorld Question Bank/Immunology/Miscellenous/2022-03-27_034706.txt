Educational Objective:

NK cells recognize and kill cells with decreased MHC class | antigen cell surface expression,
such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells. They are large lymphocytes that contain perforins
and granzymes in cytoplasmic granules. NK cells kill target cells by inducing apoptosis.
