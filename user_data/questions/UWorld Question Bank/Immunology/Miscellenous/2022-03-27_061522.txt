to form, recently exposed patients often have neaanve initial TST testing. Conversion usually
occurs within 8 weeks.

Most patients with primary tuberculosis have no symptoms and no chest x-ray findings;
however, after several months, a Ranke complex (calcified lower lobe nodule and ipsilateral
hilar lymph node) can often be seen on x-ray.

(Choice A) Facultative, intracellular organisms such as M tuberculosis are protected from
antibodies and complement when within cells. As a result, elimination of these pathogens
does not primarily rely on the humoral immune system (eg, B lymphocytes).

(Choice C) Neutrophils are the crucial immune component for initial control of most
extracellular bacterial infections (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Macrophages are the
critical immune effector cell in patients with M tuberculosis and most other intracellular
infections (in combination with T lymphocytes).

(Choice D) Intracellular organisms that replicate in the cytosol, such as viruses or certain
intracellular bacteria (eg, Listeria), are processed by the proteasome and displayed on major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | molecules. This leads to the activation of CD8 T
lymphocytes. M tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome (not the cytosol),
leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on MHC class II molecules and the subsequent
