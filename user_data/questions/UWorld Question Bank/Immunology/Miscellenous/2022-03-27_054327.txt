(Choice A) Bradykinin is a vasoactive inflammatory mediator that is normally produced by
endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets during the inflammatory phase of wound
healing. Further upregulation of inflammatory mediators in patients with diabetes would most
likely have a negative effect on fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization.

(Choice B) Although a baseline level of cortisol production is required for normal wound
healing, excess cortisol can impair both the inflammatory and proliferative components of
wound healing. Patients with diabetes tend to have elevated cortisol levels; therefore, further
cortisol elevation would not improve wound healing.

(Choice C) Excess glucose inhibits fibroblast migration and results in the nonenzymatic
glycation of collagen fibers, which can prevent collagen cross-linking and can impair the
structural integrity of a healing wound.

Educational objective:

Elevated blood glucose induces the release of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory
cytokines from neutrophils while inhibiting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg,
IL-10) and growth factors needed for fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization in a healing
wound. As a result, patients with uncontrolled diabetes frequently have nonhealing wounds

with evidence of ongoing inflammation. ctivate V
