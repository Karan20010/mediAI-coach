This patient developed a morbilliform (ie, measles-like) rash 1-2 weeks following

carbamazepine initiation, concerning for morbilliform drug eruption, a type of drug-induced

exanthem.

Morbilliform drug eruption is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction caused by
drugs or their metabolites. It typically manifests 5-21 days following drug initiation, or within 1-
3 days after reexposure in previously sensitized patients. Lesions consist of erythematous
papules and macules distributed symmetrically on the trunk and extremities, sometimes
accompanied by low-grade fever, pruritis, and eosinophilia. Unlike Stevens-Johnson
syndrome, mucosal involvement (eg, conjunctivae, oropharynx) and skin tenderness are
absent.

Common culprit drugs include anticonvulsants (eg, carbamazepine, phenytoin), antibiotics
(eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and antiretroviral therapy. Treatment involves cessation
of the offending drug; the rash typically self-resolves within 1-3 weeks.
