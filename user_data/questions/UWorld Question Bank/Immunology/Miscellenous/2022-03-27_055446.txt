A 34-year-old woman with end-stage kidney disease secondary to IgA nephropathy is
undergoing kidney transplant from an unrelated living donor. The patient receives induction
immunosuppression with a rabbit antithymocyte globulin—based regimen immediately prior to
the procedure. The surgery is performed without complications, and maintenance
immunosuppressive therapy is begun. Ten days later, the patient experiences high fevers,
generalized pruritic rash, and pain, redness, and swelling of the bilateral metacarpophalangeal
joints, wrists, and knees. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is elevated. Arthrocentesis of the
involved joint yields synovial fluid with neutrophilic leukocytosis; there are no crystals and no
bacteria on Gram stain. Which of the following is most likely responsible for the increased
synovial membrane permeability in this patient?

A. C3b (15%)
SY B. Cda (63%)
C. IL-5 (10%)
D. N-formylated peptides (6%)
E. RANTES (4%)
