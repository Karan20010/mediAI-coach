Immunoglobulins are composed of a pair of heavy and light chains. Light chains have a
variable and constant region; heavy chains have a variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions
(CH1-4) depending on the immunoglobulin type.

Immunoglobulins are generally further divided into 2 functional pieces as follows:

¢ The Fab fragment is composed of the entire light-chain and the heavy-chain variable and
first constant region. This portion of the immunoglobulin uses the variable region of the
light and heavy chain to bind specific antigenic epitopes. IgM has 10 Fab fragments;
other immunoglobulins have 2

¢ The Fe fragment is composed of the remaining constant regions (eg, CH2-4) of the heavy
chain. The Fc fragment exerts the effector functions of the molecule, which may include
activating the classical complement cascade (eg, CH2 on IgG) or binding the Fc receptor
on phagocytic cells (eg, CH4 on IgM, CH3 on IgG)

IgG, IgA, and IgD also have a hinge region between the Fab and the Fc fragments. The
hinge region is rich in cysteine and proline amino acids, which provide significant flexibility to
the immunoglobulin and allow greater movement of the Fab fragment arms. Fab fragments
with long hinge regions are better able to reach multiple epitopes on an antigen; this
