lymphocytes. M tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome (not the cytosol),
leading to display of mycobacterial antigens on MHC class II molecules and the subsequent
activation of CD4, rather than CD8, cells.

(Choice E) Natural killer cells are cytotoxic lymphocytes that can recognize damaged or
infected cells without MHC activation. They are important for clearing viral infections and for
tumor immunosurveillance, but are not the primary effector cell in tuberculosis infection.

Educational objective:

Mycobacteria tuberculosis primarily replicates within the phagosome, leading to display of
mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex class Il molecules. This results in
the activation of CD4 cells and subsequent control of the infection with macrophages.
