with long hinge regions are better able to reach multiple epitopes on an antigen; this

increases immunoglobulin avidity because avidity is directly proportional to the number of

Fab-antigen interactions. However, long hinge regions are more susceptible to destruction by

bacterial proteases (eg, IgA protease).

(Choice A) Affinity is the binding strength of the Fab variable region for a given antigenic
epitope. Affinity is determined by the hypervariable amino acid sequence of the variable
region; the hinge region does not play a role.

(Choice B) IgM is a pentamer and IgA is usually dimeric. These multimers form due to
disulfide bonds between the Fc chains of the molecule and an additional amino acid sequence
called the J chain. Polymerization is not affected by the hinge region.

(Choices D and E) The Fc portions of different immunoglobulins interact with different
receptors on immune cells. IgE interacts with the Fc epsilon receptor on mast cells, IgG
interacts with the Fc gamma receptor on phagocytes and natural killer cells, and IgA interacts
with the Fc alpha receptor on neutrophils, macrophages, and eosinophils. The specificity of
these interactions is mediated by the heavy-chain constant regions in the Fc portion of the
immunoglobulins, not the hinge region.
