(Choice C) Patchy necrosis with granulation tissue is indicative of ischemic damage to the
donor heart. Ischemia in a donor heart can occur in a variety of situations including during
attempted resuscitation of the donor patient, during transport of the organ from the donor to
the recipient, and acutely during initial perfusion of the organ after transplantation.

(Choice D) Perivascular infiltrate with abundant eosinophils is a histopathologic feature of
hypersensitivity myocarditis. Hypersensitivity myocarditis often represents an immunologic
response to a newly initiated drug.

(Choice E) Interstitial fibrosis with scant inflammation can be seen in chronic rejection of solid
organ transplants. Chronic rejection is mediated by host T-lymphocytes as well as antibodies
and classically occurs months to years following transplantation.

Educational objective:

Acute cardiac transplant rejection usually occurs weeks to months following transplantation
and is primarily a cell-mediated process. In acute cellular rejection, endomyocardial biopsy
shows an interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate with myocyte damage.
