Growth restriction, microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, and a diffuse dark-blue rash (ie,

14 blueberry muffin rash) are nonspecific features shared by multiple congenital (TORCH)
infections (eg, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella). These infections are transmitted
17 transplacentally to the fetus from a mother infected during pregnancy. Although maternal
symptoms may be mild (eg, fever, lymphadenopathy), the developing fetus can have

+ 20 significant morbidity, particularly with a first trimester infection.

+ 2 Serology and polymerase chain reaction testing can help to determine the diagnosis in a
neonate with suspected intrauterine infection. Neonatal antibody titers can be difficult to
25 interpret, particularly due to maternal transfer of some antibodies and not others:

27 ¢ Maternal IgM does not cross the placenta, so detection of organism-specific IgM in a
symptomatic neonate is diagnostic.

e At birth, virtually all infant IgG is maternally derived IgG that crossed the placenta, and

: 32 elevated maternal IgG would be expected in this mother with infectious symptoms 6-7
= months prior to delivery (Choices A and D). Therefore, organism-specific newborn IgG
35 (eg, Toxoplasma |gG) will also be elevated in the setting of a past maternal infection.

37 (Choice C) Maternal IgM may be negative with a remote infection (as with this mother) or
