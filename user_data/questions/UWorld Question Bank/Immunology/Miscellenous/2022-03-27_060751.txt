factors that allow them to escape the phagosome and replicate within the cytosol. These
pathogens are primarily processed by the proteasome (rather than the lysosome), leading to
the display of bacterial protein fragments on MHC class | molecules. MHC class | molecules
stimulate cytotoxic T cells (CD8 lymphocytes). In contrast, phagocytosed bacteria that remain
within the phagosome (eg, M tuberculosis) are broken down by the lysosome and displayed on
MHC class || molecules, which activate CD4, not CD8, cells.

(Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus attacks B lymphocytes and leads to long-term, latent infection
that is typically asymptomatic but can occasionally lead to B-lymphocyte malignant
transformation. Although malignant transformation can cause large, atypical cells, acid-fast
bacilli would not be seen on culture.

(Choice C) Fibroblast proliferation and collagen production contribute to caseating granuloma
formation but do not cause macrophage activation, which is necessary for the formation of
multinucleated Langhans giant cells.

(Choice D) Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells) have multilobed nuclei that would be visible
at this magnification. Neutrophils play a major role in early inflammation and elimination of
extracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Staphylococcus aureus). However, they are not the
primary effector cell in the elimination of facultative intracellular pathogens such as M
