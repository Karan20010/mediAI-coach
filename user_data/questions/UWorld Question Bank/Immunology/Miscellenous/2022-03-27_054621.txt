including otitis media, pneumonia, and erysipelas. Although his infections have been
responsive to treatment, his father is concerned about the number of infections. The patient
also has persistent diarrhea, and a recent stool antigen detection assay was positive for
Giardia lamblia. An immunoglobulin panel demonstrates very low serum levels of all
immunoglobulin types. Intradermal injection of Candida antigens results in a large indurated
nodule within 48 hours. This patient's lymph nodes most likely lack which of the following
structures?
