A 48-year-old woman is evaluated for a painless left breast mass. Physical examination
shows a 4-cm mass with dimpling of the overlying skin; left axillary lymphadenopathy also is
noted. Breast imaging reveals a spiculated soft tissue mass with microcalcifications. Biopsy
of the mass demonstrates invasive ductal carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry of the tissue
sample shows the tumor cells are negative for estrogen and progesterone receptors but
overexpress the HER2 epidermal growth factor receptor. The patient is treated with systemic
chemotherapy and a monoclonal antibody drug that binds the extracellular domain of the
growth factor receptor. Repeat evaluation 6 weeks later shows a decrease in the size of the
breast mass. Which of the following host factors are primarily responsible for mediating the
response to the monoclonal antibody therapy?

A. B lymphocytes and IgM (13%)
B. CD8- T lymphocytes and interferon gamma (38%)

SY C. Natural killer cells and granzymes (38%)

D. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lysosomes (9%)
