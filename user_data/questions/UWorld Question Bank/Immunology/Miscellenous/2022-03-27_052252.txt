cancer cells) activities depending on the local cytokine milieu. However, PD-1 inhibitors do not
increase the antitumor activity of neutrophils or macrophages.

(Choice B) Tumor cells often induce desmoplasia, which refers to excessive connective
tissue/stroma growth around the tumor. A strong desmoplastic response can reduce the ability
of chemotherapeutic agents to penetrate into the tumor, leading to chemoresistance.

(Choice C) Angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) are used to prevent neovascularization
of growing tumors, leading to ischemia and tumor necrosis. PD-1 inhibitors cause cytotoxic T-
cell activation, leading to increased apoptosis of tumor cells; they do not induce ischemic

necrosis.

Educational objective:

Programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) is a checkpoint inhibitor that downregulates the cytotoxic
T-cell response. Neoplastic cells often exploit this receptor via the overexpression of PD-1
ligand. PD-1 receptor inhibitors (eg, Pembrolizumab) restore the T-cell response, allowing
cytotoxic T cells to invade the tumor and induce apoptosis of neoplastic cells.
