Leukocyte surface molecules are categorized using cluster of differentiation (CD)
nomenclature to assist with immunophenotyping, the differentiation of immune cells based
on cell surface features (ie, with flow cytometry). Although some CD molecules are expressed
on most immune cells (eg, CD45), others are restricted to a specific population of leukocytes.

CD19 is a transmembrane protein unique to B lymphocytes that reduces the cytokine
threshold for B-cell activation and proliferation following antigen binding. Because B-cell
cancers (eg, acute lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse B-cell lymphoma) often overexpress CD19 to
increase replication rate, anti-CD19 immunotherapy has been developed to treat these
malignancies.

CAR T-cell therapy is a specific type of immunotherapy that involves the following:
1. Extraction and purification of T cells from a patient or donor

2. Genetic modification to form a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), which combines an
extracellular antigen recognition domain for an antigen overexpressed in a tumor with an
intracellular stimulatory T-cell signaling domain that promotes T-cell activation/proliferation
and tumor-killing activity.

3. Reinfusion of the modified T cells into the patient
