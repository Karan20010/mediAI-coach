The balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the intestinal mucosa is essential for
homeostasis. Overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines leads to pathology such as that
observed in inflammatory bowel diseases. Among the listed choices, IL-10 is the only cytokine
with anti-inflammatory properties. IL-10 reduces production of proinflammatory T,,1 cytokines
(IL-2 and interferon gamma) and major histocompatibility complex class II expression
(important for antigen presentation and T-helper cell response). It also inhibits activated
dendritic cells and macrophages. These effects of IL-10 result in the attenuation of cellular-
mediated immunity with some enhancement of the humoral response, leading to a protective
effect in Crohn disease.

(Choice A) IL-1, produced by macrophages and epithelial cells, has proinflammatory
properties such as endothelium activation, increased chemokine expression (promoting
leukocyte recruitment), and induction of fever. IL-18 is important for differentiation of T.,17
cells.

(Choice B) IL-5 is secreted by T,2 cells and promotes the humoral response by stimulating
differentiation of B cells and increasing IgA production. It also promotes the growth and
differentiation of eosinophils and is implicated in the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases
(eg, asthma). ctivate V
