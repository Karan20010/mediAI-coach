immature, nucleated erythrocytes and leads to persistent extramedullary hematopoiesis in the
liver, spleen, and other tissues (hepatosplenomegaly).

(Choice A) Sickle cell anemia causes vasoocclusion due to abnormal hemoglobin
polymerization. It is asymptomatic in the fetus/neonate due to high levels of fetal hemoglobin
that are not replaced by hemoglobin S until age 3-12 months.

(Choice B) Fetuses with homozygous alpha-thalassemia (hemoglobin Barts) have no alpha
globin chains and therefore form gamma-4 tetramers with very high oxygen affinity. The
consequence is severe functional anemia and tissue hypoxia, which results in high-output
heart failure and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (negative Coombs test).

(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency can cause prolonged neonatal
jaundice (beyond 2 weeks) due to increased erythrocyte breakdown and immaturity of the
newborn liver. However, the associated anemia is rarely severe.

(Choice E) Infants are born with an immature immune system; their humoral defense during
the first 6 months of life comes primarily from maternal circulating IgG that is received
transplacentally prior to birth and from mucosal IgA received via breastfeeding. Therefore,
fetal antibody-mediated red blood cell lysis is an unlikely etiology.
