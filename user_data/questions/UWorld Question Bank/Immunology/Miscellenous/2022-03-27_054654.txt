(Choice C) The paracortical zone lies internal to the cortex of the lymph node. This zone is
populated primarily by T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Dendritic cells present antigens
collected from the blood and lymph to the T lymphocytes aggregated in this section of the
node. This patient's positive reaction to Candida antigens (type 4 hypersensitivity) indicates
intact T lymphocyte function.

(Choices D and E) The subcapsular sinuses are found between the capsule and the cortex of
the lymph node and are in direct communication with afferent lymphatic vessels. These
sinuses are connected to cortical sinuses that line the trabeculae and penetrate through the
cortex and paracortex to reach the medulla. From there, medullary sinuses drain into the
efferent lymphatic channel. These structures are not affected in XLA.

Educational objective:

X-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia is caused by a defect in B cell maturation, resulting in
absent mature B cells and severely low immunoglobulin levels. T cell numbers and function
remain intact. Due to the absence of B cells, primary lymphoid follicles and germinal centers
do not form within lymph nodes.
