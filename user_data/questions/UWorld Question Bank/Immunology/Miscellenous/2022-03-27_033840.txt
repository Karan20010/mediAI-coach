(Choice C) Certolizumab pegol (Certo-li-zu-mab) is a pegylated (pegol) humanized
monoclonal antibody that targets TNF-a. It lacks the Fc region, which helps minimizes
complement activation and cell-mediated cytotoxicity that can occur with other anti-TNF-a
medications that contain Fc domains.

(Choice D) Imatinib (Imati-nib) mesylate is used to treat specific cancers, including
Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia and kit-positive
gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It is an example of a small-molecule tyrosine kinase receptor
inhibitor.

Educational objective:

The suffix of a biological agent indicates whether a medication is a monoclonal antibody
(mab), a receptor molecule (cept), or a kinase inhibitor (nib). Monoclonal antibodies also
include in their names the type of target (eg, bacterial or immune system) and their origin (eg,
human or mouse).
