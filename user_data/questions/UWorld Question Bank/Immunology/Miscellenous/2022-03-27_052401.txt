Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a cytokine produced end

lymphocyte activity, as follows:

¢ CD4 cells: IL-2 converts activated CD4 ce

response.

¢ CD8 cells: IL-2 expands the pool of activa
killing with granzymes and perforins.

ogenously by activated CD4 cells, CD8 cells,

and natural killer (NK) cells. High-dose IL-2 infusions can also be administered to patients with
advanced renal cell carcinoma or metastatic melanoma in order to increase antitumor

ls into type 1 T-helper cells, which then secrete

inflammatory cytokines (eg, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2) that drive an antitumor

ffect of IL-2 therapy comes from increased NK

Although patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma who undergo IL-2 therapy may enter

it is nonspecific and causes significant adverse

effects due to excessive cytokine production (eg, capillary leak syndrome). Therefore, most
patients are now treated with newer immunotherapy agents such as CTLA-4 inhibitors (eg,
