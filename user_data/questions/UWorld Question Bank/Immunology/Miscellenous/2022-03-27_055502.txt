C3a and C5a are potent chemoattractants that dramatically increase phagocyte recruitment
(eg, neutrophils, macrophages) to areas of IC deposition due to effects on the vasculature (eg,
vasodilation, increased permeability) and immune cells (eg, increased adhesion molecule
expression). This leads to development of local (eg, skin rash, joint pain/effusion, neutrophilic
joint effusion) and systemic (eg, high fever, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate)
inflammatory manifestations that resolve spontaneously over a few days as the ICs are
processed/removed by phagocytes.

(Choice C) IL-5 is a cytokine produced by activated CD4 cells and mast cells. It stimulates B
cells to proliferate and generate IgA. It does not play a significant role in neutrophil recruitment
to areas of IC deposition.

(Choice D) N-formylated peptides are chemoattractants released by damaged host cells and
pathogens. Although they recruit neutrophils to areas of active infection, they are not the
primary driver in serum sickness; in serum sickness, most of the inflammatory response is
mediated by C3a and C5a.

(Choice E) RANTES is a chemokine that recruits T cells, eosinophils, and basophils to areas
of inflammation. It is not a strong neutrophil chemoattractant and is not a significant by-

product of the classical complement cascade activation.
