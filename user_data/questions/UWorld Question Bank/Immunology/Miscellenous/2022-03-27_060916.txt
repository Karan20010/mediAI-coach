This patient has cough, fever, weight loss, and an upper lobe lesion on chest x-ray, raising
strong suspicion for active pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis cannot be
visualized on Gram stain due to the high lipid content (mycolic acid) of its cell wall. Most cases
are diagnosed by acid-fast sputum testing and culture, but tissue microscopy typically shows
granulomas characterized by epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated Langhans giant
cells.

Granulomas often form after tissue macrophages encounter pathogens or substances that
cannot be easily digested or removed. M tuberculosis can evade intracellular killing by
macrophages and reproduce within phagolysosomes. Infected macrophages present
mycobacterial antigens to naive CD4 helper T cells in pulmonary lymph nodes and secrete IL-
12, which induces activated T helper cells to differentiate into T helper subtype 1 (Th1) cells.

Proliferating Th1 cells migrate to sites of infection, where they release interferon-gamma,
which activates macrophages, improves intracellular killing of ingested mycobacteria, and
recruits additional macrophages by increasing production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
Activated macrophages can also limit the spread of mycobacteria by differentiating into
epithelioid and giant cells that surround residual foci of mycobacteria, trapping them inside the
necrotic, cheese-like area of a caseating granuloma.
