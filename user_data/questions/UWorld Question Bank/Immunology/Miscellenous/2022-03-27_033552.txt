hapten-sensitized T cells in the dermis and epidermis. This results in an inflammatory
response and the clinical manifestations of contact dermatitis.

Depending on the etiologic agent, contact dermatitis can be mediated primarily by cytotoxic
CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T,1 cells (that cause indirect damage by activating macrophages). In
urushiol-induced contact dermatitis, CD8+ T cells are the primary effector cells and directly
destroy keratinocytes expressing haptenated proteins.

(Choices A and C) Mast cells and basophils, along with IgE, are primarily responsible for type
| hypersensitivity allergic reactions. Mast cells play a role in modulating the response in
contact dermatitis by affecting antigen presentation and T-cell recruitment and activation, but
they are not the main effector cells in type IV hypersensitivity.

(Choice B) Eosinophils are cells that play a role in the defense against parasitic organisms
and allergic reactions.

(Choice D) Neutrophils are the primary phagocytic killers of the innate immune system and do
not play a significant role in type IV hypersensitivity reactions. They are more important in type
Ill hypersensitivity reactions, in which deposited immune complexes activate complement and
cause neutrophil-mediated tissue damage.
