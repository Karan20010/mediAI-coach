Explanation

This patient's flow cytometry shows normal numbers of CD3- cells (reflecting circulating T
cells) and CD19- cells (reflecting circulating B cells). However, an absence of HLA-DR: cells
indicates defective expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules.
it The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes encode MHC molecules expressed on the cell
surface for antigen presentation. There are 6 major HLA loci:

e¢ HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, and HLA-DR genes encode MHC class II molecules, which are
16 expressed on antigen-presenting cells (eg, B cells, macrophages) after an extracellular
antigen has been loaded onto the MHC class || molecule in an acidified lysosome.

¢ HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes encode MHC class | molecules, which are expressed on
nucleated cells after a cytosolic antigen has been transported into the endoplasmic
reticulum and loaded onto the MHC class | molecule (Choice E).

Because expression of the MHC class I|-peptide complex is necessary for activation of B and
T cells, its absence (eg, bare lymphocyte syndrome type II) causes a form of severe combined

immunodeficiency.
