This patient received rabbit antithymocyte globulin and subsequently developed
manifestations (eg, high fever, pruritic rash, joint pain/swelling) of serum sickness, an
immune complex—mediated, type IIl hypersensitivity reaction that occurs 7-10 days after
exposure to foreign protein in medication or vaccination. The underlying pathophysiology is
as follows:

¢ Foreign proteins from the medication are processed by antigen-presenting cells and
displayed on major histocompatibility complex class I] molecules (MHCIl).

¢ Patrolling CD4 cells bind the antigen-MHCIl, undergo activation, and stimulate B cells to
form plasma cells that secrete high-affinity IgG.

¢ The IgG binds the foreign proteins in the medication, thereby generating immune
complexes (ICs).

When large quantities of ICs are rapidly formed, they aggregate and deposit in the skin and
joints. Deposited ICs activate the classical complement cascade. Although this generates
the opsonizing protein C3b, which allows the IC to be cleared by phagocytic cells using the
C3b receptor (Choice A), it also generates the highly inflammatory anaphylatoxins C3a and
CSa.
