iB ¢ Increased secretion of immunoinhibitory cytokines: Tumors increase production of
= cytokines (eg, IL-10, tumor growth factor beta) that dampen the immune response (Choice
15 A).
16
7 ¢ Selection of tumor cells with minimal immunogenicity: Cells most visible to the immune
. system are quickly destroyed; this generates a selective pressure on the tumor cell
+ 20 population that promotes proliferation of the least immunologically visible cancer cells.
21
+ 2 (Choice B) Tumor cells often increase (not decrease) expression of reactive oxygen and

nitrogen species, which exert a negative effect on T-cell function in the tumor

28 microenvironment.
26
27 (Choice D) Dendritic cell activation is primarily mediated by CD40-ligand (CD40-L), a surface
. * molecule present on activated T-helper cells. Because PD-L1—PD-1 binding reduces the
+ 30 effector T-cell population, there is less CD40-L to activate antigen-presenting cells.

+32 Educational objective:
= Tumor cells must develop adaptations to avoid destruction by the innate and adaptive immune

35 response. A common adaptation is to overexpress programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1),
which converts effector T cells to exhausted T cells. Other adaptations include down-
