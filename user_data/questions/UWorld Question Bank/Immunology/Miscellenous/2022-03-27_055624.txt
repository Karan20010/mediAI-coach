This patient with atopic dermatitis is predisposed to secondary skin infections (eg, impetigo,
cellulitis). His antecedent skin infection, along with nephritic syndrome, suggests
poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN), the most common form of acute nephritis in
children.

During infection, antibodies form against antigens expressed by nephritogenic strains of group
A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (eg, S pyogenes). These antistreptococcal antibodies
combine with streptococcal antigens to form immune complexes that are deposited along the
glomerular basement membrane (type Ill hypersensitivity). These deposits can then be
visualized as electron-dense subepithelial "humps" on electron microscopy and as granular
depositions within the mesangium and glomerular capillary walls on IgG and C3
immunofluorescence.

(Choices A and E) Cytotoxic CD8- T lymphocytes and macrophages play a prominent role in
type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reactions. These cells are stimulated by T helper cells,
leading to localized inflammation, cellular destruction, and granuloma formation. Type IV
hypersensitivity is responsible for contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy) and positive tuberculin
skin test reactions.
