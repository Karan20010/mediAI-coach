Neoplastic cells produce proteins not found in healthy cells. Pieces of these proteins
(neoantigens) are displayed on MHC class | molecules on the cell surface and are
subsequently recognized by cytotoxic T cells as "nonself" (leading to cellular apoptosis).
However, neoplastic cells generally accumulate genetic mutations that allow them to thwart the
cytotoxic T-cell response and evade detection/destruction. One common mechanism is the
overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the cancer cell surface; this ligand
binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and suppresses their ability to induce apoptosis
(T-cell exhaustion).

Treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1 such as pembrolizumab have shown
promise in cancers that overexpress PD-L1 (eg, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma). Blockade
of PD-1 restores the cytotoxic T-cell response (disinhibition), which promotes tumor cell
apoptosis. Patients with advanced melanoma and other susceptible malignancies often have
a drastic clinical response (eg, tumor regression, long-term remission) to PD-1 antagonists.

(Choices A and E) Cancer-related inflammation also involves cells of the innate immune
system such as macrophages and neutrophils. These cells can have either protumor (eg,
release of matrix metalloproteases that facilitate invasion) and antitumor (eg, direct killing of

cancer cells) activities depending on the local cytokine milieu. However, PD-1 inhibitors do not
