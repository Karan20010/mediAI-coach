(Choice E) Neutrophils primarily phagocytize and destroy bacterial and fungal pathogens.
They do not play a significant role in fighting viral infections, and a and B interferon release by
virally infected cells does not promote neutrophil recruitment.

Educational objective:

Interferons a and B are produced by most human cells in response to viral infections. The
production of a and 8 interferons helps suppress viral replication by halting protein synthesis
and promoting apoptosis of infected cells, limiting the ability of viruses to spread through the
tissues.
