This inflammatory response is rapid (ie, minutes), unlike this patient's delayed (48-hr)
response.

(Choice B) Bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris are caused by autoantibodies
against hemidesmosomes and desmosomes on keratinocytes, respectively. This causes
epidermal/dermal separation and acantholysis, respectively, manifesting as bullae. These
conditions are not hypersensitive reactions and cannot be elicited by patch testing.

(Choice C) Immune complex deposition in small cutaneous vessels causes cutaneous small
vessel vasculitis (CSVV). Medications that function as haptens (eg, phenytoin, sulfonamides)
can cause the condition. Because of the extravasation of red blood cells due to vessel wall
inflammation, CSVV presents with nonblanchable purpura and petechiae, not vesicles.

Educational objective:

Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Initially, Langerhans
cells travel to regional lymph nodes and present haptens to naive T cells, leading to clonal
expansion. On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells cause tissue destruction that
manifests as pruritic erythema, vesicles, and/or bullae 2-3 days after exposure.
