(Choice C) Chronic granulomatous disease is characterized by impaired destruction of
phagocytized organisms in neutrophils due to a mutation (usually X linked) that causes
decreased production of NADPH oxidase. The lack of superoxide production needed for the
oxidative burst in neutrophils results in recurrent, severe bacterial and fungal infections in an
infant or toddler.

(Choice D) MHC class II molecules are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (eg,
macrophages, B cells) after phagocytized proteins are degraded within lysosomes and added
to MHC class II molecules. T helper (CD4-) cells are activated by the MHC class II-peptide
complex and coordinate the adaptive immune response. TAP does not play a role in antigen
loading of MHC class II molecules.

(Choice E) Migration and extravasation of neutrophils is impaired in leukocyte adhesion
deficiency due to a mutation in integrins necessary for the adhesion of immune cells to blood
vessel walls. Without this adhesion, neutrophils are unable to leave blood vessels to follow
chemotactic signals, resulting in delayed separation of the umbilical cord, recurrent bacterial
infections, neutrophilia, and absent pus formation.
