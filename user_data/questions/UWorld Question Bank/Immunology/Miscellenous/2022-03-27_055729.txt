(eg, asthma).

(Choice D) IL-12 is secreted by macrophages and induces differentiation of T,,1 cells and

activation of natural killer cells.

(Choice E) Interferon gamma is secreted by T,,1 cells and promotes proinflammatory

pathways by activating macrophages, increasing antigen presentation, and inducing the death
of epithelial cells.

(Choice F) Tumor necrosis factor—alpha, produced by macrophages, natural killer cells, and T
cells, is a proinflammatory mediator that promotes leukocyte recruitment and activates the
endothelium (increases expression of adhesion molecules).

Educational objective:

Of the cytokines released in the setting of tissue injury, IL-10 plays important anti-inflammatory
and immunomodulatory roles, especially in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.
IL-10 attenuates the immune response through the inhibition of T,,1 cytokines, reduction of
major histocompatibility complex class II expression, and suppression of activated
macrophages and dendritic cells.
