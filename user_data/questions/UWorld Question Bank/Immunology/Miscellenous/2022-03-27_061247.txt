This patient with Crohn disease initially responded to treatment with adalimumab but
subsequently experienced treatment failure with a relapse of symptoms after nearly a year of
therapy. Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG that binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha
(TNF-alpha), an inflammatory cytokine involved in promoting leukocyte migration, neutrophil
and macrophage function, and granuloma integrity. Adalimumab prevents TNF-alpha from
associating with its cell-surface receptors, blocking its pro-inflammatory effects. TNF-alpha
inhibitors are used for a variety of inflammatory disorders such as Crohn disease, psoriasis,
and rheumatoid arthritis.

However, use of adalimumab can induce the formation of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), which
reduce the activity of the agent and lead to more rapid drug clearance and lower trough levels
between doses. Patients with ADAs against adalimumab typically experience declining
effectiveness of treatment and can develop hypersensitivity reactions after administration.
The formation of ADAs can also be seen with other immunoglobulin-based anti-TNF agents
(eg, infliximab) but is uncommon with etanercept, a recombinant TNF-receptor fusion protein.

(Choice B) Glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that forms insoluble complexes. This
leads to the formation of microprecipitates at the injection site that then slowly dissolve and are
released into the circulation throughout the day. Adalimumab is given as a subcutaneous
