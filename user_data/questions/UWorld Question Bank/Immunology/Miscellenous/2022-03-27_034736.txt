Antigens are presented to cytotoxic CD8- T-lymphocytes in association with MHC class |
molecules. MHC class | is present on the surface of all nucleated cells. Each molecule of
MHC class | protein consists of a single heavy chain and an associated B,-microglobulin.
Heavy chains are highly polymorphic, allowing them to present a large variety of antigens.
After penetrating a cell, the virus uncoats and releases its core proteins. Some viral
polypeptides are processed in the host cell cytoplasm and combined with MHC class | in the
endoplasmic reticulum. The foreign antigen is then presented in association with MHC class |
protein on the surface of the infected cell, signaling to CD8- lymphocytes that the cell needs to

be destroyed. The infected cell is ultimately eliminated via apoptosis.

Important features of MHC class | and II molecules are compared below:
