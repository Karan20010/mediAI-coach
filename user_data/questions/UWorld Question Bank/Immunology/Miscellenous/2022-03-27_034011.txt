A research scientist is comparing surface antigens X and Y that come from 2 different viruses.

He obtains antibodies against antigen X from an animal previously exposed to the virus

expressing this antigen. These antibodies are then attached to assay plates. Next, a fixed

quantity of radiolabeled X antigen is added to the plates. Unlabeled Y antigens are then

added in increasing concentrations to each plate, and the plates are washed to remove

unbound antigens. Radioactivity is plotted as a function of Y antigen concentration, as shown

in the graph below.
