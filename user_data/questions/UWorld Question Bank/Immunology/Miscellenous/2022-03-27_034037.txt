A radioimmunoassay is a laboratory technique that uses specific antibodies and a known
quantity of radiolabeled antigen to determine the amount of antigen present in an unknown
sample. In this technique, specific antibodies against a known antigen are attached to an

assay plate. Next, a fixed quantity of radiolabeled antigen and varying quantities of

unlabeled antigen are added to the plate. The system is subsequently washed to remove

unbound antigens, and radioactivity is measured.

The researcher in the above experiment observes no change in radioactivity with increasing Y
antigen concentrations. This indicates that antigen Y cannot bind the available antibodies and
therefore shares no epitopes with antigen X.

(Choice B) If the radiolabeled and unlabeled antigens are identical (eg, have the same
epitopes), they should compete equally for antibody binding sites. The amount of radiolabeled
antigen displaced from the antibodies will be proportionate to the amount of unlabeled antigen
added. Consequently, increasing concentrations of antigen Y would result in a proportionate
decrease in measured radioactivity.

(Choices C and D) If antigen Y shared most or some of the epitopes of antigen X, then
antigen Y would bind at a rate proportionate to both the amount of antibodies able to recognize

the common epitopes and the amount of antigen Y added to the system.
