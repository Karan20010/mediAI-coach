Tuberculin skin testing (TST) introduces purified proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis
into the dermis. Because M tuberculosis is primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune
response (CMIR), previously infected patients have primed, antigen-specific CD4 T
lymphocytes that rapidly replicate and mature in response to tuberculin antigen re-exposure.

T-lymphocyte activation is a 2-step process:

¢ T lymphocytes with specific T cell receptors recognize antigens presented on class II
major histocompatibility complexes on the surface of dendritic cells (eg, antigen-presenting
cells [APCs])

¢ Acostimulatory interaction between CD28 on the T lymphocyte and CD80/86 on the
dendritic cell then allows for activation

Activated CD4 T lymphocytes release inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6, TNF alpha) that
stimulate/recruit other immune cells and increase vascular permeability, forming an indurated
wheal of inflammation following TST exposure. Tuberculin reactions appear 24-72 hours after
antigen exposure due to delays between initial antigen processing by APCs, T-cell activation,

and amplification of the cellular response.

(Choice A) CD14 is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptor on macrophages that
