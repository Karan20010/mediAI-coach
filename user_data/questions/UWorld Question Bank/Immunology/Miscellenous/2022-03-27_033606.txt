A scientist is interested in the mechanisms by which leukocytes traffic to sites of inflammation
and infection. She finds that endothelial cells increase the expression of certain cell surface
molecules in response to cytokines to allow for leukocyte trafficking. She subsequently
creates a knockout mouse that has a deletion in the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule
1 (PECAM-1) gene. The protein product of this gene is mainly localized to specific areas on

the endothelial cells. Absent expression of this gene will most likely affect which of the
following neutrophil functions?

© A. Crawling

©) B. Margination
© C. Rolling

©) D. Tight adhesion

©) E. Transmigration
