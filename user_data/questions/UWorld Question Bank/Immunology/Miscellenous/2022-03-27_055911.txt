and washed during the blood-separation process.

(Choice C) An acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is caused by ABO incompatibility (eg, due
to clerical error). Patients naturally have preformed antibodies against foreign ABO antigens
(eg, anti-B antibodies in a type A patient) that will attack antigens on mismatched donor RBCs
(eg, type B donor blood). Massive hemolysis occurs within minutes to hours of transfusion,
causing fever, flank pain, and hemoglobinuria.

(Choice D) Anaphylactic transfusion reactions occur within minutes of transfusion initiation
and present with wheezing, angioedema, and hypotension, findings not seen in this patient.
This reaction can occur in patients with IgA deficiency due to the reaction of recipient anti-IgA
antibodies against donor IgA.

Educational objective:

Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions are usually mild, hemolytic reactions that occur >24
hours after blood transfusion. They are a type of anamnestic response (delayed immunologic
response) that occurs in patients previously exposed to a minor RBC antigen (eg, previous
blood transfusion, pregnancy).
