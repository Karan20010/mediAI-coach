This patient's recurrent infections in the setting of intact T lymphocyte function (positive
response to Candida antigens) and very low immunoglobulin levels suggest X-linked (Bruton)
agammaglobulinemia (XLA). This condition results from a mutation in the Bruton tyrosine
kinase gene that causes failure of bone marrow pre-B cells to develop into mature B
lymphocytes. As a result, patients have absent or very low B lymphocytes in the peripheral
blood and lymphoid tissues.

In general, B lymphocytes aggregate in the cortex of lymph nodes to form lymphoid follicles.
Primary follicles are dense and dormant; secondary follicles have a pale germinal center
containing proliferating B cells in response to an antigenic stimulus. In XLA, primary lymphoid
follicles and germinal centers do not form due to an absence of B cells.

Lack of mature B lymphocytes also leads to inability to produce plasma cells, and patients
therefore have absent or very low serum immunoglobulins. Recurrent infections typically
begin once maternally derived antibodies wane (age 3-6 months), as seen here.

(Choice B) The outer cortex is composed of primary and secondary lymphoid follicles (ie, B
cell-rich regions), but it also contains prominent numbers of CD4+ T cells within the
interfollicular regions (allowing for T-B cell interaction). In patients with XLA, the outer cortex is

present but diminished.
