barrier (eg, trauma, meningitis), leading to excessive leakage of plasma proteins.

(Choices C, D, and E) Serum IgA (mainly monomeric), IgG, and IgM increase with both forms
of the polio vaccine and are protective against viral dissemination. Serum IgG and IgM can
also be secreted by the mucosa although to a lesser extent than secretory IgA (explaining why
most patients with selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic).

Educational objective:

The live attenuated oral (Sabin) poliovirus vaccine produces a stronger mucosal secretory IgA
immune response than does the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine. This increase in
mucosal IgA offers immune protection at the site of viral entry by inhibiting attachment to
intestinal epithelial cells.
