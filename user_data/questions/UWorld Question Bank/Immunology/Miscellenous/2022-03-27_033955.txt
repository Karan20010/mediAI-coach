Fas or FasL impair this process, resulting in excessive accumulation of autoreactive T-cells
and the development of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (which
this patient appears to have).

(Choice B) As B lymphocytes undergo affinity maturation, cells that exhibit a stronger affinity
for the antigen (which acts as a limited growth resource) are able to proliferate more than cells
with lower affinity. This results in cells that are more efficient and accurate in binding to
pathogens. Affinity maturation does not involve the Fas pathway.

(Choice C) Anergy is a state of prolonged unresponsiveness that occurs in T lymphocytes as
a form of immune tolerance. It occurs when self-reactive T cells bind MHC molecules without
receiving the necessary costimulatory signal (ie, binding of CD28 on T cells with the B7 on
antigen-presenting cells).

(Choice D) Isotype switching is the process through which activated B lymphocytes switch
production from IgM immunoglobulins to IgG and IgA isotypes. This process requires the
interaction of CD40 on activated B cells with CD40 ligand expressed by activated T cells and is
modulated by cytokines secreted by T cells.

(Choice E) On exposure to an antigen, naive T helper (T,,0) cells differentiate into T,,1 (cell-
