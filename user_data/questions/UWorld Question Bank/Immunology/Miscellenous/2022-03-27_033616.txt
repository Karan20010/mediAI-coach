Inflammation is an important process in the defense against various pathogens. It is
characterized by the passage of leukocytes into the inflamed tissue. The following steps are
involved in inflammatory leukocyte accumulation:

1. Margination: Increased vascular leakage in the microvasculature leads to
hemoconcentration and decreased wall shear stress, improving the contact of neutrophils
with the endothelial lining (Choice B).

2. Rolling: Neutrophils roll on the endothelium via the loose binding of sialylated
carbohydrate groups, such as Sialyl Lewis X or PSGL-1, to L-selectin on neutrophils or E-
selectin/P-selectin on endothelial cells (Choice C). Cytokine stimulation greatly
increases expression of endothelial selectins.

3. Activation: Slow rolling allows the leukocytes to sample the chemokines secreted by the
inflamed tissue. This activates integrins by inducing a signaling cascade that results in a
conformational change in the integrins necessary for binding.
