while playing in the yard several days ago and has continued to have purulent drainage from
the wound. The patient has no significant medical history and is up to date with all
recommended vaccinations. Wound examination reveals a small retained foreign body with
surrounding necrotic tissue and pus. Anaerobic culture of the wound swab grows thin, gram-
positive rods with terminal spore, which is biochemically identified as Clostridium tetani. Which
of the following most likely protected this patient from developing neurological symptoms of the
infection?
