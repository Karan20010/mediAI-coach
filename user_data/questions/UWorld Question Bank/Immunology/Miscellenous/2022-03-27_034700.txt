(Choice A) Neutrophils do not directly kill malignant cells.

(Choice B) The functions of macrophages include phagocytosis, antigen presentation to T-
helper lymphocytes in association with MHC class II molecules, and secretion of
immunomodulatory cytokines, like TNF and IL-1.

(Choice C) Dendritic cells are avid antigen presenting cells that constantly sample their
environment by endocytosis and become activated upon encountering a foreign antigen.
When activated, dendritic cells migrate to the lymph nodes and spleen where they display
antigen with MHC II and co-stimulatory molecules to activate T-cells and B-cells.

(Choice D) CD4+ T-lymphocytes (T, cells) are activated by antigen presented in association
with MHC II molecules and can promote cell-mediated (macrophages and CD8®- cells) and/or
humoral (B-cells) immune responses.

(Choice E) B-cells transform into plasma cells under the influence of activated T,, cells.
Plasma cells secrete antigen-specific immunoglobulins.

Educational Objective:

NK cells recognize and kill cells with decreased MHC class | antigen cell surface expression,
such as virus-infected cells and tumor cells. They are large lymphocytes that contain perforins
