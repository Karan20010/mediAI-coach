(Choice C) CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity is a delayed rather than immediate
type of immune response. Type IV hypersensitivity is unique in that it is cell- versus antibody-
mediated (seen in types I-lll).

(Choice E) Complement-mediated cytotoxicity is a function of circulating IgM and IgG, not
IgE. This pathway plays a role in the damage associated with Type II and III hypersensitivity
reactions. IgM is the antibody most efficient at initiating the classical complement cascade
because it circulates as a pentamer (allows for increased complement interaction).

Educational objective:

Type | hypersensitivity reactions are mediated by the interaction of allergen with preexisting
IgE bound to basophils and mast cells. This facilitates cross-linking of the surface IgE
molecules that signals the cell to degranulate releasing chemical mediators (eg, histamine,
heparin). These agents are responsible for the immediate signs and symptoms of allergy, from
a local wheal and flare to life-threatening anaphylaxis.
