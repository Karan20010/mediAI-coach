sudden rash. He was trying to retrieve a baseball that had rolled under a log when he got
stung by something. By the time he told his mom, his body was covered in welts. His mother

gave him diphenhydramine, but the patient's face started to swell and he was having a hard
time swallowing. The patient's blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg and heart rate is 120/min.
Physical examination shows erythematous, raised plaques over the trunk, extremities, and

face. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral expiratory wheezes. The mother is not aware of the
