This patient developed localized erythema and vesicles 2 days after reexposure to a chemical
on patch testing, which identified the allergen responsible for allergic contact dermatitis
(ACD). ACD is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 phases:

¢ In the sensitization phase, cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (ie, allergens)
and present them to naive CD4- and CD8- T cells in the regional lymph nodes, resulting in
clonal expansion of hapten-sensitive T cells. This phase takes 10-14 days and does not
result in cutaneous lesions.

¢ On reexposure to the hapten, cutaneous antigen-presenting cells present the hapten to
sensitized T cells recruited to the skin. When activated, these T cells mediate tissue
damage that manifests as pruritic erythema, vesicles, and/or bullae. This elicitation
phase occurs 2-3 days following reexposure to the hapten.

(Choices A and E) In type | (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions, initial allergen exposure
leads to Th2 cell—induced, B-cell heavy-chain isotype switching and production of IgE, which
subsequently binds to mast cells. This is accomplished in part by the binding of CD40 on B
cells to CD40 ligand on T cells. On reexposure, allergens bind to IgE on mast cells and trigger
immediate release of vasoactive peptides, resulting in urticaria (and anaphylaxis if severe).

This inflammatory response is rapid (ie, minutes), unlike this patient's delayed (48-hr
