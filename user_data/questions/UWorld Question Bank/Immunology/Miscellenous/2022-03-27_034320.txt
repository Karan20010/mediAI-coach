Educational objective:

Immunoglobulin contains a Fab fragment that binds to antigen and an Fc fragment that
activates complement and/or interacts with immune cells. The Fc fragment of IgG activates
the classical complement cascade (constant heavy chain region 2) and serves as a ligand for

the Fc receptor on phagocytes (constant heavy chain region 3).
