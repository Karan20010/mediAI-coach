Educational objective:

T helper subtype 1 cells release interferon-gamma, leading to the activation of macrophages, a
process critical for control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Activated macrophages
form mature phagolysosomes that destroy phagocytosed mycobacteria and can differentiate
into epithelioid and Langhans giant cells to wall off extracellular mycobacteria within caseating

granulomas.
