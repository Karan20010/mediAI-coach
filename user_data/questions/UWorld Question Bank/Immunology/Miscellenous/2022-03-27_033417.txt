TAP = tr associated with antigen processing. = ©uworis
Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) proteins are transmembrane proteins
necessary for the presentation of cytosolic antigens on major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) molecules. When cellular proteins (or pathogen-derived proteins) are degraded by
proteasomes, some of the resulting peptide fragments are transported into the endoplasmic
reticulum by TAP proteins and loaded onto MHC class | molecules. The MHC class I-peptide
complexes then translocate to the cell surface where they can activate cytotoxic T cells
through interaction with T cell receptors and CD8 coreceptors.

The activated T cells clonally expand and kill damaged or infected cells by releasing cytotoxins
(eg, perforin, granzyme) that induce apoptosis. Genetic mutations (eg, TAP7) affecting MHC
class I-peptide complex expression (eg, bare lymphocyte syndrome type |) are rare but can
cause ulcerative, granulomatous skin lesions and frequent respiratory infections despite
normal lymphocyte and immunoglobulin levels.

(Choice A) B cell differentiation into plasma cells is impaired in common variable immune
deficiency, a multifactorial disorder without a clearly defined genetic basis. A decrease in the
overall production of immunoglobulin results in recurrent respiratory tract and gastrointestinal
infections.
