(Choice A) Activated macrophages engulf and digest foreign microbes and are the principal
cell type responsible for granuloma formation. Although macrophages help clear bacteria
locally from the wound, they would not be able to neutralize the tetanus toxin secreted by
Clostridium tetani.

(Choice B) Circulating antibodies bind to extracellular pathogens and promote complement
fixation and phagocytosis. Complement can opsonize and/or neutralize extracellular bacteria
but would not impair the activity of tetanus toxin.

(Choice D) Neutrophils are responsible for phagocytosis of foreign organisms and are part of
the initial response against extracellular pathogens. These cells play a role in nonspecific
innate immunity but are not effective in eliminating the tetanus toxoid.

(Choice E) Cytotoxic CD8 lymphocytes play an important role in host defense against viral
infections. They are also capable of destroying tumor cells and contribute to rejection
reactions.

Educational objective:
Clostridium tetani produces the neurotoxin tetanospasmin, which blocks inhibitory
neurotransmission in the spinal cord and leads to tonic muscular contraction. Tetanus is

prevented by immunization with an inactivated toxoid that triggers the production of antitoxin PCEVENO
