Educational objective:

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an IgA-mediated, leukocytoclastic vasculitis that presents with
palpable purpura, arthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain, and/or hematuria. Renal involvement is
due to mesangial deposition of IgA immune complexes with subsequent mesangial cell
proliferation, neutrophilic infiltration, and glomerular damage.
