Educational objective:

Tuberculin skin testing triggers a type IV delayed-hypersensitivity reaction in patients with
previous infection due to the presence of primed, antigen-specific CD4 T lymphocytes. These
lymphocytes recognize tuberculin proteins displayed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and
become activated following a costimulatory interaction between CD28 on the T cell and
CD80/86 on the APC.
