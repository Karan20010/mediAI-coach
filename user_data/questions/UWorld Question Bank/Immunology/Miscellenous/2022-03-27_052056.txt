Acute cardiac transplant rejection typically occurs within 6 months of transplantation and
can be diagnosed via endomyocardial biopsy. Acute rejection can be cell-mediated (ie, acute
cellular rejection [ACR]) or, less commonly, antibody-mediated (ie, acute antibody-mediated
rejection).

In ACR, host T-lymphocytes are sensitized against foreign human leukocyte antigens (HLA)
in the cardiac allograft, which leads to inflammation and injury to the transplanted organ.
Microscopic features of ACR include an interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate (primarily T-
lymphocytes) and damaged myocytes.

Symptoms consistent with progressive rejection include those found in systolic dysfunction
(eg, dyspnea on exertion). However, cardiac transplant recipients undergo close surveillance
with regular endomyocardial biopsies, and acute rejection is often diagnosed before patients
become symptomatic.

(Choice A) Concentric intimal thickening of the coronary arteries can be seen in cardiac
allograft vasculopathy, an important cause of ischemic damage and long-term graft
dysfunction. The pathogenesis is complex and includes the release of cytokines that cause
smooth muscle cell proliferation in the vessel wall.
