Natural killer (NK) cells are responsible for the destruction of cells with decreased or absent
MHC class | proteins on their surfaces. Such changes in MHC | antigen expression occur in
virus-infected cells and tumor cells. Natural killer cells are derived from lymphoid stem cells
and comprise approximately 10% of all circulating lymphocytes. They are large cells with
cytoplasmic granules containing perforins, which produce holes in target cell membranes, and
granzymes, chemicals that induce target cell apoptosis. Granzymes gain access to the target
cell via membrane holes created by perforin. The target cell subsequently undergoes
apoptosis. NK cells do not directly lyse cells.

NK cells:

1. Do not express CD4, CD8 or CD3 molecules on their surface. They do express either
CD16 or CD 56.

2. Do not require the thymus for maturation and are present in athymic patients.

3. Have no antigen-specific activities, do not require exposure to antigen for activation, and
do not possess antigen memory ability.

4. Are activated by interferon-y and IL-12.
