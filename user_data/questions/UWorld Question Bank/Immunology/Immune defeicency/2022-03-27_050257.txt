(Choice A) All immunoglobulin levels are decreased/absent in X-linked agammaglobulinemia
due to impaired B-cell maturation. Severe sinopulmonary and invasive bacterial infections
begin in infancy, and failure to thrive is typical. Without immunoglobulin replacement most
children will have near fatal infections early in life.

(Choice B) Chronic eczema without an underlying immunodeficiency can cause elevated IgE,
and IgG may also be high if the rash is superinfected. However, the affected area would be
erythematous and tender, unlike this patient's cold abscess, making isolated atopic disease
unlikely.

(Choice C) Hyper-lIgM syndrome, in which immunoglobulin class-switching is impaired due to
CD40 ligand deficiency, typically presents in infancy with sinopulmonary and opportunistic
infections. Recurrent cold skin abscesses do not typically occur.

(Choice E) Selective IgA deficiency can cause recurrent sinopulmonary infections and is
associated with an increased risk for atopy. However, skin infections would not be expected.

Educational objective:

Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by elevated IgE levels and is caused by impaired
neutrophil activation and migration due to a defect in T-helper cell type 17 cells. Typical
findings include noninflammatory (ie, cold) abscesses, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and
