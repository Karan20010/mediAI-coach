(Choice D) In Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, functioning of both T and B cells is impaired due to
abnormal cytoskeletal functioning. Patients experience recurrent viral, bacterial, and fungal
infections that generally worsen with age. However, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome also typically
causes bleeding due to thrombocytopenia and eczema.

(Choice E) X-linked (Bruton's) agammaglobulinemia is an immunodeficiency syndrome
caused by insufficient production of mature B cells, which predisposes mainly to recurrent
infections with encapsulated pyogenic bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus
influenzae type B). The quantity and functioning of T cells is generally not affected, so an
absent thymic shadow is unlikely.

Educational objective:

Severe combined immune deficiency is characterized by combined T and B cell dysfunction. It
is a life-threatening condition that presents in infancy with severe bacterial and viral infections;
mucocutaneous candidiasis; persistent diarrhea; and failure to thrive. Laboratory findings
include absent T cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. The thymic shadow is not usually
present due to severe T cell deficiency.
