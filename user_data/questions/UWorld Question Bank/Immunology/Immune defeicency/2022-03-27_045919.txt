This patient's recurrent sinopulmonary infections, Giardia lamblia gastroenteritis, failure to
thrive, and low immunoglobulin levels are suggestive of X-linked agammaglobulinemia
(XLA). In this condition, a mutation in the Bruton tyrosine kinase gene causes failure of bone
marrow pre-B cells to develop into mature B cells, a step necessary for B cells to leave the
bone marrow and enter the peripheral circulation.

Patients with XLA have low or absent B cells in the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues
and pan-hypogammaglobulinemia (ie, very low IgG, IgM, and IgA). As a result, they are at
increased risk of infection with pyogenic (encapsulated) bacteria. Patients also have
increased susceptibility to certain viral and parasitic infections, such as enteroviruses and
Giardia lamblia, due to the absence of opsonizing and neutralizing antibodies.

Flow cytometry can be used to assess the number of circulating B cells by using fluorescent
tags that bind to specific B cell surface proteins such as CD19, CD20, anacpa1

(Choices A and B) CD4 is a helper T cell surface marker, and CD8 is a cytotoxic T cell
surface marker. Both B cells and T cells can be deficient in patients with certain forms of
severe combined immunodeficiency. However, these patients typically have failure to thrive,
persistent mucosal candidiasis, and severe infections with opportunistic organisms (eg,
