A 15-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to fever and foot swelling.
The patient first developed swelling of the right foot and fever 4 days ago. Today, swelling of
the left foot also developed. Medical history is significant for a perianal abscess at 9 months of
age. Imaging studies reveal osteomyelitis affecting the metatarsal bones of both feet.
Intravenous antimicrobials are administered, but the patient still has fever and bilateral foot
swelling 2 weeks later. Laboratory workup shows persistent neutrophilic leukocytosis. Bone
biopsy culture grows Staphylococcus aureus. Evaluation for an underlying diagnosis is
initiated; via use of a rhodamine derivative, the patient's peripheral blood is stimulated with
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and compared with a control. Results of the test are shown

in the image below:
