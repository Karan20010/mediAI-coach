with a keto group, leading to the formation of inosine/deoxyinosine. These compounds are
subsequently converted into nontoxic waste products (hypoxanthine and uric acid) and are
excreted.

ADA inhibition results in the metabolism of deoxyadenosine through an alternate pathway,
whereby it is phosphorylated into the toxic metabolite deoxyadenosine triphosphate.
Elevated intracellular levels of deoxyadenosine triphosphate activate the caspase system and
also inhibit ribonucleotide reductase from converting ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides,
which depletes cells of DNA precursors. This ultimately results in the inhibition of DNA
synthesis/repair and subsequent apoptosis.

Although all human cells contain ADA, developing lymphocytes are among the most mitotically
active cells; the inhibition/absence of ADA is highly lymphocytotoxic. Therefore, ADA
inhibitors (eg, cladribine) can be used to treat lymphocyte-derived cancers such as hairy cell
leukemia. Similarly, children born with mutations to both ADA genes have dramatic B- and T-
lymphocyte impairment, leading to the most severe form of severe combined
immunodeficiency.

(Choices B, C, and E) Malignant melanoma is an aggressive melanocyte tumor that
metastasizes early and is associated with high mortality rates when diagnosed at an advanced
