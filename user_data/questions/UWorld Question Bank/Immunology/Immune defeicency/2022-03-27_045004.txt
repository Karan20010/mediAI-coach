This patient has a severe diarrheal illness, failure to thrive, and a history of recurrent

respiratory infections; findings concerning for a primary immunodeficiency. In this case,
the absent CD40 ligand (CD40L) on flow cytometry is diagnostic for hyper-lgM syndrome.

CD4OL is normally present on activated CD4- T cells and interacts primarily with CD40 on B
cells in the secondary germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This T-cell-dependent interaction
is required to form B-cell germinal centers; without it, patients with hyper-IgM syndrome

lack secondary germinal centers and often have small/nonpalpable lymph nodes.

Because the interaction of CD40L with CD40 allows for B-cell activation and differentiation into
immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells and memory B cells, lack of CD40L causes B cells to
remain in their native IgM-producing state. Without opsonizing IgG antibody, patients with
hyper-IgM syndrome are predisposed to recurrent sinopulmonary infections (eg,
pneumonia, sinusitis) caused by encapsulated bacteria. In addition, lack of mucosal IgA
increases the risk for gastrointestinal infections (eg, Giardia). Failure to thrive is also
common because of increased metabolic demands from recurrent infections, as well as
nutrient loss from chronic diarrhea.
