(Choices B and E) Catalase-negative organisms (eg, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus
pyogenes) cannot prevent the accumulation of H.O, within phagosomes, a process that allows

the phagocytes to generate potent microbicidal agents (eg, hypochlorite) and activate granule
proteases even when host O,~ production is impaired.

(Choices C and D) Patients with CGD are at increased risk of bacterial and fungal infections,
not parasitic (Giardia lamblia) or viral (herpes simplex virus type 1) infections.

Educational objective:

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) results from defective NADPH oxidase. Normally, this

enzyme participates in the respiratory burst pathway to produce reactive oxygen species

critical in intracellular pathogen killing. Patients with CGD develop recurrent bacterial and

fungal infections predominantly caused by 5 catalase-positive organisms: Staphylococcus AGiVEKe Winelone
