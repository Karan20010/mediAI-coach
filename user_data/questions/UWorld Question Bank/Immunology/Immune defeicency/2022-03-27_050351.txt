(Choices B and E) Disrupted phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils refers to the
impaired engulfing of organisms, which can occur when opsonization is absent due to antibody
or complement deficiency. In contrast, this patient's serum immunoglobulin levels are normal.

(Choice C) Dysfunctional neutrophil trafficking is seen in leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD)
and causes impaired leukocyte migration. Patients have recurrent mucosal infections and skin
abscesses without pus, often due to S aureus, but recurrent lymphadenitis and Aspergillus
infection would not be expected. Moreover, marked leukocytosis (often >50,000/mmz) is

typical with LAD because leukocytes cannot migrate out of blood vessels.

Educational objective:

Chronic granulomatous disease should be suspected in a child with recurrent infections by
catalase-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus) who has normal
immunoglobulins and no leukopenia. Pathogenesis involves the defective intracellular killing
of phagocytized organisms within neutrophils due to an impaired respiratory burst.
