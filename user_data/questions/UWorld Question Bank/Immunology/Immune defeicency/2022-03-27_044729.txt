(Choice C) In patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), neutrophils are unable to
kill catalase-producing organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) due to a deficiency of NADPH
oxidase. CGD is not associated with oculocutaneous albinism or giant cytoplasmic granules.

(Choice D) Gaucher disease is a lysosomal storage disorder that causes bone pain,
hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Tissue biopsies show macrophages with a crumpled-
paper appearance due to glucocerebroside accumulation.

(Choice E) Neutrophils in leukocyte adhesion deficiency are unable to adhere to vascular
endothelium or migrate to sites of infection. Patients have recurrent skin infections and poor
wound healing, but silvery hair, nystagmus, and giant granules are not seen.

(Choice F) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by
immunodeficiency (combined B- and T-lymphocyte deficiency), bleeding due to
thrombocytopenia, and eczema (not seen in this patient). Small platelets are present on
peripheral smear, and oculocutaneous albinism is not seen.

Educational objective:
ChÃ©diak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting lysosomal trafficking
that results in immunodeficiency, albinism, neurologic abnormalities (eg, nystagmus). Giant

granules are seen within neutrophils.
