MACs are the most important initial defense against encapsulated bacteria because they
operate at high efficiency despite the presence of a capsule. Therefore, patients with deficits
in any of the terminal complement proteins that generate the MAC are at very high risk for
recurrent encapsulated bacterial infections (as seen in this patient). Laboratory evaluation
of these patients will show reduced activity of the classical (CH50) and alternative (AH50)
complement cascades because all 3 complement pathways (classical, alternative, lectin)
terminate in the generation of MACs.

(Choices B and C) Deficiency in complement proteins unique to the classical cascade (eg,
Ciq/r/s, C2, C4) will result in low CH50 and normal AHS0 levels. In contrast, deficiency in
complement proteins unique to the alternative cascade (eg, factor B, factor D) will result in
normal CH50 and low AHSO levels. This patient's recurrent N meningitidis infections are more
characteristic of a terminal complement component deficiency.

(Choice D) Patients with a defect in the lectin complement pathway (eg, mannose-binding
lectin) will have normal CH50 and AHSO levels. Additional evaluation with the mannose-
binding lectin test can usually reveal the presence of this abnormality.
