Educational objective:

Chronic granulomatous disease is a primary immunodeficiency due to impaired NADPH
oxidase, an enzyme that generates reactive oxygen species in phagolysosomes. Diminished
intracellular killing within neutrophils leads to susceptibility to recurrent infection with catalase-
producing bacteria (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Nocardia) and fungi (eg, Aspergillus).
