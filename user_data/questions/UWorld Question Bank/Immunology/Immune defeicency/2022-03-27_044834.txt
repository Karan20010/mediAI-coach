patches in his mouth. His past medical history is significant for 3 episodes of otitis media and
2 episodes of bronchiolitis that have required hospitalization. He also has a history of chronic
loose stools. The child is small for his age and ill-appearing. Head and neck examination
shows white patches consistent with oral candidiasis but is otherwise normal. Auscultation of
