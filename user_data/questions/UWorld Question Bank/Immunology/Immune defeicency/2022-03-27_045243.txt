Educational objective:

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is due to defective NADPH oxidase and is diagnosed
by dihydrorhodamine testing, which measures neutrophil respiratory burst. When NADPH
oxidase is stimulated, dihydrorhodamine is normally oxidized and fluoresces green (increased
fluorescence intensity); it remains colorless (ie, no oxidation) in patients with CGD.
