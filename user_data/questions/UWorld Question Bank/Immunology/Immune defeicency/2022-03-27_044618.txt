recurrent infections, and thrombocytopenia. Because it is an X-linked recessive disorder,
WAS manifests almost exclusively in males. It is caused by a mutation in cytoskeleton
proteins that are critical for normal cell structure and the cell-to-cell interactions required for
activation of hematologic cells (eg, platelets, immune cells).

In patients with WAS, platelets are both abnormally shaped and deficient, causing petechiae,
purpura, hematemesis, and epistaxis that can be present at birth. A deficiency in B cells
results in recurrent pyogenic infections due to an inability to mount a humoral immune
response against organisms with a polysaccharide capsule (eg, Neisseria meningitidis,
Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Patients also have T-cell deficiency,
leading to infections with opportunistic pathogens (eg, Pneumocystis jiroveci). Severe
recurrent infections develop after transplacental maternal IgG and maternal mucosal IgA are
degraded around 6 months of age. Treatment is with HLA-matched bone marrow
transplantation.

(Choice A) Aplastic anemia (ie, pancytopenia) classically results from ionizing radiation or the

use of cytotoxic medications (eg, chemotherapeutic agents, chloramphenicol). Although
aplastic anemia is associated with recurrent infections, abnormally shaped platelets and
