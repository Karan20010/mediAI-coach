This patient's recurrent infections, failure to thrive, and defective signaling between CD4 cells
and B cells indicate hyper-lgM syndrome, a genetic disorder most often caused by mutations
in CD40 ligand (CD40L).

CD4OL is expressed on the surface of activated CD4 cells. It binds to CD40 on activated B-

cells, which is required for B-cells to undergo class-switch recombination, allowing them to

produce IgE, IgA, or IgG instead of IgM and IgD. Cytokines released by nearby CD4 T cells

determine which isotype is produced by promoting specific splicing of the heavy-chain

constant region. The heavy-chain variable region, which binds antigenic epitopes, is

unaffected.

Because patients with defects in CD40L are unable to generate significant immunoglobulins

other than IgM, laboratory evaluation shows elevated IgM and absent or low IgE, IgA, and

IgG. Common manifestations of hyper-IgM syndrome include the following:

¢ Sinopulmonary infections (eg, pneumonia, otitis media) due to insufficient opsonizing

IgG to help clear encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae)

¢ Chronic diarrhea (eg, Giardia lamblia) due to an absence of significant IgA at the mucosal
