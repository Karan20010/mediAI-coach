(Choice A) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency, or a defect in CD18-containing integrins, is
characterized by impaired leukocyte migration (chemotaxis) to sites of inflammation, leading to
recurrent mucosal infections and abscesses that lack pus. Neutrophilic leukocytosis is
common, but DHR testing would be normal.

(Choice B) Complement deficiencies often present with recurrent Neisseria infections, not S
aureus osteomyelitis. Neutrophil respiratory burst on DHR testing would be normal.

(Choice C) Opsonization is impaired in patients lacking IgG (eg, X-linked
agammaglobulinemia). The typical presentation involves recurrent sinopulmonary infections
by encapsulated bacteria, not S aureus. Moreover, this patient's DHR test is diagnostic of
CGD.

(Choice E) Impaired T-lymphocyte function (eg, HIV infection) predisposes patients to severe,
recurrent bacterial, viral, and fungal opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii).
Neutrophil respiratory burst would not be affected.
