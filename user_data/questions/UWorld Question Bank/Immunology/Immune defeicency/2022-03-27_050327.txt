X-linked recessive mutation of NADPH oxidase
Impaired respiratory burst & | reactive oxygen species — inhibition
of phagocytic intracellular killing

© Fungi: Aspergillus
Clinical e Recurrent infections of lungs, skin, liver, lymph nodes
features ¢ Diffuse granuloma formation
¢ Measurement of neutrophil superoxide production
Diagnosis o DHR flow cytometry (preferred)

o NBT testing
