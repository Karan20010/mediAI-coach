(Choice B) Deficiencies of C5-C9, the components of the complement membrane attack
complex, can lead to recurrent infections with Neisseria meningitidis or gonorrhoeae.

(Choice D) Isotype switching is a process that occurs in naive B lymphocytes on initial
exposure to antigen. It is dependent on the interaction of CD40 with its ligand and cytokines
including IL-4 and IL-5, which promote IgE and IgA class switching, respectively.

(Choice E) Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is a rare immunodeficiency resulting from a defect
in CD18, an integrin component that allows for leukocyte adherence and transmigration
through endothelial walls. These patients present with delayed separation of the umbilical
cord, poor wound healing, and recurrent cutaneous infections without pus formation.

Educational objective:
