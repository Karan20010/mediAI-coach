Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a group of X-linked and autosomal recessive
genetic disorders marked by the impaired development and activity of both T-lymphocytes

and B-lymphocytes.

Loss of T-lymphocyte activity results in deficient cell-mediated immunity, leading to
recurrent viral, fungal, and opportunistic (eg, Pneumocystis jirovecii) infections. Because T-
lymphocytes are required for B-cells to produce IgG and IgA (T-cell-induced immunoglobulin
class switching), patients with SCID also have a dramatic impairment in humoral immunity;
this is typically marked by recurrent sinopulmonary bacterial infections (eg, pneumonia, otitis
media) and chronic diarrhea due to the lack of IgG and IgA. Recurrent infections often cause
failure to thrive.

Laboratory findings of SCID include lymphopenia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Stem cell
transplant is the only treatment.

(Choice A) Agammaglobulinemia is an isolated B cell defect that manifests with recurrent
sinopulmonary bacterial infections. Infection with Pneumocystis jirovecii is not seen in isolated
B cell defects because this infection is primarily countered by the cell-mediated immune
response.
