bacterial cell and undergoes amplification. The alternative pathway generates the opsonin
C3b (which increases bacterial phagocytosis), but it primarily kills encapsulated bacteria via
the creation of membrane attack complexes (MACs). MACs form pores in the bacterial
surface, leading to membrane destabilization and osmotic lysis. Therefore, patients who have
defects in the complement proteins that generate the MAC (C5-C9) are at risk for recurrent,
life-threatening infections from encapsulated bacteria.

(Choice A) DiGeorge syndrome causes T-cell lymphopenia due to congenital absence of the
thymus and parathyroid glands. Absent T-cells cause recurrent viral and fungal infections, not
recurrent bacteremia.

(Choice B) Excessive IgE production is seen in hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome. Although
recurrent sinopulmonary infection is common, patients also have severe eczema and recurrent
abscesses.

(Choice C) Impaired neutrophil chemotaxis is seen in leukocyte adhesion defects, which
prevent neutrophil extravasation and migration to areas of infection. Although recurrent
bacterial infection is common, patients often have a variety of other findings (eg, absence of
pus, delayed umbilical cord separation, impaired wound healing).
