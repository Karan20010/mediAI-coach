Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) is a life-threatening immunodeficiency
syndrome that presents in infancy. It is caused by a variety of mutations in different genes
that result in impaired T and B cell development and function. This leads to compromised cell-
mediated and humoral immunity with the eventual development of severe viral and bacterial
infections as maternal immunity wanes. Other common features include mucocutaneous
candidiasis, persistent diarrhea, and failure to thrive. Laboratory studies show very low or
absent CD3+ T cells and hypogammaglobulinemia. Thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is
another common finding in infants with SCID due to severe T cell deficiency.

(Choice A) Common variable immunodeficiency is a heterogenous condition caused by B and
T cell dysfunction and characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia. It presents with recurrent
infections in adults and children (after the neonatal period). While not entirely unaffected, cell-
mediated immunity is not as impaired as in SCID and thymic aplasia is unlikely.

(Choice B) DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) classically presents with craniofacial abnormalities,
conotruncal cardiac anomalies, hypoplastic thymus, and hypocalcemia resulting from
parathyroid hypoplasia. Immunodeficiency can also occur and is related to the degree of
thymic hypoplasia. Although complete DGS (<1% of cases) is a form of SCID, the absence of

other characteristic findings makes DGS a less likely diagnosis.
