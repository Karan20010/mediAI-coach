Intradermal injection of Candida antigens triggers a delayed type IV hypersensitivity
reaction, which allows evaluation of the cell-mediated immune response.

Injected Candida antigens are taken up by cutaneous antigen presenting cells (APCs), which
display the antigens on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules to naive CD4
cells. These cells are then induced to differentiate into type | helper (Th1) cells that secrete
tumor necrosis factor and interferon-gamma, which recruit and activate macrophages. The
macrophages phagocytose Candida antigens and secrete additional inflammatory mediators,
producing a cutaneous inflammatory response that appears as an indurated wheal within 24-
48 hours.

Because exposure to Candida is ubiquitous, all healthy patients have memory T-cells against
Candida. Failure to generate an appropriate cutaneous response indicates that the cell-
mediated immune response is impaired (ie, T-cell anergy). Patients with SCID have T-cell
dysfunction; therefore, they will show anergy in response to Candida challenge.

(Choices A and B) B lymphocytes produce antibodies and are the main effectors of humoral
immunity. Antibodies play a prominent role in type | (IgE-mediated), type II (eg, drug-induced
hemolytic anemia), and type III (eg, serum sickness) hypersensitivity reactions (but not type IV

reactions).
