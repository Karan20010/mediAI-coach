(Choice C) NADPH oxidase is the enzyme that is deficient in chronic granulomatous disease
(CGD). Without NADPH oxidase, neutrophils are unable to form reactive oxygen species such
as superoxide. CGD manifests clinically with recurrent infections by catalase-producing
organisms (eg, staphylococci). Dihydrorhodamine or nitroblue tetrazolium testing can be used
to diagnose CGD.

(Choice D) Reverse transcriptase is a retroviral enzyme that converts viral genomic RNA (in
this case, ADA) to DNA. Although it plays a role in the effectiveness of the retrovirus as a
vector for the treatment of SCID, reverse transcriptase is not deficient in patients with this
condition.

(Choice E) Xanthine oxidase is the enzyme responsible for the formation of uric acid from
hypoxanthine and xanthine and is essential as the final step of purine degradation. Xanthine
oxidase deficiency leads to abnormally low levels of uric acid in the serum; it can also lead to
renal calculi due to the relative insolubility of xanthine at urine's pH level.

Educational objective:
The second most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency is autosomal
recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme necessary for the elimination of

excess adenosine within cells. Toxic levels of adenosine accumulate within lymphocytes in
