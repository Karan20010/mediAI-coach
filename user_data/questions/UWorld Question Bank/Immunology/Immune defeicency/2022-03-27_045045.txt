joice A) Absent thymic tissue, which can be seen in DiGeorge syndrome, results In absen
T-cell production. T-cell deficiency presents with opportunistic infections and failure to thrive in
infancy but would be associated with absence of CD4- T cells themselves (not just CD40L).

(Choice B) Giant granules within neutrophils is a pathognomonic finding for Chédiak-Higashi
syndrome, a condition caused by impaired intracellular trafficking of vesicles (eg, lysosomes,
melanosomes). In addition to pyogenic infections, patients typically have oculocutaneous
albinism and neurologic dysfunction.

(Choice C) Hypoplastic bone marrow is seen with aplastic anemia. Recurrent infections
occur due to the absence of leukocyte production, but signs of anemia (eg, fatigue, pallor) and
thrombocytopenia (eg, bleeding, bruising) are also typically present.

(Choice E) Small-volume platelets are characteristic of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, in which a
defect in the leukocyte cytoskeleton leads to recurrent infections.

Educational objective:

Hyper-IgM syndrome presents with recurrent sinopulmonary and gastrointestinal infections
due to the absence of CD40 ligand on CD4- T cells. Lack of interaction between CD40L and

CD40 on B cells prevents the development of secondary germinal centers and impairs B-cell

activation and immunoglobulin class switching.
