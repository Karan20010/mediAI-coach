This young woman's rapid-onset high fever, confusion, neck stiffness, and petechial rash likely
indicate bacterial meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis infection. Although healthy,
college-aged individuals are at high risk for a single episode of bacterial meningitis, this
patient's recurrent pneumonia and previous meningitis suggest an underlying immune system

impairment. Culture results from her previous infections are unknown, but the leading cause
of pneumonia and meningitis is Streptococcus pneumoniae.

The major virulence factor for both N meningitidis and S pneumoniae is a polysaccharide
capsule, which allows the bacteria to evade the following host defenses:

¢ Phagocytosis: Capsules have a negative charge, which repels the negative charge of
the phagocyte surface. Capsules are also hydrophilic, which reduces surface tension at
the interface between the capsule and the phagocyte, making engulfment more difficult.

¢ Opsonization: Capsules cover underlying antigenic epitopes on the bacterial cell
membrane, which limits immunoglobulin binding. This impairs immunoglobulin-mediated
opsonization and classical complement pathway activation.

Therefore, initial control of encapsulated bacterial infections is largely dependent on the
alternative complement cascade, which is triggered when autoactivated C3 lands on the

bacterial cell and undergoes amplification. The alternative pathway generates the opsonin
