Educational objective:

The second most common cause of severe combined immunodeficiency is autosomal
recessive deficiency of adenosine deaminase, an enzyme necessary for the elimination of
excess adenosine within cells. Toxic levels of adenosine accumulate within lymphocytes in
this condition, leading to lymphocyte cell death and resultant cellular and humoral
immunodeficiency. Patients with this condition can be treated with hematopoietic cell

transplantation or gene therapy.
