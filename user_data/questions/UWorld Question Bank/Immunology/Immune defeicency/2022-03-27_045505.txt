Hyper-IgM syndrome is usually caused by a defect in CD40 ligand, which prevents B cells
from undergoing class-switch recombination. Clinical features include recurrent
sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal (eg, Giardia), and opportunistic infections. Laboratory findings
include elevated IgM and low or absent IgG, IgA, and IgE.
