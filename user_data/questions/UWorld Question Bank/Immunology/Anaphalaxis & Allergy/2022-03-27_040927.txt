a ¢ Beta-2: causes bronchodilation, relieving airflow obstruction
= Because of its ability to both treat and prevent further inflammatory mediator effects,
7 epinephrine is the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis.
8
9 (Choice A) H1 antagonists (eg, diphenhydramine) block tissue histamine receptors,
s preventing the effects of circulating histamine on capillaries (eg, vasodilation, increased
2 vascular permeability). However, they do not decrease the mast cell release of histamine or
13 . .
44 other inflammatory mediators.
= (Choice B) Omalizumab is a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody that binds to free IgE at the same
47 site where IgE normally binds to mast cell IgE Fc receptors. It prevents receptor binding and
decreases circulating IgE levels, which eventually induces IgE Fc receptor down-regulation to
help stabilize mast cells.
(Choice C) Zileuton, a medication commonly used in the management of asthma, decreases
the leukocyte synthesis of leukotrienes by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase. This results in decreased
leukotriene activity, reducing inflammation and bronchospasm.
(Choice E) Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by several mechanisms. One such
mechanism is by promoting eosinophil apoptosis, either directly or by decreasing production of dive
