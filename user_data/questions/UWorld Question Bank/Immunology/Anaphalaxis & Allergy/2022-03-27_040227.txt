Educational objective:

Wheal-and-flare lesions usually result from allergic (type | hypersensitivity) reactions. On initial
exposure, an allergen (eg, insect venom) promotes antibody class switching to IgE.
Subsequent exposure promotes cross-linking of IgE on basophils and mast cells, resulting in
degranulation and release of multiple vasoactive mediators, including histamine.
