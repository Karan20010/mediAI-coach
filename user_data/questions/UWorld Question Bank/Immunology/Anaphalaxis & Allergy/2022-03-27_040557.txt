Angioedema is a rare and potentially serious adverse effect of ACE inhibitor therapy.
Symptoms typically appear within days of initiation but can also occur after weeks to years of
therapy. Although angioedema can affect any tissue, it most commonly involves the tongue,
lips, or eyelids. Laryngeal edema and difficulty breathing may also occur.

ACE inhibitor-induced angioedema is due to bradykinin accumulation. Normally, ACE is
responsible for bradykinin breakdown. ACE inhibitors prevent bradykinin degradation, leading
to increased levels. Bradykinin is a potent vasodilator that ultimately increases vascular
permeability, causing significant angioedema. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in

patients who develop angioedema.

(Choice B) Hereditary C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency also causes bradykinin-mediated
angioedema, but it usually presents in childhood and early adolescence. This patient's age
and history make ACE inhibitor-induced bradykinin accumulation more likely.

(Choice C) Even though IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation can cause angioedema, it is
more commonly associated with urticaria and pruritus. True hypersensitivity or an allergy to
ACE inhibitors is very rare and not likely in this patient.

(Choice D) ACE inhibitors decrease production of angiotensin II, which reduces negative
feedback on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, thereby promoting renin release.
