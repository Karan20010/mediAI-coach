(Choice B) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with increased antistreptolysin
O titers, complement activation, and low levels of C3. The typical presentation is hematuria or
nephritic syndrome following respiratory infection.

(Choice D) Complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis can result from autoantibodies
(autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or from direct complement activation (paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria); however, neither condition results from excessive C1 activity.

(Choice E) Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are associated with
idiopathic angioedema, function by blocking ACE and result in increased renin levels. ACE
also degrades bradykinin.

Educational objective:

C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency causes increased cleavage of C2 and C4 and results in
inappropriate activation of the complement cascade. C1INH also blocks kallikrein-induced
conversion of kininogen to bradykinin, a potent vasodilator associated with angioedema.
