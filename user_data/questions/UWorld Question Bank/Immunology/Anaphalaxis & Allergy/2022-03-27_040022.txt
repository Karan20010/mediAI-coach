Chimeric monoclonal antibodies such as infliximab contain amino acid sequences from
human and non-human (eg, mice) sources. These proteins are processed by antigen
presenting cells, displayed on class I] major histocompatibility complexes, and the nonhuman
components are recognized as foreign by patrolling CD4 cells. The CD4 cells then stimulate
activated B-cells to undergo somatic hypermutation and class switching, which generates
plasma cells that secrete high-affinity IgG antibodies against foreign components of the
drug.

With subsequent infusions, the foreign proteins in the medication trigger memory B cells to
differentiate into plasma cells, which generate a burst of IgG against the monoclonal antibody.
Binding of the IgG to the medication generates immune complexes (ICs), which are then
cleared by mononuclear phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system, as follows:

¢ Classic complement activation: The Fc portion of the bound IgG activates the classical
complement system, leading to the generation of C3b on the IC. C3b binds to CR1 on
erythrocytes/leukocytes, which bring the IC to reticuloendothelial mononuclear phagocytes
(eg, Kupffer cells, splenic macrophages) for clearance.

¢ Direct removal: Mononuclear phagocytes bind to the Fc portion of the bound IgG using
