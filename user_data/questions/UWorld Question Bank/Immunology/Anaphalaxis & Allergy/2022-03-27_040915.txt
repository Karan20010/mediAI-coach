This patient with sudden-onset rash and hypotension after ingesting a likely allergen has
anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis classically involves a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction
to an antigen, resulting in IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation. Sudden and
massive release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) into the circulation
can quickly lead to urticaria, oropharyngeal edema (eg, lip swelling), and shock (eg,
hypotension, tachycardia).

Epinephrine is the only pharmacologic therapy that both decreases the release of
inflammatory mediators from mast cells and addresses all other manifestations of
anaphylaxis. It binds to adrenergic receptors (eg, beta-2 receptors) on the surface of mast
cells, inhibiting mast cell degranulation. In addition, it counteracts existing inflammatory
effects via widespread stimulation of alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors:

e Alpha-1: causes vasoconstriction and decreases vascular permeability, raising blood
pressure and decreasing upper airway edema

¢ Beta-1: increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output, improving blood pressure and

peripheral perfusion

¢ Beta-2: causes bronchodilation, relieving airflow obstruction
