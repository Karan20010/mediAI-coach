This patient with throat tightness, dizziness, hypotension, and urticaria (ie, diffuse
erythematous plaques) has anaphylaxis, a type | (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction that
occurs in response to an allergen (eg, wasp venom).

In patients who will eventually develop anaphylaxis, the initial exposure to an allergen results
in antibody class switching and the production of allergen-specific IgE by plasma cells. The
allergen-specific IgE then binds to an IgE receptor on mast cells or basophils. Subsequent
reexposure leads to allergen interaction with cell-bound IgE, IgE receptor aggregation, mast
cell or basophil degranulation, and release of chemical mediators (histamine, prostaglandin,

leukotrienes) that can cause anaphylactic shock.

Anaphylactic shock is characterized by profound peripheral vasodilation. Arteriolar
vasodilation causes decreased systemic vascular resistance and consequent hypotension;
venular vasodilation causes decreased central venous pressure and reduces venous return to
the right atrium. In addition, the inflammatory chemical mediators increase vascular
permeability, leading to large fluid shifts from the intravascular to the extravascular space;
this decreases intravascular volume and worsens hypotension.
