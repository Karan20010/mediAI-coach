Educational objective:

Vasovagal syncope is a known complication of vaccine administration, particularly in
adolescents. It typically involves a prodrome and can be differentiated from anaphylaxis
based on skin findings (pallor vs urticaria), absence of respiratory symptoms (eg, upper airway
edema, bronchospasm), and presence of bradycardia (vs tachycardia).
