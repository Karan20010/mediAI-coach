This patient with allergic rhinitis has been prescribed fluticasone, an intranasal
glucocorticoid.
Glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptors and translocate to the nucleus where they
inhibit transcription of genes that encode inflammatory mediators and decrease immune

cell survival and propagation. This results in wide-ranging effects that suppress
immunostimulatory activity of all leukocyte cell lines, including the following:

¢ Decreased tissue production of proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes through
the inhibition of phospholipase A,

¢ Decreased synthesis of almost all proinflammatory cytokines, with increased anti-
inflammatory cytokine (eg, IL-10) production

¢ Impaired macrophage activation and neutrophil emigration

¢ Increased apoptosis of eosinophils, T cells, and monocytes, perhaps by decreasing Bcl-
2 expression

Glucocorticoids also act on nonimmune cells in the nose (including epithelial cells, goblet cells,
and vascular endothelial cells) to decrease uptake of allergen particles, decrease mucus
