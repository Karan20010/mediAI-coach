A 36-year-old woman with fistulizing perianal Crohn disease comes to the office for a follow-up
appointment. Eight weeks ago, the patient began receiving intermittent injections of infliximab,
a chimeric human-mouse monoclonal antibody targeted against tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
She reports improvement in fistula discharge and discomfort but has experienced fever, diffuse
joint pain, and an itchy rash 5-7 days after each of the recent treatments. The symptoms
spontaneously resolve after 2-3 days. The patient has no other medical conditions and has no
history of drug allergies. A delayed drug reaction due to formation of antibodies against foreign
drug components is suspected. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible
for resolution of these drug reactions?

©) A. Activation of the mononuclear phagocyte system

©) B. Apoptosis of tissue mast cells and eosinophils

() C. Clearance of intact drug molecules by kidneys

() D. Endocytosis and degradation of mast cell-bound IgE

() E. Regulatory T-cell-mediated cytotoxic T-cell suppression
