(sensitization) to the medication. This patient who has never received vancomycin is unlikely
to have an antibody-mediated reaction; furthermore, such reactions are rare with vancomycin
and are usually marked by urticaria, pruritus, hypotension, and angioedema.

(Choice E) Serotonergic drug interactions are most common with drugs that affect the
serotonin system such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and
certain antiemetics (eg, ondansetron). However, most cases are marked by alterations in
autonomic function (eg, hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia), and rash is unusual.

Educational objective:

Red man syndrome (RMS) is the most common adverse reaction to vancomycin. It occurs
due to rapid vancomycin infusion, which leads to the direct activation of mast cells and the
subsequent release of vasoactive mediators. Patients develop flushing, pruritus, and an
erythematous rash on the upper torso, face, and neck within minutes of initiation. Because
RMS is not a true allergic reaction (not IgE mediated), vancomycin can be restarted at a
slower rate of infusion once symptoms resolve.
