This child is experiencing a local allergic reaction (type | hypersensitivity) to an insect sting.
The cutaneous findings are consistent with a wheal-and-flare reaction, an erythematous
papule or plaque often with central pallor (wheal) and peripheral erythema (flare).

During initial allergen exposure, a patient predisposed to an allergic response will undergo
antibody class switching from IgM to IgE antibodies specific for the allergen. IgE produced by
B lymphocytes and plasma cells then binds to high-affinity IgE Fc receptors on basophils and
mast cells. Re-exposure to the allergen results in cross-linking of bound IgE antibodies with
subsequent degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, proteases
[tryptase], leukotrienes, prostaglandins). Localized vasodilation and increased vascular
permeability result in the characteristic wheal-and-flare lesions. In severe cases, widespread
release of these agents can also cause systemic vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and
massive fluid shifts, leading to anaphylactic shock and potentially death.

(Choice A) C3b, the larger subunit produced by cleavage of complement component 3, binds
to pathogens and enhances phagocytosis. The C3b component of immune complexes formed
by type III hypersensitivity reactions can also bind to CR1 receptors on erythrocytes, facilitating
their clearance in the liver and spleen.
