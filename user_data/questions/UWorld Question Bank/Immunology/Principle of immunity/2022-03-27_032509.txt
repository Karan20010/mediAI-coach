Opsonization occurs when host proteins such as immunoglobulins or complement bind to the
surface of foreign cells (eg, bacteria) to promote phagocytosis. The most important opsonins
(coating proteins) are immunoglobulin (lg) G and complement C3b, but mannose-binding
lectin and C-reactive protein can also opsonize cells. After opsonins are bound to the cell
surface, they act as a handle for receptors on phagocytes (eg, Fc receptors, C3b receptors) to
grasp, allowing the phagocytes to more easily engulf the foreign cell.

The importance of C3 is demonstrated by the fact that all 3 complement pathways (lectin,
classical, and alternative) converge on it, resulting in cleavage into C3a and C3b. C3a helps
recruit phagocytic cells and induce inflammation. C3b, in addition to acting as an opsonin, can
bind to C3b convertase and form C5 convertase, ultimately triggering the membrane attack
complex.

(Choice A) 5-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) is produced by a variety of immune cells
and serves as a leukotriene and lipoxin precursor. It also causes neutrophil and macrophage
chemotaxis and neutrophil degranulation.

(Choice C) Complement C5a can enhance phagocytosis by macrophages, but it does so by

binding to receptors on the phagocytes and stimulating them directly, not by coating the foreign

cells. It also is a potent chemotactic agent, drawing more neutrophils and monocytes to the
