reactions can develop hours to days after exposure to an antigen (eg, medications, transfused
red blood cells), resulting in destruction of erythrocytes (causing fatigue, pallor), platelets
(petechial bleeding), or leukocytes (fever, sepsis).

(Choice B) Immune complex-mediated complement activation causes tissue damage days to
weeks after initial antigen exposure in type III hypersensitivity reactions. Immune complexes
tend to deposit in the basement membrane of small blood vessels in the skin, kidneys, or
joints, resulting in vasculitis.

(Choice E) In delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity reactions, CD4- T cells release cytokines (eg,
interferon gamma) that promote T cell- and macrophage-mediated tissue damage. Although
these reactions can also present as an indurated skin lesion (eg, tuberculosis skin testing),
type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over days (rather than hours) because of the time
needed for cellular amplification.

Educational objective:

The late phase of dermatologic type | hypersensitivity reactions manifests as an indurated skin
lesion hours after exposure to the allergen due to local tissue damage caused by major basic
protein released from eosinophils. In contrast, type IV hypersensitivity reactions develop over
days because of the time needed to produce a cell-mediated immune response.
