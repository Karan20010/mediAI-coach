A 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to wheezing and difficulty

breathing. The patient had been trick-or-treating with his parents and ate several packs of

candy containing peanuts. After he receives an intramuscular epinephrine injection, his

symptoms resolve. At a follow up appointment, an allergy specialist places droplets of various

allergens on the patient's skin and punctures the epidermis at each site. After 15 minutes, the

skin at the site with peanut extract is erythematous with a raised, itchy bump that improves by

the time the family leaves the office. Four hours later, the parents notice a hard, red swelling

at the puncture site. Which of the following is most likely involved in this secondary reaction?

SY C. Epithelial damage by major basic protein (31%)

A. Cell lysis following IgG autoantibody binding (3%)
