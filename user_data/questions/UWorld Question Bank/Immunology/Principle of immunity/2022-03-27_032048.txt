B-cell precursors proliferate and mature in the bone marrow. Mature B-cells then leave the
bone marrow and migrate to lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues, where they are exposed
to antigens. On first exposure to a new antigen, a clone of B-cells becomes activated. Some
activated B-cells differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that release antigen-specific IgM
through a T-cell independent process. However, most activated B-cells migrate to lymphoid
follicles located in the lymph node cortex where they form germinal centers (arrows) that are
the site of B-cell proliferation during the immune response. A portion of these activated B-cells
form long-lived memory cells that remain dormant in the lymph node until the next encounter
with the same antigen, but the majority transform into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

Isotype switching (from IgM to other types of immunoglobulins) also occurs in the germinal

centers late in the primary response, providing activated B-cells the ability to produce antigen-
specific antibodies of differing isotypes. Heavy chain constant regions are isotype-specific and
distinguish the 5 isotypes (IgM, IgG, IgA, IgE, and IgD), while the variable regions are antigen-
specific. Light chains are antigen-specific and do not determine isotype. Isotype switching
first requires interaction of the CD40 receptor on activated B-cells with the CD40 ligand
(CD154) expressed by activated T-cells. Afterward, isotype switching can occur through
genetic rearrangement of the heavy chain constant regions. This process is modulated by T-
