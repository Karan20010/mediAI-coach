(Choices A and C) Antibody quality (ie, avidity for the target antigen) and levels of memory B
and T lymphocytes are preserved with age, allowing most aging individuals to mount an
effective immune response to previously encountered antigens.

(Choice D) Neutrophil-induced apoptosis is reduced in aging individuals, increasing
susceptibility for nonhealing wounds/infections. However, a change in neutrophil function
would not significantly impact the vaccine response.

(Choice E) Phagocytosis and antigen presentation by dendritic cells and macrophages
decline with age, further impairing the immune response to novel antigens.

Educational objective:

Immunosenescense is the normal age-related decline that impairs most aspects of immune
function, including the production of naive B and T cells. This results in a diminished antibody-
based immune response to novel antigens (eg, infections, vaccinations). The immune
response to previously experienced pathogens is typically intact due to normal or increased
levels of memory B and T cells and preserved antibody quality.
