Pharmacology researchers are developing a new antivenom to treat coral snakebites. They
immunize horses with snake venom, extract IgG-containing plasma, and then administer the
plasma to humans who have been bitten by a coral snake. This therapy neutralizes the venom
and improves the patient's symptoms. In order to produce venom-selective antibodies, the
researchers select a single venom-specific plasma cell from the immunized horse and induce it
to proliferate and produce large amounts of venom-specific IgG. However, they find that the
antibody produced by the single plasma cell is less effective at neutralizing the venom than the
IgG-containing plasma. A decrease in which of the following best explains the reduced
efficacy of the immunoglobulin produced by the single plasma cell?

A. Affinity of the individual immunoglobulin (21%)
B. Avidity of the individual immunoglobulin (19%)
YY  C.Number of antigen epitopes recognized (51%)

D. Valency of the individual immunoglobulin (6%)
