Most of the protection provided by vaccines depends on antibodies generated by an immune
response to pathogen-specific antigens. These antibodies can bind to the pathogen and
directly neutralize it or facilitate elimination of the pathogen through phagocytosis, complement
fixation, and/or antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. The risk of primary vaccine failure is

increased in patients with altered immune function, including those with atopic disorders (eg,

asthma, eczema), steroid use, or age-related immune decline (eg, immunosenescence).

The loss of telomere length during normal aging particularly affects rapidly dividing immune
cells (eg, bone marrow stem cells, lymphocyte precursors), resulting in decreased production
of naive B and T lymphocytes. Aging is also associated with chronic low-grade inflammation
that causes much of the remaining naive lymphocyte pool to differentiate into memory
lymphocytes against previously encountered antigens. These changes impair the adaptive
immune response to novel antigens (eg, pathogens, vaccinations) and predispose these
patients to vaccine failure and increased susceptibility to infection.

(Choices A and C) Antibody quality (ie, avidity for the target antigen) and levels of memory B
and T lymphocytes are preserved with age, allowing most aging individuals to mount an
effective immune response to previously encountered antigens.

(Choice D) Neutrophil-induced apoptosis is reduced in aging individuals, increasing
