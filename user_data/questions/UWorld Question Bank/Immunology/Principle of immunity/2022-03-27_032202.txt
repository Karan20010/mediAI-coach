Educational objective:

Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against CD20, a cell surface receptor on
developing and mature B cells. Binding of rituximab to CD20 results in B-cell cytotoxicity and
phagocytosis, which reduces the B-cell population. This reduces inflammatory symptoms in a

wide range of rheumatologic diseases.
