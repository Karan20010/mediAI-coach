Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) is caused by maternal anti-fetal
erythrocyte IgG antibodies, which can cross the placenta and produce a type II (antibody-
mediated) hypersensitivity response. With maternal blood types A or B, hemolysis (eg,
erythrocyte destruction) does not occur because the maternal antibodies (anti-A or anti-B) are
of the IgM type, which cannot cross the placenta. However, mothers with blood type O also

produce IgG antibodies which can cause hemolysis in the fetus.

The association of a fetus with blood type A or B and a mother with blood type O occurs in
approximately 15% of pregnancies; however, HDFN occurs in only 3% of these pregnancies
due to variations in fetal ABO antigen expression. Unlike Rh disease, HDFN can occur with
the first pregnancy because anti-A and anti-B antibodies are formed early in life from
exposure to A- or B-like antigens present in foods, bacteria, and viruses.

(Choice A) IgA plays an important role in mucosal immunity and is found in high amounts in
colostrum. The secretory IgA provided by the mother's breast milk coats the infant's intestinal

mucosa and provides protection from ingested pathogens.
(Choice B) IgD is an immunoglobulin of unclear significance. It is often concurrently

expressed with IgM on the membranes of B lymphocytes and is believed to act as a cell
surface antigen receptor for those cells.
