cell cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IFN-y. After the primary immune response,
subsequent encounters with the same antigen generate a predominantly IgG response (or IgA
in the case of a mucosal response).

(Choice B) Negative selection refers to the deletion of T-cell clones that strongly bind to self-
MHC antigens. This process occurs in the fetal thymus and contributes to the development of
tolerance to one's own antigens.

(Choice C) Tolerance is immunologic unresponsiveness to self antigens. Central tolerance is
acquired within the fetal thymus during negative selection. Peripheral tolerance develops by
means of T-cell anergy, which is the functional inactivation of T-cells that are reactive to self
antigens.

(Choices D and E) Recombination of the V, D, and J regions of heavy chains and the V and J
regions of light chains occurs via DNA rearrangement. After undergoing immunoglobulin gene
rearrangement, each B-cell makes antibodies of a single specificity. An enormous variety of
different immunoglobulin molecules can potentially be produced through rearrangement.
Recombination of these regions occurs during B-cell maturation within the bone marrow. Later
on, during the primary immune response, affinity maturation occurs in the germinal centers
through the process of somatic hypermutation.
