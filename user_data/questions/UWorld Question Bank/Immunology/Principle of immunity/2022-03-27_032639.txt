Pharmacology researchers develop a novel monoclonal antibody medication to treat the wet
form of age-related macular degeneration. The antibody binds vascular endothelial growth
factor, decreasing abnormal blood vessel formation in the subretinal space. In a clinical trial,
the medication is found to improve visual function. During the next phase of the study,
researchers use only the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of the antibody instead of the whole
immunoglobulin. Which of the following is most likely to be observed with use of the antibody
fragments compared to the intact immunoglobulin?

©) A. Decreased renal excretion of the drug

©) B. Greater tissue penetration of the drug

(©) C. Higher receptor-mediated uptake by macrophages
©) D. Increased complement-dependent cytotoxicity

©) E. Lower affinity for the target antigen
