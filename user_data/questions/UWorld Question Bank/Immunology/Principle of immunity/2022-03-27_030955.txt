el Pharmacology researchers are developing a new antivenom to treat coral snakebites. They

researchers select a single venom-specific plasma cell from the immunized horse and induce it
to proliferate and produce large amounts of venom-specific IgG. However, they find that the
antibody produced by the single plasma cell is less effective at neutralizing the venom than the
IgG-containing plasma. A decrease in which of the following best explains the reduced
efficacy of the immunoglobulin produced by the single plasma cell?

©) B. Avidity of the individual immunoglobulin

©) C. Number of antigen epitopes recognized

©) D. Valency of the individual immunoglobulin
