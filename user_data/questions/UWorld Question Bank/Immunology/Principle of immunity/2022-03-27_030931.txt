(Choice E) Mannose-binding lectin is a PRR that recognizes microbial carbohydrates and
activates the lectin complement pathway.

Educational objective:

Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are part of the innate immune response; they recognize
damaged host proteins or conserved microbial molecules and trigger inflammation. Toll-like
receptors, a type of PRR on macrophages and dendritic cells, recognize lipopolysaccharide
and promote the release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1/6/12, TNF-alpha) via NF-kB
signaling.
