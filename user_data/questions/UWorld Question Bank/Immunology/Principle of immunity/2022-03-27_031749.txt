However, the administration of multiple antivenom doses can overwhelm the phagocytic
system, leading to the aggregation of ICs in the bloodstream. Aggregated ICs then deposit in
tissue (eg, skin, joints), activate the complement cascade, and cause a type Ill
hypersensitivity reaction called serum sickness. Serum sickness generally presents with
fever, urticarial rash, and arthralgia 1-2 weeks after exposure to nonhuman proteins in
antivenom, antitoxins, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccinations. Most cases resolve
spontaneously over several days as the ICs are cleared.

(Choices A and D) Antivenom administration can cause IgE antibodies to form against the
nonhuman portions of the protein, which then triggers a type | hypersensitivity reaction upon
reexposure. Although these reactions often cause urticaria due to mast cell degranulation,
symptoms typically arise within seconds or minutes of reexposure, not a week or two after
initial exposure.

(Choice B) Superantigens directly activate polyclonal populations of T cells, leading to acute-
onset fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and organ failure. Fab fragments in antivenom
are unlikely to activate T cells directly; they are processed by antigen-presenting cells and lead
to the generation of antibodies.
