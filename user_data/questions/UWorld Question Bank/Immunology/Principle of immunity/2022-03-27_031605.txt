; Pus consists of a thin, protein-rich fluid, known as liquor puris, and dead leukocytes, primarily
- neutrophils. During infection, macrophages and surrounding endothelial cells release
7 cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8) that trigger neutrophils to enter the site of infection via
: chemotaxis. IL-8 also induces phagocytosis in neutrophils once they have arrived.
10 (Choice A) Bradykinin is a component of the kinin system. It causes vasodilation, increases
. = vascular permeability, stimulates nonvascular smooth muscle contraction, and mediates pain.

(Choice B) C3a is a component of the complement system. C3a, C4a, and C5a are
inflammatory anaphylatoxins that trigger histamine release from mast cells, resulting in
vasodilation and enhanced vascular permeability. C5a also recruits and activates neutrophils,
monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. In contrast, C3a recruits and activates eosinophils
and basophils, but not neutrophils.

(Choice C) IL-3 is a cytokine produced by activated T cells. It stimulates the growth and
differentiation of stem cells in the bone marrow.
(Choice E) IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by T,,2 cells and macrophages.

IL-10 limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, gamma interferon, IL-2, IL-3, and
TNF-a).
