A 75-year-old man is hospitalized due to respiratory distress. The patient developed fever,
cough, and muscle aches 4 days prior to admission. He is otherwise healthy and has no
chronic medical conditions. The patient has received all recommended vaccinations, including
a yearly flu vaccine. Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is 110/65 mm Hg, pulse is
115/min, and respirations are 29/min. Chest x-ray shows bilateral infiltrates. Reverse
transcriptase PCR of a specimen from a nasopharyngeal swab reveals a strain of influenza A
virus that was included in the seasonal trivalent flu vaccine. The patient lives with his 50-year-
old son, who received the same vaccine but did not develop the infection. Which of the
following factors most likely increased this patient's risk of vaccine failure compared with that

of his son?
