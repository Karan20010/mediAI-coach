not activate complement or trigger phagocytosis via the Fc receptor on macrophages

(Choices C and D). Therefore, Fab fragments generally are not used in applications that
require cell death (eg, cancer immunotherapy).

¢ Single-chain variable fragments (scFv) contain a light chain and heavy chain variable
region linked together by a peptide.

¢ Single-domain antibody (sdAb) has only a light chain variable region or a heavy chain

variable region.

(Choice A) Antibody fragments pass through the glomerular basement membrane into the
collecting system more easily than full immunoglobulins due to their small size; therefore,
antibody fragments typically are excreted more (not less) quickly.

(Choice E) Because the hypervariable region in a Fab fragment is the same as that in the full
immunoglobulin, the fragment and full immunoglobulin bind the antigen with an equivalent
affinity.

Educational objective:

Immunotherapy medications often utilize fragments of a monoclonal immunoglobulin rather
than the full immunoglobulin; because fragments are smaller, they typically have better tissue

penetration and pharmacokinetics. Fab fragments contain a variable domain and the first
