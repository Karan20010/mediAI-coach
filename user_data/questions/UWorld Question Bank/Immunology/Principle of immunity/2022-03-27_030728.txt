damage to venules can result in fluid extravasation through gaps between injured venule
endothelial cells. The result is a blister formed from a collection of serous fluid between the
dermis and epidermis (Choice A).

(Choices C and E) Platelets and neutrophils play an important role in healing after a thermal
burn by releasing prostaglandins, cytokines, and growth factors that stimulate increased blood
flow, inflammation, and tissue regrowth. Although both cells contribute to the erythema in and
around a burn wound, these changes occur hours to days after the burn rather than minutes
after, as in this patient.

(Choice D) Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is released by platelets, macrophages, and
endothelial cells and plays an important role in generating the vascular and fibroblast
proliferation needed for normal wound healing over the days to weeks following the initial
injury.

Educational objective:

The earliest morphologic change that occurs after a superficial thermal burn is erythema due
to the release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine) from mast cells. Deeper (eg, partial-
thickness) burn wounds form blisters due to fluid extravasation through gaps between

damaged venule endothelial cells.
