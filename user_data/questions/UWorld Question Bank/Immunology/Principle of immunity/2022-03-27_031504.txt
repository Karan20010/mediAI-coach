(Choice C) IgE is the immunoglobulin most notably responsible for atopic diseases such as
asthma, atopic dermatitis, and allergic rhinitis. It also plays a role in defense against helminth
parasites.

(Choice D) IgG crosses the placenta and remains circulating in the bloodstream of infants,
providing them with passive immunity for up to 6 months.

Educational objective:

With maternal blood types A or B, hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn very rarely
occurs because maternal antibodies (anti-A or anti-B) are of the IgM type and cannot cross the
placenta. In contrast, mothers with blood type O also produce IgG antibodies (anti-A and anti-
B), which can cross the placenta and cause fetal hemolysis.
