Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), an encapsulated gram-negative coccobacillus,

was previously a common, invasive, and potentially fatal cause of pneumonia, epiglottitis, and
meningitis in children. Neonates are protected with maternal anti-Hib IgG antibodies from
placental transfer in utero, but this protection wanes as the immunoglobulins are degraded
during the first few months of life. Therefore, widespread vaccination with the Hib
polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine series is recommended starting at age 2 months;
this practice has dramatically reduced the incidence of Hib infection.

Bacteria with polysaccharide capsules (eg, Hib, Streptococcus pneumoniae [pneumococcus],
Neisseria meningitidis) are antiphagocytic. The polysaccharide capsule provokes an
antibody-mediated (B cell) immune response and is the primary antigenic constituent of
vaccines against encapsulated bacteria. However, vaccines containing the polysaccharide
antigen alone are ineffective in children age <2 years due to their immature humoral immunity.
Therefore, the polysaccharide is conjugated with a carrier protein to amplify the patient's
humoral response against the polysaccharide through T cell recruitment. The Hib conjugate
vaccine contains a carrier protein that is derived from either a tetanus toxoid (TT) protein or an
outer membrane protein (OMP) of Neisseria meningitidis. The polysaccharide-protein
conjugate then becomes aT cell-dependent antigen. Immunogenicity is increased as a
