Oncogenesis generates proteins not found in healthy cells. Pieces of these proteins
(neoantigens) are displayed on the cell surface and may be recognized by cytotoxic T-cells as
"non-self" (leading to cellular apoptosis). However, neoplastic cells can blunt the cytotoxic T-
cell response through a variety of mechanisms including the overexpression of programmed
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and inhibits their
ability to induce apoptosis (T-cell exhaustion).

Treatment with monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 (eg, pembrolizumab, nivolumab) or PD-
L1 (eg, atezolizumab) results in T-cell disinhibition and a restoration of the cytotoxic response
(thereby increasing cancer cell apoptosis). Anti-PD-1 therapy is currently used in advanced
melanoma, certain types of lung cancer, and renal cell carcinoma but is being explored for

many other cancer types.

(Choices A and B) HIV uses chemokine coreceptor 5 (CCRS5) to bind to CD4 cells.
Antagonists to CCR5 have been developed for the management of patients with HIV. CCRS
also appears to promote CD4 cell anti-tumor responses, so antibodies blocking its function
may downregulate immune-mediated tumor destruction. Blockade of CD4 itself would inhibit
helper T-cell activation and reduce tumor cell destruction.
