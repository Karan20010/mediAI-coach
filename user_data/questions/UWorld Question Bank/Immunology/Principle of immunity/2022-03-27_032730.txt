Educational objective:

Immunotherapy medications often utilize fragments of a monoclonal immunoglobulin rather
than the full immunoglobulin; because fragments are smaller, they typically have better tissue
penetration and pharmacokinetics. Fab fragments contain a variable domain and the first
constant region from a heavy and light chain; because they do not contain an Fc receptor, Fab
fragments cannot trigger cell killing via complement or phagocytosis.
