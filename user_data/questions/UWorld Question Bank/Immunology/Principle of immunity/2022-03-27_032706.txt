Immunoglobulins (antibodies) are the principal component of the humoral immune system.

They are effector proteins that bind to specific epitopes of antigens based on the unique

group of 110-130 amino acids present in the hypervariable region of the immunoglobulin light

and heavy chain. Because individual immunoglobulins can identify molecular targets with a

high degree of specificity, immunoglobulin therapy (immunotherapy) has been developed to

target specific ligands, cytokines, receptors, growth factors, and other proteins that contribute

to the pathogenesis or progression of inflammatory and neoplastic conditions.

Immunotherapy is monoclonal because all the immunoglobulin components in the medication
have the same hypervariable region (produced from the same B-cell clone). However, most
immunotherapy regimens use a fragment of the immunoglobulin with 1 valence (binding) site
rather than the full immunoglobulin with 2 valence sites, because fragments are significantly
smaller than the full immunoglobulin, which improves tissue/tumor penetration and
medication pharmacokinetics.

Common types of immunoglobulin fragments include the following:

¢ Antigen binding fragments (Fab) contain a variable domain and the first constant region
of a heavy and light chain. Because Fab fragments do not contain an Fc region, they do

not activate complement or trigger phagocytosis via the Fc receptor on macrophages
