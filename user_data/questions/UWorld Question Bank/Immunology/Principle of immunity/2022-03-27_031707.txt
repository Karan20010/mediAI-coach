(Choice F) Leukotriene C, (and its relatives, leukotriene D, and E,) triggers intense
vasoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and bronchospasm. Leukotriene By and the
leukotriene precursor 5-HETE stimulate neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation (but not
leukotriene Cz).

Educational objective:

Interleukin-8 is a chemokine produced by macrophages that induces chemotaxis and
phagocytosis in neutrophils. Other significant chemotactic agents include leukotriene B,, 5-

HETE (the leukotriene precursor), and complement component C5a.
