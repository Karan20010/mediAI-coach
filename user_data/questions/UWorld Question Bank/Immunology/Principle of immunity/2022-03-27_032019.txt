Educational objective:

The binding of autoantibodies to host antigens can trigger the classical complement cascade,
leading to low C4 and C3 levels. Because autoantibodies do not activate the alternative
complement cascade, factor B levels remain normal. This pattern is frequently seen in
rheumatologic diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
