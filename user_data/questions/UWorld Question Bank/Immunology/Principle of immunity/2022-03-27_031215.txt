Interactions between multiple receptors and ligands are generally required to activate effector
cells of the adaptive immune response. This redundancy slows immune cell activation and
prevents development of autoimmunity. CD40 ligand (CD40L), a transmembrane protein on
the surface of activated CD4 T cells, is the most important costimulatory signal for antigen-

presenting cells (APCs) as follows:

Â¢ BCells: Binding of CD40L to CD40 on B cells promotes the formation of germinal
centers, somatic hypermutation (increased antigen-binding specificity), and
immunoglobulin class switching (secretion of IgG/IgA/IgE instead of IgM). These actions
significantly enhance the humoral immune response by generating the full range of
effector immunoglobulins.

Macrophages and dendritic cells: Binding of CD40L to CD40 causes the APC to

produce proinflammatory cytokines, express T-cell costimulatory signals (eg, CD80/86),
increase phagocytosis, and increase major histocompatibility complex class II surface

expression. These changes promote the activation of additional CD4 T lymphocytes,
which are critical for mounting a potent cell-mediated immune response.

Because CD4OL is required for B-cells to undergo class-switching, mutations to CD40L

generally cause B cells to overproduce IgM and dramatically underproduce other
