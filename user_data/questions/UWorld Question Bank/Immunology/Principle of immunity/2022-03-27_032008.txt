The most common cause of complement deficiency is autoantibodies, which activate the
classical complement system after binding host antigens. Classical complement pathway
activation is marked by low C4 and C3 levels and normal factor B levels; CH50, a measure
of functional activity of the entire classical pathway (eg, sufficient C1-C9), will also be low.
This pattern is common in systemic lupus erythematosus, particularly in the setting of active
renal, skin, and joint disease.

(Choice A) The Fc portions of IgA, IgE, and IgD cannot activate the complement system.
Therefore, IgA-antigen binding does not reduce C3 and C4 levels.

(Choice B) Autoactivation of C3b triggers the alternative complement pathway, which is
marked by normal C4, low C3, and low factor B levels; AH50, a measure of functional activity
of the alternative pathway, will also be low.

(Choice C) C1 inhibitors remove Cir/s from the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (classical
pathway) and block the activation of C2/C4 by lectin pattern recognition receptors (lectin
pathway). Therefore, C1 inhibitors prevent activation of the complement cascade and

increase (not decrease) complement levels.

(Choice D) The complement cascade culminates with the generation of a membrane attack

complex using C9 multimers in combination with C5-C8, leading to cell lysis.
