(Choice B) Isotype switching is a process that occurs in naive B-lymphocytes upon initial
exposure to antigen; this process does not occur in T-lymphocyte maturation.

(Choice E) TCR DNA rearrangement is an exceedingly complex process that results in
excess of 10" different possible antigen binding sites. The process is similar to that of
immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in that it involves joining of V, D, J and C regions of the
TCR gene and the processes of junctional flexibility, N and P-region nucleotide addition,
alternative joining of genes, and multiple peptides combining to form the intact receptor. The
mature TCR is formed from joining of an a and a b protein segment, and these proteins are
membrane-bound in close association with either CD4 or CD8 as well as the costimulatory
CD28 and CD45.

Educational Objective:

The process of negative selection in T cell maturation is essential for eliminating T cells that
bind to self MHC or self antigens with overly high affinity. This process occurs in the thymic
medulla. If these cells were permitted to survive, they would likely induce immune and
inflammatory reactions against self antigens leading to autoimmune disease.
