(Choice D) Leukotriene B4 is a metabolite of arachidonic acid. Its main function is to
stimulate neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation.

(Choice E) Transforming growth factor-beta is released by macrophages and has anti-
inflammatory roles in sepsis, including suppressing the release of IL-1 and TNF-a, and
inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation.

Educational objective:

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is released from activated macrophages and is one of the most
important mediators of the systemic inflammatory response in sepsis. Other cytokines
responsible for inducing the systemic inflammatory response include IL-1 and IL-6.
