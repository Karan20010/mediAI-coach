(Choice C) Muromonab is a monoclonal antibody sometimes used to prevent organ
transplant rejection. It binds to CD3 receptors on T cells to trigger apoptosis, reducing T-
lymphocyte count and IL-2 activity. There is no direct effect on B lymphocytes, but B
lymphocyte activity is reduced due to decreased activation by T lymphocytes.

(Choices D and E) Azathioprine reduces the quantity and activity of both B and T
lymphocytes. Immunoglobulin levels are usually directly related to B-lymphocyte count, and
IL-2 activity is usually directly related to T-lymphocyte count; that is, if lymphocyte counts are
low, immunoglobin levels and IL-2 activity are also low.

Educational objective:

Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug that inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis and
incorporates false purine nucleotides into DNA and RNA. These effects reduce the
proliferation and activity of both B and T lymphocytes.
