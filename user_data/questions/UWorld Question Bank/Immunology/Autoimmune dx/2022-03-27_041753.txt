Glucocorticoids also impair neutrophil margination, extravasation, and migration to

inflammatory sites by reducing adhesion molecule expression on neutrophils (eg, L selectin)

and endothelial cells and limiting production of cytokines (eg, IL-8) that promote neutrophil

emigration. The result is increased circulating levels of neutrophils (ie, neutrophilia).

In addition to these changes, glucocorticoids have a variety of other effects on immune

function, as follows:

Educational objective:

Increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10) (Choice A)
Decreased apoptosis of neutrophils, reinforcing neutrophilia (Choice C)

Promoting apoptosis of eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes, decreasing circulating
levels

Reduced macrophage activation (decreasing overall 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
synthesis) (Choice E)

Decreased production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes through the inhibition of
phospholipase A2 (Choice F)
