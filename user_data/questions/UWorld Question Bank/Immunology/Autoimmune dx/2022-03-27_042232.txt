FOXP3 encodes a transcriptional regulator that converts activated CD4 cells into regulatory T
cells (Treg), a population of T lymphocytes that inhibit immune activation. Expression of
FOXP3 drives the production of the following inhibitory cytokines and surface ligands:

¢ IL-10 inhibits macrophage function, blocks inflammatory cytokine release by CD4+ T cells,
and downregulates expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on

+B
THT

antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

¢ Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-B) inhibits B-lymphocyte proliferation/activation
and promotes Treg differentiation (eg, FOXP3 expression).

¢ Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) binds with high affinity to CD80/86 on
APCs, a surface protein required for costimulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; because
CTLA-4 binds up CD80/86, less is available for the activation of T cells.

Mutations in FOXP3 lead to excessive and unregulated T- and B-lymphocyte activity and is
associated with a rare genetic disorder called IPEX (Immune dysregulation,
Polyendocrinopathy, Enteropathy, and X-linked transmission); it is marked by autoimmune
enteritis (eg, lymphocytic infiltrate, villous atrophy, chronic diarrhea), eczematous dermatitis,

and type 1 diabetes in infancy.
