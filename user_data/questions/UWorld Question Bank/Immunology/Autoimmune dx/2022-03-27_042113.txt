(Choice C) Increased serum IgE levels are typically found in atopic individuals prone to IgE-
mediated (type |) hypersensitivity reactions. Type | reactions cause vasodilation and tissue
edema and inflammatory infiltration; they do not cause vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis.

(Choice D) Deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes is involved in the pathogenesis
of Henoch-Schénlein purpura in pediatric patients. IgA does not play an important role in type
Ill hypersensitivity.

(Choice E) Serum sickness causes release of the C5a complement fragment (a neutrophil
chemoattractant) at sites of immune complex deposition. This leads to neutropenia (not
neutrophilia) due to extensive neutrophilic marginalization and tissue infiltration. In addition,
infliximab and other TNF-alpha inhibitors can also cause neutropenia.

(Choice F) Mild thrombocytopenia has been associated with serum sickness due to platelet
consumption at the site of active vascular inflammation. However, severe thrombocytopenia is
unlikely to occur.

Educational objective:
Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction to nonhuman proteins characterized by
vasculitis resulting from tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes. Clinical findings
