Sjogren syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder that is most common in middle-age
women and is characterized by inflammation of exocrine glands (eg, salivary, lacrimal,
vaginal). It can occur as an isolated disorder or in association with another autoimmune
syndrome (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Patients typically have severe dry mouth (xerostomia)
due to insufficient saliva production.

Saliva has numerous antibacterial and antifungal proteins, along with organic and inorganic
components which protect tooth enamel. Patients with SS have a higher rate of thrush, dental
caries, and other complications of odontogenic infections (eg, osteomyelitis of the mandible)
because of the loss of these protective factors in saliva.

Reduction in tear production from the lacrimal glands can cause corneal dryness and damage,
and loss of vaginal lubrication in female patients is associated with dyspareunia (painful
intercourse) and frequent infections (eg, candidal, bacterial). Biopsy of the salivary glands is
diagnostic and shows a lymphocytic infiltrate, often with germinal centers.

(Choice A) Acromegaly is characterized by overproduction of growth hormone, typically due
to a somatotroph pituitary adenoma. Cranial effects include enlarged facial features,
prognathism, and increased spacing between the teeth.
