Azathioprine is an immunosuppression drug sometimes used in the treatment of autoimmune
disease (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) and the prevention of organ transplant rejection. It
generates 6-thioguanine metabolites that both inhibit an early step in de novo purine
synthesis and act as false purine nucleotides that disrupt DNA and RNA replication. These
effects are nonspecific and affect the proliferation of all rapidly dividing cells, including
hematopoietic cells. Therefore, there is reduced proliferation of both B and T
lymphocytes. The reduced number of activated T lymphocytes leads to reduced activity of
IL-2, and the reduced number of activated B lymphocytes leads to reduced immunoglobulin

levels.

Common adverse effects of azathioprine include pancytopenia (ie, anemia, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia) and increased susceptibility to infection.

(Choice A) Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody sometimes used to treat autoimmune disease
and hematologic malignancy. It binds to CD20 receptors on B lymphocytes, resulting

in apoptosis; the B lymphocyte count and immunoglobulin levels are reduced, but there is
minimal effect on T lymphocytes.

(Choice C) Muromonab is a monoclonal antibody sometimes used to prevent organ
transplant rejection. It binds to CD3 receptors on T cells to trigger apoptosis, reducing T-
