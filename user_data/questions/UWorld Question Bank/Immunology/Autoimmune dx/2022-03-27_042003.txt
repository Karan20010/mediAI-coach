arthritis, which often manifest with low back pain and joint stiffness that is worse at night.
Constitutional symptoms (eg, low-grade fever, fatigue), malabsorption, and weight loss are

also common.

The terminal ileum is frequently involved in Crohn disease. Bile acids, which are necessary
for the absorption of fat and other nutrients, are normally reabsorbed in the terminal ileum,
recycled in the liver, and then reused in the absorptive process. When the terminal ileum is
inflamed or resected, bile acids are lost with feces. Loss of bile acids causes fat
malabsorption, which may lead to deficiencies in fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).

Vitamin K is a cofactor for several carboxylase enzymes that are necessary for coagulation
factor Il, VII, IX, and X activation. Coagulation disorders such as vitamin K deficiency
typically result in easy bruising, large hematoma formation in deep tissues and joints (eg,
