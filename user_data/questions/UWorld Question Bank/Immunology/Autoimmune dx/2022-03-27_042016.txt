hemarthrosis) after minor trauma, and prolonged bleeding after surgery.

(Choice A) Autoimmune hepatitis is more common in women than in men and is more often
associated with ulcerative colitis than Crohn disease. Patients may be asymptomatic or
present with signs of liver dysfunction (eg, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites), including
easy bruising and gastrointestinal bleeding due to coagulopathy.

(Choice C) Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) is an X-linked recessive coagulation disorder
that can manifest as early as birth. Typical features include easy bruising, hemarthrosis, and
prolonged bleeding after surgery (eg, tooth extraction).

(Choice D) Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is characterized by autoimmune destruction of
platelets and is often associated with viral infections. Platelet abnormalities typically cause
superficial microhemorrhages such as petechiae and mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis, gingival
bleeding).

(Choice E) Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be associated with antibiotic use (eg, penicillins,
cephalosporins) or viral hepatitis infection; however, patients usually develop nonblanching
petechiae or palpable purpura without significant bleeding.
