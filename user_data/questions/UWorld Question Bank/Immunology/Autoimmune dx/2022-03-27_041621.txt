5 This patient has chronic right lower abdominal pain with tenderness and intermittent diarrhea,

6 symptoms that raise suspicion for Crohn disease with ongoing active inflammation. Patients

8 with mild Crohn disease (eg, limited area of inflammation, no evidence of systemic

9

involvement) are often treated with a targeted-release glucocorticoid such as budesonide to
reduce inflammation and induce disease remission.

Glucocorticoids, like many other lipid-derived hormones (eg, progesterone, estrogen), bind to
a cytosolic receptor rather than a cell surface receptor. The glucocorticoid-receptor complex
can then translocate into the nucleus, bind to the relevant DNA regions, and cause a tissue-
specific alteration in transcription. In immune cells, the effects of glucocorticoids include
inhibition of proinflammatory transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB),
which results in reduced expression of cytokines and inflammatory mediators (eg, TNF-alpha)
along with decreased immune cell survival and propagation.

Oral budesonide (often given in a delayed-release preparation that targets the ileum) is
especially useful in Crohn disease because it has high topical potency and less systemic
adverse effects than other glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) due to high first-pass
metabolism.
