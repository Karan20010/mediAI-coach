This patient has a purpuric rash, arthralgia, and signs of renal disease (ie, hypertension,
proteinuria), which are classic features of Henoch-Sch√©nlein purpura (HSP), or IgA
vasculitis. Other common findings can include colicky abdominal pain and hematuria.

HSP is an immune-mediated type III hypersensitivity reaction in which deposition of IgA
immune complexes (which may form in response to a preceding upper respiratory infection)
triggers complement activation and inflammation of small vessels throughout the body.
Vasculitis within the papillary dermis manifests as nonthrombocytopenic palpable purpura on
dependent areas, such as the buttocks and lower extremities. Histopathology shows
leukocytoclastic vasculitis, in which small superficial blood vessels are damaged by
perivascular neutrophilic inflammation, resulting in fibrin deposition in the vessel wall (ie,
fibrinoid necrosis) and red blood cell extravasation. Neutrophil breakdown (leukocytoclasis)
leads to the formation of perivascular nuclear debris. Immunofluorescence reveals IgA and C3
in the vessel walls.

HSP is usually benign and self-limiting, particularly in children. However, adults are at
increased risk for renal complications, such as nephrotic syndrome and acute kidney injury.
