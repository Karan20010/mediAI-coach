(Choice A) Disseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by abundant
intravascular fibrin deposition (ie, fibrin thrombi) in the absence of vascular inflammation. It
occurs most often in the setting of trauma, sepsis, or malignancy and presents with bleeding
(eg, purpura) due to thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy. Although fibrin thrombi may be
seen with HSP, extensive inflammatory infiltrate is also present.

(Choice B) Obliterative endarteritis with lymphocytes and plasma cells is seen with later-
stage syphilis, which can cause arthralgias, renal abnormalities, and a rash; however, classic
skin findings include scaly red/brown macules or papules that are typically diffuse and involve
the palms and soles. In contrast, this patient has purpuric lesions localized to the lower
extremities.

(Choice C) Perivascular necrotizing granulomas with eosinophilic infiltration are characteristic
of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), a small- to
medium-vessel vasculitis. It can cause renal, skin, and joint involvement later in life (eg, third
to fourth decades) but initially presents with asthma symptoms, which are not seen in this
patient.

(Choice E) Transmural granulomatous inflammation with fragmentation of elastic fibers is a

typical finding of giant cell arteritis, seen in adults age >50. It involves medium/large arteries
