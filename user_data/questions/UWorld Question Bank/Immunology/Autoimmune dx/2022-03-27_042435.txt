(Choice B) Eosinophil counts decrease significantly with administration of corticosteroids (an
effect previously used as the basis for a bioassay for corticosteroids). These drugs are used in
allergic conditions as they reduce the eosinophil count and therefore the release of mediators

from the eosinophils.

(Choice C) Corticosteroids reduce peripheral lymphocyte counts within minutes as a result of
inhibition of immunoglobulin synthesis, stimulation of lymphocyte apoptosis, and lymphocyte
redistribution (from the intravascular compartment to the spleen, lymph nodes, and bone
marrow). T lymphocyte counts are typically reduced to a greater degree than B lymphocyte

counts.

(Choice D) Corticosteroids inhibit peripheral extravasation of monocytes and macrophages
and decrease antigen presentation by macrophages and dendritic cells. Blood monocyte
levels drop after corticosteroid administration due to redistribution to lymphoid tissues.

Educational objective:

The acute effects of corticosteroids on the white blood cell count include an increased
neutrophil count and decreased lymphocyte, monocyte, basophil, and eosinophil counts. The
increase in the neutrophil count results from "demargination" of neutrophils previously attached
to the vessel wall.
