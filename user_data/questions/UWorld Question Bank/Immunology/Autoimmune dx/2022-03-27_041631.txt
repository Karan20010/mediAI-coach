(Choices A and E) Azathioprine and mycophenolate can be used to reduce inflammation in
patients with moderate-severe Crohn disease by inhibition of de novo purine synthesis, which
immune cells (eg, B and T cells) are especially dependent on during proliferation. Both agents
inhibit key enzymes in the purine synthesis pathway (which occurs in the cytosol) rather than

inhibiting transcription factors.

(Choice C) Although infliximab can be used to induce remission in patients with moderate-
severe Crohn disease, it is a monoclonal antibody that reduces inflammation by binding to and
inhibiting the proinflammatory effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a cytokine
that is primarily found extracellularly.

(Choice D) Methotrexate and its breakdown products are folic acid analogues that can reduce
inflammation by competitively inhibiting multiple folate-dependent enzymes rather than
inhibiting transcription factors.

Educational objective:

Budesonide, like other glucocorticoids, reduces inflammation by binding to a cytosolic receptor,
translocating into the nucleus, and inhibiting proinflammatory transcription factors such as
nuclear factor-kappa-B (NF-kB). It is especially useful in reducing transmural bowel

inflammation in patients with Crohn disease because it has high topical potency and limited
