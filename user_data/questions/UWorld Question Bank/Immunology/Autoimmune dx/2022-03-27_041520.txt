facilitate secondary microbial infections that complicate atopic dermatitis

(Choice B) IL-8 and C3b are involved in neutrophil migration and activation in bacterial
infections. IL-8 attracts neutrophils to infected areas, whereas C3b opsonizes pathogens for
phagocytosis. This patient has no sign of infection (eg, cellulitis), such as tenderness, fever, or
drainage.

(Choice C) |L-12 and interferon-gamma are involved in granuloma formation and host
defense against mycobacterial infections (eg, enhanced intracellular killing of tuberculosis in
phagolysosomes).

(Choice D) !L-17 and IL-23 are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis
typically presents as pruritic, erythematous plaques with thick, silvery scales, which are not
seen in this patient. In addition, its classic distribution involves the extensor, not flexor,
surfaces of elbows and knees.

(Choice E) TNF-alpha and IL-1 are involved in the pathogenesis of septic shock. Endotoxins
in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria induce the release of endogenous pyrogen
(eg, IL-1, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, TNF-alpha), leading to fever,
hypotension, increased vascular permeability, and organ failure.
