A 32-year-old man comes to the clinic for follow-up due to Crohn disease. The patient was
initially diagnosed 3 years ago and achieved disease remission following a course of high-

dose glucocorticoids. He remained in remission until 2 months ago, when he experienced an

acute flare of diarrhea and abdominal pain that required a brief hospitalization and another

course of high-dose glucocorticoids. The patient completed a prescribed glucocorticoid taper

earlier this week and says that his symptoms have returned to "about normal." Azathioprine

maintenance therapy is started to help prevent future flares. Which of the following most

accurately describes the expected effects of this new medication on immune function?
