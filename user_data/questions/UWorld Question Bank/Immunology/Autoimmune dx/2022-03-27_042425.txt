musculoskeletal; Phos = phosphate.

As a result of their immunosuppressive effects, corticosteroids such as prednisone have
been used to treat many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, including systemic lupus
erythematous. However, corticosteroid use can lead to a number of adverse effects. High
doses can sometimes cause corticosteroid-induced psychosis (confusion, hallucinations),
as seen in this patient; hypoalbuminemia is a risk factor, and the neuropsychiatric symptoms

typically resolve with discontinuation of therapy.

Corticosteroid receptors also have widespread physiologic effects, including those on
circulating leukocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Neutrophil counts increase following
administration of the drug as a result of "demargination” of neutrophils previously attached to
the vessel wall. Therefore, neutrophil recruitment to fight infection in tissues is decreased,

potentially contributing to increased infection risk.

(Choice A) Corticosteroids reduce basophil count, which decreases local inflammatory
responses by preventing histamine release.
