proliferation of activated lymphocytes. Because most other cells have an alternative pathway
for purine synthesis that lymphocytes lack, mycophenolate is relatively specific for suppression
of B and T cells.

to

(Choice C) Prednisone and other glucocorticoids bind to cytoplasmic receptors, translocate to
the nucleus, and then inhibit the transcription of genes that encode IL-2 and other
inflammatory mediators.

(Choice D) Rituximab is a chimeric antibody directed against the CD20 antigen (specific to B
lymphocytes). It depletes B cells (and reduces antibody production) through multiple
pathways, including complement-mediated lysis, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (via natural
killer cells), and induction of lymphocyte apoptosis.

Educational objective:

Sirolimus binds to the immunophilin FK binding protein (FKBP) in the cytoplasm, forming a
complex that binds and inhibits mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). Inhibition of MTOR
signaling blocks IL-2 signal transduction and prevents cell cycle progression and lymphocyte
proliferation.
