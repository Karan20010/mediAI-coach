Interferon-gamma (IFN-y) activates macrophages, increases major histocompatibility
complex expression, and promotes T helper 1 lymphocyte (Th1) differentiation. It is produced
primarily by activated T lymphocytes and natural killer cells and is critical in immunity against
viral and intracellular bacterial infections. IFN-y release assays (IGRAs) test for latent
tuberculosis infection (LTBI) by measuring the response of T lymphocytes when exposed to
antigens unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Similar to tuberculin skin tests (eg, purified
protein derivative), IGRAs measure cell-mediated immunity.

IGRAs have comparable sensitivity and specificity to tuberculin skin tests, but advantages
include their lack of cross-reactivity to the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine and that a
follow-up visit is not required. Neither skin tests nor IGRAs can be used to distinguish active
tuberculosis from LTBI.

(Choice A) B lymphocytes are the main cell type involved in the humoral immune system and
the production of circulating antibodies.

(Choices B and D) Basophils and antigen-presenting cells such as monocyte-derived
macrophages interact with T cells to control the immune response but are not directly
