¢ Acute rejection normally occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is typically caused
by a cell-mediated immune response to donor human leukocyte antigens. Histology

generally shows perivascular mononuclear infiltrates in the small blood vessels of the lung,

which can expand to include the alveolar walls (Choices A and E).

(Choice B) Bronchiolitis obliterans can occasionally cause large airway scarring, leading to
bronchiectasis, but this is not the primary pathologic manifestation.

(Choice C) Restrictive allograft syndrome, a less common type of chronic lung transplant
rejection, can result in fibrotic changes to the pleurae. However, pulmonary function tests
would reveal a restrictive (reduced FVC), not obstructive, pattern.

Educational objective:

Chronic lung transplant rejection is due primarily to progressive scarring of the small airways,
leading to bronchiolitis obliterans. Manifestations occur months or years after transplantation
and include obstructive lung disease (eg, reduced FEV1) with dyspnea and dry cough.
