(Choice D) T cells primarily reside in the lymph node paracortex. Paracortical hyperplasia is
typically seen with infections primarily dependent on the cell-mediated response (eq, viral
infection). Although the paracortical region might expand slightly in bacterial infections,
lymphadenopathy is primarily driven by the formation of germinal centers.

Educational objective:

Germinal centers are the sites where activated B cells proliferate and undergo affinity
maturation during generation of a humoral immune response. The formation of multiple
germinal centers is typically marked by lymphadenopathy, pain, and inflammation in the
affected lymph node due to cellular recruitment and the release of inflammatory cytokines.
