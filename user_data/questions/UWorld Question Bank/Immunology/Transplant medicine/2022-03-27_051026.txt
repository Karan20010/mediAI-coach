significantly affected as the donor T cells perceive the liver as self.

(Choices C and D) Acute and chronic graft rejections occur following host T and B cell

yi

sensitization against graft MHC antigens. The resulting immune response leads to graft failure
without significant involvement of other organ systems. This patient's skin and Gl findings
make GVHD more likely.

(Choice E) If the tissue recipient has antibodies against donor ABO antigens, hyperacute
rejection will develop within minutes of transplantation. Spasm and occlusion of graft vessels
occur, leading to ischemia and necrosis.

Educational objective:

Graft-versus-host disease can occur following transplantation of organs rich in lymphocytes
(eg, liver). T lymphocytes found in the donor organ become sensitized against the MHC
antigens of the recipient and subsequently attack the host's tissues. The skin, liver, and
gastrointestinal tract are most frequently affected.
