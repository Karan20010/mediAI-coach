Although patients who undergo organ transplantation receive immunosuppressive therapy,
rejection reactions still commonly occur. The severity and timing of the rejection depends on

the degree of difference between the donor and recipient major histocompatibility complex

i

antigens in addition to other variables.

Chronic lung transplant rejection is marked by submucosal lymphocytic inflammation in the
walls of the small airways. Subsequent ingrowth of granulation tissue into the lumen leads to
airway obstruction and obliteration (bronchiolitis obliterans). Patients usually present with
slowly worsening dyspnea and dry cough that begins months or years after
transplantation. Lung examination may reveal end-expiratory squeaks or pops, and
spirometry typically demonstrates airflow limitation (obstructive pattern) with a drop in FEV1.

Other forms of lung transplant rejection include:

¢ Hyperacute rejection usually occurs on the first day of transplantation and is caused by
preformed host antibodies against donor ABO or human leukocyte antigens (major
histocompatibility complexes). Histology generally shows fibrinoid necrosis with
hemorrhage and ischemia ("white graft" reaction).

¢ Acute rejection normally occurs within 6 months of transplantation and is typically caused

by a cell-mediated immune response to donor human leukocyte antigens. Histology
