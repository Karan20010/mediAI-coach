This patient sustained a puncture wound and subsequently developed inflammatory
lymphadenopathy in a draining lymph node, suggesting bacterial infection with
lymphadenitis. Lymph nodes serve as sentinel sites for generation of the adaptive immune
response. Large, unprocessed foreign antigens are displayed by follicular dendritic cells in
the draining lymph node. B cells recognize, bind to, and process the large antigens into
smaller peptides that can be displayed on major histocompatibility II receptors to naive T cells.
T cells subsequently differentiate into T-helper cells and secrete cytokines that promote the
survival and proliferation of the antigen-specific B cells, leading to the generation of germinal
centers.

Germinal centers are the sites where B cells compete for survival based upon the ability to
bind with high affinity to a foreign antigen. Within these regions, B cells rapidly proliferate and
undergo somatic hypermutation (immunoglobulin mutation); this dramatically expands the B
cell population capable of binding with high affinity to antigens from the infecting
microorganism. Antigen-specific B cells eventually evolve into plasma cells that secrete high
affinity antibodies against the invading pathogen.

Because the formation of germinal centers results in significant cellular recruitment, patients
generally develop lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) in the draining lymph node. In
