This patient with impaired renal function within the first few weeks following renal transplant
likely has acute rejection. This process is mostly cell-mediated and results from
sensitization of recipient T cells to donor graft MHC antigens (human leukocyte antigens).
Humoral (antibody-mediated) immunity may also be involved in acute rejection, but it typically
plays a smaller role.

Acute rejection usually occurs within the first 6 months following transplantation. Patients
often have an asymptomatic rise in serum creatinine, but they may also have low-grade fever,
malaise, joint pains, and graft tenderness. Histology reveals a dense lymphocytic infiltrate
sometimes accompanied by vascular inflammation. Acute rejection is typically reversible and
usually treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. Chronic immunosuppression with a calcineurin
inhibitor—-based regimen (eg, tacrolimus plus mycophenolate and low-dose prednisone) helps
prevent acute rejection episodes.

(Choices A and B) Graft versus host disease (GVHD) primarily involves activation of donor T
cells within grafted tissue against recipient (host) antigens. B cells are also involved to a
lesser extent. GVHD typically occurs only when the recipient lacks a competent immune
response (eg, in the setting of bone marrow transplant).
