Unless a transplanted kidney is obtained from a genetically identical donor (eg, identical twin),
chronic immunosuppression therapy is needed to help prevent organ rejection. Sirolimus
is commonly used as part of the immunosuppression regimen for solid organ transplants. It
functions as a proliferation signal inhibitor by targeting the mTOR (mammalian target of
rapamycin) signaling pathway, an important stimulator of cell growth and proliferation.
Specifically, sirolimus binds to the immunophilin FK binding protein (FKBP), forming a complex
that inhibits mTOR. This leads to interruption of IL-2 signal transduction, preventing G1 to
S phase progression and lymphocyte proliferation.

Calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, cyclosporine) are other commonly used
immunosuppression medications that function by blocking the translocation of nuclear factor of
activated T-cells (NFAT), resulting in reduced transcription of IL-2.

(Choice A) Bortezomib binds and inhibits the 26S proteasome. In multiple myeloma,
bortezomib can facilitate apoptosis of neoplastic cells by preventing degradation of
proapoptotic factors.

(Choice B) Mycophenolate reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. This
blocks a critical step in the de novo synthesis of purine nucleotides that is required for

proliferation of activated lymphocytes. Because most other cells have an alternative pathwa
