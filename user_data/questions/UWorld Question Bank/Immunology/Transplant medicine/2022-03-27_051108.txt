This kidney transplant recipient with progressive decline in renal function most likely has
chronic allograft rejection. The process is a mixed cell-mediated and antibody-mediated
response and can occur anytime from several months to years posttransplantation.

Following transplant, T cells are activated and recipient antibodies are created against graft
HLA and other antigens. The activated T cells can initially cause cell-mediated acute rejection,
which is generally reversible via an increase in immunosuppression (eg, high-dose
glucocorticoids). Chronic rejection represents progression of cell-mediated and antibody-
mediated inflammation (eg, via activation of complement and recruitment of neutrophils) to the
point that irreversible renal damage takes place; the kidney grossly decreases in size, and
histopathology shows obliterative vascular wall thickening with tubular atrophy and
interstitial fibrosis.

Due to increased sodium retention, declining renal function in chronic rejection is also
commonly accompanied by new or worsening hypertension. Chronic rejection is the most
common cause of renal graft failure following transplant.

(Choice A) A dense, interstitial, mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is characteristic of acute
allograft rejection, which is most often a primarily T cell-mediated process. Acute rejection

typically occurs <6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom
