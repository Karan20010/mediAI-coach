¢ Thickened stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis)
¢ Papilloma formation
e Perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization (koilocytosis)

(Choice A) Intraepidermal fracturing (acantholysis) and formation of multinucleated cells are
seen in herpes simplex labialis. Although this condition is often found on the lips and perioral

skin, it presents with acute/recurrent blisters and ulcers.

(Choice C) Impetigo is a gram-positive skin infection that generates a neutrophilic infiltrate. It
presents with erythema, blistering, and shallow ulcers with honey-colored crusts.

(Choice D) Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against
hemidesmosomes, leading to subepidermal complement activation and cleavage. It is most
common at age >60 and typically presents with pruritic plaques, erosions, and tense bullae.

Educational objective:

Cutaneous warts (ie, verruca vulgaris) are caused by human papillomavirus and typically
present as rough, skin-colored papules. If necessary, biopsy can confirm the diagnosis and
shows epidermal hyperplasia, thickened stratum corneum, papilloma formation, and

cytoplasmic vacuolization.
