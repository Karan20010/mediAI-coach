This patient with diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity has hepatic cirrhosis, likely due to

long-standing nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Cirrhosis is the end stage of multiple

liver diseases and is characterized by replacement of normal lobular architecture with

regenerating nodules separated by bridging fibrous septa.

Cirrhosis can be visualized histologically as thickened collagenous bands (which stain blue
with Masson trichrome stain) separating clusters of hepatocytes. Fat infiltration (ie, hepatic
steatosis, visible as clear vacuoles within the parenchyma) is commonly seen in both alcohol-
induced fatty liver disease and NAFLD. In response to chronic injury, stellate (Ito) cells in the
space of Disse are activated and transform into myofibroblasts capable of proliferating,
promoting chemotaxis, and producing collagen in large quantities. This leads to progressive
scar formation and cirrhosis.

Manifestations of cirrhosis include jaundice, scleral icterus, spider angiomas, and elevated
liver enzymes. Evidence of abnormal hepatic synthetic function (eg, abnormal coagulation
parameters, hypoalbuminemia) and thrombocytopenia are also common.

(Choice A) Cholangiocytes are epithelial cells within the bile duct system. They transport ions

and solutes into bile as it travels through the canaliculi.

Choice B) Hepatocytes are located in the liver parenchyma and have many functions
