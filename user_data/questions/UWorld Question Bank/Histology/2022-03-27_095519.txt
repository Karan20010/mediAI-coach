(Choice A) Disruption of the GBM in PSGN causes increased filtration of proteins such as
albumin, which are lost in urine and do not deposit in the GBM. The loss of albumin results in

decreased plasma oncotic pressure and subsequent peripheral edema.

(Choice B) Complement activation in PSGN occurs primarily via the alternative and lectin
pathways, resulting in glomerular C3 deposition without significant C1 or C4 deposits.
Subendothelial C1q deposits are characteristic of type 1 membranoproliferative GN.

(Choice D) Fibrin deposits are found in rapidly proliferative (crescentic) GN.
(Choice E) IgE deposits are sometimes seen in lupus nephritis and are confined to the
capillary wall. These are associated with a poorer prognosis.

(Choice F) M protein is a component of the streptococcal cell wall that acts as an
antiphagocytic virulence factor. The cross-reactivity of antibodies directed against M protein
within myocardial cells may be responsible for rheumatic heart disease. However, M protein
has not been isolated in the immune complexes in PSGN.

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is most common in children and presents with nephritic
