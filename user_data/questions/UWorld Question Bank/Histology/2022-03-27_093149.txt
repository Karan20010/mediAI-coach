the intestine, renal tubules, and endocrine glands.

(Choice C) Gap junctions are composed of connexin proteins that create channels between
cells, permitting the free passage of small ions (eg, Ca) and molecules.

(Choice D) Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes but bind the basal layer of
epithelial cells to the basement membrane. Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomes in the
skin cause bullous pemphigoid.

(Choice E) Intermediate junctions (zonula adherens or belt desmosomes) are located below
tight junctions and form a beltlike anchor between adjacent cells in association with actin

microfilaments.

Educational objective:

The blood-brain barrier is formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary
endothelial cells that prevent the paracellular passage of fluid and solutes. This barrier only
permits the passage of substances from the blood to the brain via transcellular movement
across the endothelial plasma membrane, which is limited by diffusion or carrier-mediated
transport.
