(Choice A) The alveoli are comprised of simple squamous epithelium. This thin and flat
epithelium facilitates rapid transmembrane exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

(Choice B) The false vocal cords, also known as ventricular folds, are folds of mucous
membrane lined in respiratory epithelium, which is ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and
mucus-secreting. The false vocal cords are adjacent to the true vocal cords and help to
lubricate the true vocal cords with mucus and protect the airway from foreign bodies.

(Choices C and D) The paranasal sinuses and trachea also are lined in respiratory
epithelium. This ciliated, pseudostratified, columnar, and mucus-secreting epithelium protects
the respiratory tract from debris and pathogens. Goblet cells secrete mucus to trap particulate
matter, and the cilia beat in a rhythmic fashion to propel this mucus/debris toward the oral
cavity, where it can be swallowed or coughed up.

Educational objective:

Human papilloma virus (HPV) is a small DNA virus with a tropism for stratified squamous
epithelium, which protectively lines anatomical areas that undergo frequent friction and
abrasion, including the true vocal cords, cervix, and anus. Infants can acquire respiratory
papillomatosis via passage through an HPV-infected birth canal.
