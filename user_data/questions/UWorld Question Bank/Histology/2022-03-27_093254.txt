Langerhans cells (not to be confused with Langhans giant cells, a type of multinucleated cell
formed from macrophages) are the form of dendritic cell most commonly found in the skin and
mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells that interact
closely with T lymphocytes. Dendritic are the most effective form of antigen presenting cell
because they constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 cell surface
molecules. They also take up antigen by constant endocytosis and pinocytosis from their
environment.

Langerhans cells are derived from the myeloid cell line and express myeloid cell surface
markers. They contain characteristic "racquet-shaped" intracytoplasmic granules (Birbeck
granules) that are only visible on electron microscopy.

(Choice A) Kupffer cells are macrophage-derived cells present in the liver that compose part
of the reticuloendothelial system. Kupffer cells lie within the hepatic sinusoids and, like any
other macrophage, serve a phagocytic role in the liver.

(Choice C) Merkel cells are neuroendocrine cells of the basal layer of the epidermis, often
found in association with nerve projections, that play a role in perception of touch. They are
associated with a rare but highly malignant form of skin cancer known as Merkel cell
