This patient has adenomyosis, a disorder caused by an abnormal collection of endometrial
glands and stroma within the uterine myometrium. Adenomyosis is common in
multiparous women, and prior uterine surgery (eg, cesarean delivery) is a risk factor.
Although the exact pathogenesis is unclear, adenomyosis may occur due to endometrial

invagination into the myometrium during periods of myometrial weakening or changes in
vascularity at the endomyometrial interface (eg, pregnancy, uterine surgery). The clinical
features of adenomyosis reflect its pathophysiology:

¢ endometrial gland proliferation and cyclic bleeding within the myometrium leads to
dysmenorrhea and uterine tenderness

¢ abnormal myometrial hyperplasia and hypertrophy results in a concentric, uniformly
enlarged uterus

¢ uterine enlargement and subsequently increased endometrial surface area
causes regular, heavy menstrual bleeding

Definitive therapy is with hysterectomy, which allows for histologic diagnosis.

(Choice A) Leiomyomas (ie, uterine fibroids) are benign myometrial smooth muscle cell
tumors. Although fibroids can cause regular, heavy menses (also due to increased
