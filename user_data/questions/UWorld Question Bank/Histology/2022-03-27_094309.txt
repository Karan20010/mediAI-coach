Kinesin is a microtubule associated motor protein whose function is anterograde transport of
intracellular vesicles and organelles toward the plus (rapidly growing) ends of microtubules.
Kinesin uses energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to move along the microtubule. The plus
ends of microtubules typically lie at sites distant from the nucleus; thus, in neurons, kinesin
carries vesicles and organelles away from the cell body and toward the nerve terminal. A
targeted toxic insult to this protein would be expected to impair anterograde transport resulting

in a deficiency of synaptic vesicles at the nerve terminal.
(Choice A) The Nissl substance in neurons corresponds to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.

(Choice C) The transverse tubule (T-tubule) system is a tubular network located at the
junction of the A and | bands of striated myocytes. T-tubules are open to the extracellular
space and facilitate the spread of depolarization to the inside of the cell.

(Choice D) Desmosomes are protein aggregates that mediate cell-cell adhesion between
epithelial cells.

(Choice E) Microvilli are small cylindrical extensions of the apical plasma membrane that
contain actin thin filaments. Microvilli cover the apical surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells.
They do not contain microtubules or microtubule associated proteins.
