the gastric lining from acid.

(Choice C) In contrast to the parietal cell-rich superficial gastric glands, the deeper region of
the gastric glands has a preponderance of small, basophilic, granular chief cells that
synthesize and secrete pepsinogen. Pyloric glands contain enteroendocrine cells with apical
nuclei and light cytoplasm that produce gastrin and somatostatin.

(Choice D) This region contains the muscularis mucosae, which separates the lamina propria
from the submucosa.

(Choice E) This region contains the submucosa, which consists of well-vascularized
connective tissue.

Educational objective:

Pernicious anemia is an autoimmune disorder caused by the cell-mediated destruction of
parietal cells in the superficial upper glandular layer of the gastric body and fundus. Parietal
cells are responsible for the secretion of hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein
involved in the absorption of B,,. Deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and neurologic

dysfunction.
