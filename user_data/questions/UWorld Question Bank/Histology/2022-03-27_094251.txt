3 and end at the termination of the smallest bronchi (they are not found in bronchioles).
4
5 (Choice C) Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells that are present from the trachea down to
: the larger bronchioles. They are not found within the terminal bronchioles, which are lined by
8 club cells.
9
to (Choices D and E) The submucosal mucous glands and serous glands are found from the
= trachea to the distal-most bronchi and produce mucinous components that help trap inhaled
re) particles. They are not present within the bronchioles.

Educational objective:

Bronchi have a ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium with mucin-secreting goblet cells
and submucosal mucoserous glands. The airway epithelium gradually changes to ciliated
simple cuboidal by the level of the terminal bronchioles. Bronchioles lack glands and cartilage,
and the number of goblet cells decreases distally, ending before the terminal bronchioles.
Ciliated epithelium persists up to the respiratory bronchioles.
