Educational objective:

Celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy) classically presents between age 6-24 months
with abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. Duodenal biopsy reveals crypt
hyperplasia, villous atrophy, and intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration. Treatment with a gluten-
free diet resolves symptoms and normalizes serology and histology.
