have a unilateral erythematous, intensely pruritic, ulcerative lesion over the nipple and areola,
which is not seen in this patient.

(Choice B) Fibrocystic changes of the breast may show cysts with or without metaplasia and
areas of fibrosis. Patients with fibrocystic changes typically have cyclic breast pain, not nipple
discharge.

(Choice D) Fat necrosis typically presents as an irregular breast mass with no associated
nipple discharge after localized trauma or biopsy. Microscopy may show adipocytes
undergoing necrosis with inflammation, including macrophages and giant cells.

(Choice E) Fibroadenomas are small, firm, and mobile breast masses that occur due to
proliferation of breast stroma and ducts. Fibroadenomas do not typically cause bloody nipple
discharge. Microscopic examination shows stromal proliferation compressing the ducts to
slits.

Educational objective:

Intraductal papilloma is characterized by epithelial and myoepithelial cells lining fibrovascular
cores in a cyst wall or duct. It is the most common cause of bloody nipple discharge and
typically presents without breast masses or skin changes.
