Predominant light microscopic changes

4-12 hours « Wavy fibers with narrow, elongated myocytes
12-24 hours « Myocyte hypereosinophilia with pyknotic (shrunken) nuclei
4-3 days * Coagulation necrosis (loss of nuclei & striations)
“8 day * Prominent neutrophilic infiltrate
3-7 days * Disintegration of dead neutrophils & myofibers
“7 day * Macrophage infiltration at border areas
7-10 days « Robust phagocytosis of dead cells by macrophages
- y * Beginning formation of granulation tissue at margins
10-14 days * Well-developed granulation tissue with neovascularization
