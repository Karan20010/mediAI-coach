This patient with respiratory failure, hypoxemia, and thickened bronchial walls with
inflammatory infiltrates and mucous gland enlargement likely had chronic bronchitis.

Chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic, productive cough with airflow limitation and is
part of the spectrum of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is most commonly caused by
tobacco smoking. Chronic irritation by other inhaled environmental substances, such as air
pollutants and grain, cotton, or silica dusts, can also contribute to its development. Biopsy
typically shows thickened bronchial walls with predominantly lymphocytic infiltrates,
mucous gland enlargement with increased numbers of goblet cells (increasing mucus
production), and patchy squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa.

(Choice A) Patients with allergic asthma can develop pathologic remodeling of the bronchial
wall, which includes thickening of the bronchial epithelium, basement membrane, and
bronchial smooth muscle as well as edema, inflammatory infiltrates, and submucosal mucous
gland enlargement. However, the infiltrates consist predominantly of eosinophils and mast
cells. In addition, although asthma is a risk factor for chronic bronchitis, smoking is a much
more common cause.
