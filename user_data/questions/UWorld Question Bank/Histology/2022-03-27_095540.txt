A 43-year-old man comes to the office due to shortness of breath and fatigue. Over the last 2
weeks, his fatigue has been so profound that he has "little energy, even to get out of bed."

The patient has no chills but has experienced recent weight gain and ankle swelling. He has
no prior medical conditions and takes no medications. Blood pressure is 168/94 mm Hg, and
pulse is 95/min and regular. The patient has bilateral lower extremity pitting edema limited to
the ankles. Urinalysis reveals 2+ protein, white blood cell count of 5-7/hpf, and red blood cell
count of 75-100/hpf. He undergoes a kidney biopsy; immunofluorescent microscopy findings

are shown in the image below.
