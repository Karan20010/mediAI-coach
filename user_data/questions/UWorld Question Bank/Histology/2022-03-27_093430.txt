tumors. Although fibroids can cause regular, heavy menses (also due to increased
endometrial surface area), the uterus is typically nontender and irregularly enlarged rather than
tender and uniformly enlarged.

(Choice B) An ectopic pregnancy most commonly occurs due to abnormal blastocyst

implantation in the fallopian tube. Although prior tubal surgery (eg, bilateral tubal ligation) is a
risk factor, ectopic pregnancy is unlikely in this patient with a negative urine B-hCG. In
addition, uterine enlargement would not be seen.

(Choice D) Endometrial polyps are benign, intracavitary, focal hyperplastic growths of
endometrial tissue. In contrast to adenomyosis, endometrial polyps cause painless
intermenstrual bleeding rather than painful, cyclic, heavy menses. There is also no associated
uterine tenderness or enlargement.

(Choice E) Patients with endometrial hyperplasia have unregulated endometrial gland
proliferation with increased gland-to-stroma ratio; the thickened endometrial lining may slightly
increase uterine size and cause heavy menses. However, endometrial hyperplasia does not
typically cause dysmenorrhea or uterine tenderness. In addition, the most common risk factor
is unopposed estrogen from chronic anovulation and/or obesity; this patient has regular
menses and a normal BMI.
