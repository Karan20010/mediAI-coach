Postmortem histopathology of this patient's myocardium reveals a dense neutrophilic infiltrate
surrounded by relatively normal myocytes consistent with the morphologic changes expected
in the border zone of ischemic injury 1-3 days after myocardial infarction (MI). Myocardial
cells are highly metabolically active and susceptible to ischemic injury after as little as 3-4
minutes of oxygen deprivation due to coronary artery blockage.

After irreversible myocardial injury, a series of characteristic microscopic changes occur over
predictable time frames due to coagulative necrosis of myocardial fibers and infiltration of
inflammatory cells, which play an essential role in the healing process:

¢ During the first 4 hours post-MI, no visible change occurs although cardiac-specific
enzymes can be detected in the patient's bloodstream (Choice A).

¢ From 4 to 24 hours post-MI, changes due to digestion of cytoplasmic organelles,
denaturation of proteins, and loss of RNA become visible (eg, wavy, hypereosinophilic
myocytes with shrunken nuclei), especially in the central portion of the infarct.

e From 1 to 3 days post-MI, neutrophils infiltrate the border zone of the injured tissue in

response to proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-8), eventually migrating to the central
portion of the infarct. These neutrophils phagocytize dead myocytes and release
