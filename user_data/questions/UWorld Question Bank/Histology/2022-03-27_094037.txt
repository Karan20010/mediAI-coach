In addition to its role in wound healing, type | collagen (the most abundant type) provides
strength and support for a variety of cellular tissues and organs (eg, tendons, ligaments,
skin). It is also the major organic component in bones and significantly contributes to overall
bone strength. Defects in type | collagen can occur in osteogenesis imperfecta, an autosomal
dominant disorder that may present with fragile bones and ligament laxity.

(Choices A, C, and D) Basement membrane contains type IV collagen; hyaline cartilage (eg,
articular surfaces) and nucleus pulposus contain type II collagen.

(Choice B) Granulation tissue is a capillary-rich fibroblastic proliferation composed primarily
of type III collagen. Although granulation tissue is seen approximately 7 days after an acute
myocardial infarction, it is eventually replaced by type | collagen as the infarct heals. Type Ill
collagen is involved in the structural maintenance of extensible connective tissues and is often

found alongside type | collagen.

Educational objective:

Type | collagen is the primary collagen in mature scars (eg, remote myocardial infarction). It is
the most prevalent type of collagen and provides strength and support throughout the human
body, particularly in bones, tendons, ligaments, and skin.
