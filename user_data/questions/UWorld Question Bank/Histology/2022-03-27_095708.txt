Educational objective:

Anti-glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies react with collagen type IV, causing
rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with glomerular crescent formation on light microscopy.
Immunofluorescence demonstrating linear deposits of IgG and C3 along the GBM is

characteristic.
