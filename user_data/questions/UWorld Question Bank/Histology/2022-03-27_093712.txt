Within a single Haversian system, the central canal is encircled by multiple concentric lamellae
of bony matrix that each contains lacunae filled with osteocytes and extracellular bone fluid.
Delicate canaliculi radiate from each lacuna to create a reticular network with adjacent
lacunae, and the cytoplasmic processes of the osteocytes lie within these canaliculi. These
cytoplasmic processes send signals to and exchange nutrients and waste products with the
osteocytes within neighboring lamellae via gap junctions.

The osteocytes serve to maintain the structure of the mineralized matrix and control the short-
term release and deposition of calcium (i.e., calcium homeostasis). The plasma calcium
concentration directly dictates the metabolic activity of osteocytes, while parathyroid hormone
and calcitonin indirectly influence their metabolic activity. Osteocytes can also sense
mechanical stresses and send signals to modulate the activity of surface osteoblasts, thereby
helping to regulate bony remodeling.

(Choice A) Tight junctions (zonula occludens) are observed at the apices of glandular cells
and consist of two closely adherent cytoplasmic membranes without an intervening space.
Tight junctions are the first component of the junctional complex.

(Choice B) Hemidesmosomes are half desmosomes that extend from the basal surfaces of
