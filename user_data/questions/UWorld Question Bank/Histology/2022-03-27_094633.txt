(Choice B) Hepatocytes are located in the liver parenchyma and have many functions,
including protein synthesis and storage, fatty acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cholesterol
synthesis, and drug metabolism.

(Choice C) Kupffer cells are macrophages that reside within hepatic sinusoids. They are
indirectly involved in fibrogenesis because they generate cytokines (ie, TNF-alpha) to assist in
the activation of stellate cells; however, their primary function is bacterial phagocytosis and the
clearance of red blood cells.

(Choice D) Sinusoidal endothelial cells, which line hepatic sinusoids, are fenestrated cells
that filter solutes out of the blood and into hepatocytes. They assist in the removal of

metabolic waste and other macromolecules from circulation.

Educational objective:

Stellate (Ito) cells are the primary cells involved in hepatic fibrosis. In response to hepatic
injury, the stellate cells are activated and transform into myofibroblasts capable of proliferating,
promoting chemotaxis, and producing large quantities of collagen. Collagen stains blue with

Masson trichrome stain.
