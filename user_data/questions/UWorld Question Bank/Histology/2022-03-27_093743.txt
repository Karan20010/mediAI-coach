Ninety-five percent of the alveolar surface is covered by flat type | pneumocytes. The
remaining 5% is covered by interspersed cuboidal type Il pneumocytes that make up more
than half of the total number of alveolar cells. Type Il pneumocytes are the source of
pulmonary surfactant and have the ability to proliferate in response to injury. They also act
as progenitor cells for type | pneumocytes, which cannot regenerate on their own (Choice E).

(Choice A) Alveolar macrophages are a self-maintaining population derived from fetal
monocytes during lung development. They are the principal cells involved in clearing inhaled
foreign particles from the terminal respiratory units.

(Choice B) The pseudostratified, ciliated, columnar epithelium of the tracheobronchial tree
gradually tapers to become a simple ciliated cuboidal epithelium at the level of the terminal
bronchioles. Ciliated cells are absent from the lining of alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.

(Choice C) Club cells are nonciliated, secretory cells found predominantly in the terminal
portions of the bronchioles. These cells can act as a regenerative source of ciliated cells in the
bronchioles.

(Choice D) Goblet cells are found in the respiratory epithelium of the bronchi and larger
bronchioles; they are absent from the alveolar mucosa. Goblet cells are considered terminally-
