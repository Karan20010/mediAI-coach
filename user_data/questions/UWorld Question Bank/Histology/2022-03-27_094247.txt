Ciliated mucosal epithelium lines the pulmonary airways from the trachea to the respiratory
bronchioles. The airway epithelium gradually changes from pseudostratified ciliated columnar
to ciliated simple cuboidal by the level of the terminal bronchioles. Ciliated cells continue to
be present through the proximal portions of the respiratory bronchioles, but are not present
in the alveolar ducts or in the alveoli themselves. This arrangement is important because cilia
function to propel mucus toward the pharynx. The presence of cilia beyond the most distal
mucus-producing cells (goblet cells end before the terminal bronchioles) prevents bronchiolar

mucus accumulation and airflow obstruction.

(Choice A) The rings of hyaline cartilage that encircle the trachea are replaced by
cartilaginous plates in the bronchi. These rings and plates help keep the larger airways open
and end at the termination of the smallest bronchi (they are not found in bronchioles).
(Choice C) Goblet cells are mucus-secreting cells that are present from the trachea down to
the larger bronchioles. They are not found within the terminal bronchioles, which are lined by
club cells.

(Choices D and E) The submucosal mucous glands and serous glands are found from the
trachea to the distal-most bronchi and produce mucinous components that help trap inhaled
