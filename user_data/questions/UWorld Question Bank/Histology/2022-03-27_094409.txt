nuclear envelope. In addition to providing structural support, they also help to organize the
genome and regulate gene transcription.

(Choice D) Selectins are a group of cell adhesion molecules that are expressed on
endothelial cells during the inflammatory response. They function to bind leukocytes, allowing
them to exit blood vessels at the site of inflammation.

(Choice E) Spectrin is a cytoskeletal protein located intracellularly along the plasma
membrane. It is responsible for maintaining the distinct shape of red blood cells. Protein
defects may result in hereditary elliptocytosis and spherocytosis.

(Choice F) Vimentin is a type of intermediate filament expressed in mesenchymal cells. It is
responsible for securing organelles inside the cytosol and provides resistance to mechanical

stress.

Educational objective:

Kinesin is a microtubule-associated motor protein that functions in the anterograde transport of
materials and organelles within cells. Reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus requires
anterograde transport of viral particles from neuronal cell bodies in the sensory ganglia to the

skin and oral mucosa.
