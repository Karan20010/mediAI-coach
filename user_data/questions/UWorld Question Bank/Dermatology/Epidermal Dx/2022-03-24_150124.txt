This patient has vitiligo, which is characterized by flat, well-circumscribed patches of
depigmentation of variable size due to the partial or complete loss of melanocytes. These
lesions often manifest by the second or third decade of life and can be more obvious in
individuals with darkly pigmented skin. Vitiligo classically erupts on the face, extremities,
axillae, groin, and over hard bony surfaces (eg, knees). Histologic examination of the affected
epidermis would demonstrate the absence of melanocytes and melanin pigment.

The pathogenesis of melanocyte loss in vitiligo is likely a combination of autoimmune
activity, neurohumoral toxicity specific for melanocytes, and melanocytic self-destruction (eg,
toxic intermediate exposure during melanin synthesis). Autoimmune activity seems to have
the strongest correlation with vitiligo due to the presence of circulating melanocyte antibodies
in patients and the high prevalence of concurrent autoimmune disorders (e.g., type | diabetes
mellitus, pernicious anemia, Addison disease, autoimmune thyroiditis).
