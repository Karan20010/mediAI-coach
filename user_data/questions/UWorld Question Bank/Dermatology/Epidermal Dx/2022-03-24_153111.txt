This patient has hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), which is characterized by painful, deep-
seated nodules and scar formation in the axillae, groin, and medial thighs. The
pathogenesis of HS begins with the occlusion of folliculopilosebaceous units caused by
keratinocyte hyperproliferation and abnormal keratinocyte differentiation. Mechanical stress
(eg, friction in intertriginous areas) then leads to follicular rupture and the release of
proinflammatory contents. Contributing factors include tobacco use, immune dysregulation,
hormonal factors (eg, excessive androgen effect), and bacterial colonization/infection.

HS is a chronic, recurring condition with progressive formation of draining abscesses,
sinus tracts (formed by epithelial stem cells released from follicular rupture), comedones
(from significant follicular damage), and extensive fibrosis. In contrast to common furuncles
and carbuncles, which usually resolve completely with drainage and antibacterial therapy, HS
may persist and recur despite months of antibiotic therapy.
