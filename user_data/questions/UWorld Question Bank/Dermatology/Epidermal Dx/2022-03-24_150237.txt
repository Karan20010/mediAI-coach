This patient has typical features of acne vulgaris. Acne usually appears in adolescence and
can present with a variety of lesions, including comedones, papules, pustules, or inflammatory
nodules, often with lesions in different stages concurrently. Nodular (sometimes called
nodulocystic) acne, as in this patient, is often painful, difficult to treat, and can lead to the
formation of sinus tracts and residual scarring.

Acne vulgaris is characterized by inflammation of pilosebaceous follicles. Contributing
factors include hyperkeratinization and obstruction of follicles; sebaceous gland enlargement
with increased sebum secretion; colonization of the gland by Propionibacterium
(Cutibacterium) acnes, which metabolizes lipids in sebum and produces proinflammatory
factors; and follicular and perifollicular inflammation with follicular rupture.
