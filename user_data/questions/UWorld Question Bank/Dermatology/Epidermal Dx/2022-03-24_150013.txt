Acne vulgaris is a disorder of the pilosebaceous follicle. Hyperkeratinization and
obstruction of the follicle in combination with glandular enlargement and increased sebum
production provides an optimal environment for Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes.
This organism metabolizes sebaceous lipids, releasing inflammatory factors that lead to
follicular and perifollicular inflammation. Acne is most common in areas with a high
concentration of sebaceous follicles, including the face, back, chest, and upper arms.

Androgens stimulate production of sebum, and increased androgen levels (eg, puberty,
polycystic ovary syndrome) increase the incidence of acne. Obstruction of the glands, such as
by oil-based hair products (pomade acne), also promotes acne. In addition, mechanical
irritation can promote acne by increasing glandular occlusion and disruption of follicles (acne
mechanica). Sports participation, as in this patient, frequently triggers acne due to the use
of tight-fitting clothing (eg, sports bras) and protective gear (eg, helmets).
