(Choice B) Autosomal recessive inheritance classically shows disease development in 25%
of offspring from 2 asymptomatic carrier parents. In most cases, conditions with autosomal
recessive inheritance will not be seen in consecutive generations.

(Choice C) Conditions passed through mitochondrial inheritance are transmitted only by the
mother, and all of her offspring are affected. Conditions transmitted by mitochondrial
inheritance include a number of uncommon neuromuscular disorders.

(Choice E) By definition, sporadic cases do not follow an inheritance pattern. Sporadic cases
occur haphazardly among unrelated members of a population over time. For example, there
may be a spontaneous gene mutation that causes a sporadic disorder in an individual with no
family history of the disease.
