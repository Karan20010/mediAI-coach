This patient's red papules and pustules on the face are consistent with inflammatory acne.
The pathogenesis of acne involves the following:

¢ Hyperkeratinization due to abnormal epithelial growth and differentiation of corneocytes
leads to keratin plug formation in the pilosebaceous follicles. These blocked follicles are
referred to as comedones (ie, whiteheads and blackheads).

¢ In response to androgen stimulation (eg, during pubertal adrenarche), sebaceous
glands enlarge (not involute) and increase production of sebum, a lipid-rich substance that
facilitates obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (Choice A).

e Cutibacterium acnes, an anaerobic bacteria that relies on sebum as a nutrient source,
proliferates in occluded follicles, triggering an inflammatory response that results in the
red papules and pustules characteristic of nodulocystic acne.
