(Choice A) Dermatitis herpetiformis most commonly occurs in patients with celiac disease
and is characterized by microabscesses containing fibrin and neutrophils at the dermal
papillae tips. Clinical manifestations include pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae that appear
symmetrically on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees), upper back, and buttocks.
(Choice B) Eccrine sweat glands produce watery sweat in response to exertion, high ambient

temperature, and emotional stress. The secretions from eccrine glands have little lipid content
and do not support heavy colonization by P acnes; therefore, these glands do not have a
prominent role in the pathogenesis of acne.

(Choice C) Bullous pemphigoid is characterized by an autoimmune process that causes the
epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal blisters. It presents with tense,
fluid-filled bullae on the inner thighs, forearms, axillae, groin, and abdomen.

(Choice D) Melanocyte disorders typically present with hyperpigmentation (eg, melasma) or
hypopigmentation (eg, vitiligo).

(Choice F) Erythema nodosum—characterized by painful, subcutaneous nodules, typically in
the lower legs—is a form of panniculitis (inflammation of the subcutaneous adipose tissue)
caused by a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to antigens associated with various conditions

(eg, herpes simplex).
