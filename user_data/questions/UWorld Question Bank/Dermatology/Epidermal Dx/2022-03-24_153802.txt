This patient has androgenetic alopecia (often called male pattern hair loss), which presents
with progressive hair loss at the temples, frontal hairline, and vertex. Androgenetic alopecia
is characterized by a shortened anagen hair growth phase in the affected portions of the scalp,
leading to shorter, thinner hair shafts (follicular miniaturization) with increased apoptosis at
the dermal papillae.

As the name implies, androgenetic alopecia is driven by both inherited (polygenic inheritance)
and hormonal factors. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) appears to be the primary androgen
responsible for hair loss. Although total androgen levels are similar in affected and unaffected
men, patients with androgenetic alopecia have a greater effect of DHT due to increased local
conversion of testosterone to DHT and increased concentrations of androgen receptors in
affected areas of the scalp.

Androgenetic alopecia can be treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride),
which decrease conversion of testosterone to DHT in the tissues. However, by preventing
conversion to DHT, they increase the level of testosterone, which is then available for
conversion to estradiol by aromatase. This can lead to mild feminizing effects (eg,
gynecomastia) in some patients. Other treatments for androgenetic alopecia include topical
minoxidil, a vasodilator that appears to increase the vascularity of the dermal papillae.
