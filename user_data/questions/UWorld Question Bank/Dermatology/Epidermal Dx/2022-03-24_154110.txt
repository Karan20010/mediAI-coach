(Choice B) Bacterial metabolism of apocrine secretions contributes to body odor.
Bromhidrosis is a condition characterized by excessive and offensive body odor.

(Choice C) Estrogen has antiandrogenic effects and inhibits sebum production. For this
reason, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives help to improve inflammatory acne.

(Choice D) As epithelial stem cells undergo mitosis in the basal layers of the epidermis,
newer cells form and undergo differentiation as they migrate toward the surface, replacing
epithelial cells that desquamate. Increased epithelial mitosis and desquamation (ie, topical
retinoids) helps extrude debris from comedones, limiting acne formation.
