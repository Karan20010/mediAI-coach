However, all rapidly dividing cells in the area (eg, hair follicle stem cells, melanocytes, basal
keratinocytes) treated by the radiation can be affected, initiating a series of characteristic skin
changes:

¢ Acute (<90 days after radiotherapy):
© Apoptosis of basal keratinocytes and epidermal edema

°o Dose-dependent effects ranging from erythema to desquamation (ie, skin peeling),
superficial ulceration, and/or blistering

© Pigment changes and loss of skin appendages (eg, hair follicles, sebaceous glands)
¢ Late (months to years after radiotherapy):

o Fibrosis, characterized histologically by homogenization of dermal collagen, due to
fibroblast activation by transforming growth factor-beta from damaged tissue and
responding immune cells

o Vascular damage, resulting in chronic hypoxia and ulceration

© Abnormal, dilated microvasculature (ie, telangiectasias)
