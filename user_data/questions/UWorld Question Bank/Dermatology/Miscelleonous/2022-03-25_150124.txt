This patient's rash that resolved with use of a barrier ointment was likely irritant contact
diaper dermatitis, the most common diaper rash in infants. Characteristic features include
erythematous papules confined within the diaper area. In contrast to candidal diaper
dermatitis, another common diaper rash caused by a secondary yeast infection, irritant contact
diaper dermatitis does not have skinfold involvement or satellite lesions (ie, discrete lesions
beyond the borders of the main rash).

Irritant contact diaper dermatitis is predominantly caused by skin barrier breakdown from
exposure to urine and stool trapped within the diaper. Patients with frequent stooling (eg,
diarrhea) are at increased risk because urease produced by fecal bacteria causes an
increase in local skin pH, which allows for activation of proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the
stratum corneum. Areas of macerated skin are then prone to frictional damage from the
diaper, which further exacerbates the rash.

The treatment for irritant contact diaper dermatitis is a thick barrier ointment (eg, petrolatum)
or paste (eg, zinc oxide), which provides the skin an adherent layer of protection from contact
with the stool and urine. Other measures to reduce irritant exposure include frequent diaper
changes and diaper-free periods.
