This patient most likely has atopic dermatitis (eczema), an inflammatory condition that
begins in infancy or early childhood. Pathogenesis involves genetically mediated skin barrier
dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) and a dysregulated immune response that favors IgE
production, mast cell and eosinophil activation, and overproduction of Th2 cytokines.

Loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to allergens/irritants, and inflammation
result in dry skin, intense pruritus, erythema, and, sometimes, weeping and crusting (as seen
in this patient). Distribution typically includes the face and the flexural areas of the elbows and

knees in children.

First-line treatment of atopic dermatitis is topical corticosteroids. However, due to concerns for
corticosteroid-induced atrophy in areas with thin skin (eg, face, neck, axilla, groin), second-line
therapy with calcineurin inhibitors (eg, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) can be used instead.
Through the inhibition of calcineurin, a lymphocyte-specific phosphatase, these medications
inhibit T-cell signaling that would normally lead to transcription of the proinflammatory
cytokine IL-2. Reduced IL-2 leads to decreased T-cell activation and proliferation, and, in

turn, inflammation.
