changes and diaper-free periods.

(Choice A) Abnormal keratin expression describes the pathogenesis of psoriasis, which
manifests as erythematous, scaly plaques. Psoriasis rarely presents in the diaper area and is
usually chronic and persistent without topical corticosteroid treatment.

(Choice C) Increased hapten sensitization describes allergic contact dermatitis, which is
uncommon in the diaper area but can occur with an allergy to a component (eg, dye,
fragrance) in diapers or wipes. The rash is unlikely to resolve without complete removal of the
offending antigen (eg, changing diaper brand), and topical corticosteroids are also required in
many cases.

(Choice D) Local bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus leads to
impetigo in the diaper area. Honey-crusted pustules are classic, and topical antibiotics are the
first-line treatment.

(Choice E) Scabies is a mite infestation that causes itchy, erythematous papules. The rash
can involve the diaper area, but lesions would also be expected elsewhere (eg, axillae, hands,
feet). Treatment is with permethrin, and resolution would not be expected with petrolatum
alone.
