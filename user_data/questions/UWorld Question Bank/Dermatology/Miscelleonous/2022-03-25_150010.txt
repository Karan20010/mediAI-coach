(Choice A) Galactose-1-phosphate sinciy ira nsteesse® which converts galactose into glucose,
is deficient in galactosemia. Galactitol deposition in the lens leads to cataract formation, not
foveal hypoplasia or optic nerve abnormalities. Early manifestations of galactosemia include
jaundice, vomiting, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive, none of which are seen here.

(Choice B) A defect in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase causes methylmalonic acidemia, an
organic acidemia that presents in newborns with vomiting, lethargy, respiratory distress, and
metabolic acidosis. Eye findings do not occur.

(Choice C) Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is a urea cycle disorder characterized by
hyperammonemia and encephalopathy (eg, vomiting, lethargy, seizures), not pigmentation
defects.

(Choice D) Sphingomyelinase deficiency is responsible for Niemann-Pick disease, a
lysosomal storage disorder that causes progressive neurodegeneration and
hepatosplenomegaly. A cherry-red macula is characteristic on eye examination.

Educational objective:

Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin biosynthesis typically
due to defective tyrosinase activity. Patients have reduced or absent melanin pigment in the
skin, hair, and eye, as well as abnormal development of the fovea and optic nerve fibers,
