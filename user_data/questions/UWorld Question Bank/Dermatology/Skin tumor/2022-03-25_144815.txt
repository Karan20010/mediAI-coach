The firm, violaceous nodules on this patient's right upper arm in the setting of chronic
lymphedema are consistent with angiosarcoma, a highly aggressive malignancy.
Angiosarcomas involving the breast, axilla, or upper extremity classically occur after treatment
of breast cancer due to either radiation exposure (resulting in lymph node sclerosis) or
extensive lymph node dissection causing chronic lymphedema.

During breast cancer treatment, the disruption of lymphatic channels can result in decreased
drainage of the upper extremity, causing persistent lymphatic buildup and chronic
lymphedema. Angiosarcoma develops in patients with chronic lymphedema, likely due to a
combination of increased lymphatic proliferation, which increases the likelihood of
malignant cells, and a decreased number of lymph nodes, which decreases the ability to
remove the malignant cells.

Symptoms often occur 10 years after breast cancer treatment, with the lymphatic arm or axilla
developing firm, purple nodules or a poorly healing eschar that rapidly enlarges and
coalesces. Because of the highly aggressive nature of angiosarcoma, patients typically have
metastatic disease and a poor prognosis.

(Choice B) Distant metastatic breast cancer is most likely to travel to bone, liver, and lung

tissue. Although breast cancer can spread to the skin. this is more likely to occur over the
