hemangioma dulls in color and softens, eventually resulting in complete resolution in early
childhood in most cases.

(Choice C) Port-wine stain, or nevus flammeus, is a capillary malformation that begins as a
flat, unilateral pink patch that grows proportionally with the child and may evolve into a deep
purple, thickened, nodular lesion. Port-wine stains do not regress in size.

(Choice D) Nevus simplex is a flat, pink, blanching vascular lesion that commonly occurs on
the eyelids, forehead, and nape of the neck. These lesions are benign and typically regress in
early childhood.

(Choice E) Acherry angioma is a vascular lesion characterized by a proliferation of capillaries
that remain stable in size. However, this lesion is typically small (<0.5 cm) and develops in
older adults, not infants.

Educational objective:

Infantile hemangioma is a common, benign vascular tumor that presents soon after birth as a
bright red, raised, sharply demarcated plaque. The natural course of hemangiomas is
proliferation in infancy followed by regression in early childhood.
