This older patient has a crusted, ulcerated, hyperpigmented nodule on the nipple and areola.
Biopsy was performed to differentiate Paget disease of the breast, an adenocarcinoma of the
areolar epithelium, from nodular malignant melanoma. Histopathology revealed poorly
differentiated cells with abundant mitotic activity and necrosis. Subsequent immunostaining
was positive for S-100 (a protein expressed in cells derived from the neural crest such as
melanocytes) and HMB-45 (a marker for immature melanosomes found in melanocytic
tumors) indicating melanoma.

Immunostaining is often used to assist the diagnosis of melanoma because histopathologic
features are sometimes insufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Tumor cells that stain positive
for multiple melanocyte markers (as in this case) are very likely to be melanoma. S-100 is
positive in >95% of melanoma tumors, and HMB-45 is both highly sensitive (>95%) and highly
specific (~100%) for the malignancy.

(Choice A) Basal cell carcinoma usually appears on the face as a nodular, flesh colored
papule. Although scaly trunk lesions can occasionally occur, this tumor is derived from basal
epithelial cells and would not stain positive for melanocyte markers.

(Choice C) Paget disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that occurs due to
intraductal spread of an underlying breast malignancy to the nipple skin. Although this can
