Infantile hemangiomas are not usually apparent at birth and typically present in the first few
days to weeks of life as bright red, raised, and sharply demarcated plaques. They can
arise anywhere in the body and usually occur as a single lesion on the skin and subcutaneous
tissue. Less commonly, multiple cutaneous hemangiomas may be present, increasing the risk
for visceral (eg, hepatic) lesions.

The natural progression of hemangiomas begins with proliferation in infancy due to growth of
blood vessels within the hemangioma. Following the proliferative phase, an involution phase
occurs, in which the lesion spontaneously regresses (Choice B). During involution, the
hemangioma dulls in color and softens, eventually resulting in complete resolution in early
childhood in most cases.

(Choice C) Port-wine stain, or nevus flammeus, is a capillary malformation that begins as a
flat, unilateral pink patch that grows proportionally with the child and may evolve into a deep
purple, thickened, nodular lesion. Port-wine stains do not regress in size.

(Choice D) Nevus simplex is a flat, pink, blanching vascular lesion that commonly occurs on
the eyelids, forehead, and nape of the neck. These lesions are benign and typically regress in
early childhood.
