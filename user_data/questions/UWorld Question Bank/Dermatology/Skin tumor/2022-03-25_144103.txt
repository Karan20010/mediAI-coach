indicates a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.

(Choice A) Glioblastoma is more likely to present as a single lesion; BRAF mutations are less
common than with melanoma.

(Choice C) Prostate cancer is associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, not BRAF
mutations. BRCA mutations also increase the risk of breast cancer.

(Choices D and E) Renal cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer appear to be
multifactorial in origin, involving many different genes and environmental factors. However,
BRAF has not been associated with either malignancy.

Educational objective:
BRAF is a protein kinase involved in activation of signaling pathways for melanocyte
proliferation; the BRAF V600E mutation is seen in 40%-60% of patients with melanoma.
