(Choice A) Basal cell carcinomas arise from basal keratinocytes, typically due to ultraviolet
radiation—induced mutations. Lesions are commonly pink or skin-colored (vs violaceous),
pearly or translucent, and located in sun-exposed areas such as the face (vs the thigh).

(Choice C) Cutaneous mastocytosis is caused by the pathologic accumulation of mast cells
within the skin, which, in adults, is often associated with systemic mast cell proliferation (ie,
systemic mastocytosis). Skin involvement typically manifests as monomorphic, reddish-brown
macules that gradually proliferate and spread over months to years; because of histamine
release, the lesions characteristically develop erythema or urticaria when scratched.

(Choice D) Sweet syndrome (ie, acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) is a rare inflammatory
disorder associated with pathologic neutrophilic infiltration into the skin. Because of their
inflammatory nature, lesions are typically erythematous, edematous, and tender; ulceration like
that of pyoderma gangrenosum (another neutrophilic disease of the skin) may occur. Lesions
are classically accompanied by frequent fever.

(Choice E) Melanocytic nevi are caused by the benign proliferation of nevus cells, a type of
melanocyte that forms clusters instead of single units evenly dispersed throughout the skin.
Acquired melanocytic nevi may be elliptical, raised, and nontender; however, they are not
typically violaceous, and most appear in childhood or adolescence (vs adulthood).
