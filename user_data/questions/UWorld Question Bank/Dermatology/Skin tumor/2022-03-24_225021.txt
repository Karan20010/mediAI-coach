promise in cancers that overexpress PD-L1 (eg, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma). Blockade
of PD-1 restores the cytotoxic T-cell response (disinhibition), which promotes tumor cell
apoptosis. Patients with advanced melanoma and other susceptible malignancies often have
a drastic clinical response (eg, tumor regression, long-term remission) to PD-1 antagonists.

(Choices A and E) Cancer-related inflammation also involves cells of the innate immune
system such as macrophages and neutrophils. These cells can have either protumor (eg,
release of matrix metalloproteases that facilitate invasion) and antitumor (eg, direct killing of
cancer cells) activities depending on the local cytokine milieu. However, PD-1 inhibitors do not
increase the antitumor activity of neutrophils or macrophages.

(Choice B) Tumor cells often induce desmoplasia, which refers to excessive connective
tissue/stroma growth around the tumor. A strong desmoplastic response can reduce the ability
of chemotherapeutic agents to penetrate into the tumor, leading to chemoresistance.

(Choice C) Angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, bevacizumab) are used to prevent neovascularization
of growing tumors, leading to ischemia and tumor necrosis. PD-1 inhibitors cause cytotoxic T-
cell activation, leading to increased apoptosis of tumor cells; they do not induce ischemic
necrosis.
