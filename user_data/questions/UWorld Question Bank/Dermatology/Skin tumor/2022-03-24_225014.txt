Educational objective:

Programmed-death receptor 1 (PD-1) is a checkpoint inhibitor that downregulates the cytotoxic
T-cell response. Neoplastic cells often exploit this receptor via the overexpression of PD-1
ligand. PD-1 receptor inhibitors (eg, Pembrolizumab) restore the T-cell response, allowing
cytotoxic T cells to invade the tumor and induce apoptosis of neoplastic cells.
