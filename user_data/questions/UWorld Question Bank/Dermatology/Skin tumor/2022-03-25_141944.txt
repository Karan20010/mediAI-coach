This patient's weight loss, early satiety, positive smoking history, and left supraclavicular
adenopathy are concerning for gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). Patients with GA can also
have epigastric pain, hematemesis, and occult blood loss in the stool. Physical examination
findings in advanced (metastatic) disease include left supraclavicular (Virchow node) or left
axillary lymphadenopathy, or a periumbilical mass (Sister Mary Joseph nodule).

In addition, rapid onset of numerous seborrheic keratoses (pigmented macules or plaques
with a greasy surface and well-demarcated borders) is a classic indicator of internal
malignancy (Leser-Tr√©lat sign), particularly GA, and is thought to occur in response to
increased tumor production of cytokines or growth factors (eg, IGF-1, fibroblast growth factor).
Acanthosis nigricans (a hyperpigmented skin disorder typically associated with insulin
resistance) can also occur in malignancy due to a similar mechanism (Choice A).
