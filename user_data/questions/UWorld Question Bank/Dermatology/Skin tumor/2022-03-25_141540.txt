Patients who are immunosuppressed from medications or infections (eg, HIV) are at increased
risk for malignancy due to reduced immunosurveillance by natural killer cells and the cell-
mediated immune response. Reduced immunosurveillance allows malignant cells to avoid
immunologic identification with fewer evasive adaptations; it also allows oncogenic viruses to
replicate in an unchecked fashion, which can trigger malignancy.
