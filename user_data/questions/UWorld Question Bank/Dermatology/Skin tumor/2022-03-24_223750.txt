Histopathology from this patient's lung lesion reveals features concerning for malignancy,
including disordered, pleomorphic cells; large nuclei; irregular nuclear shape and binucleation;
as well as prominent nucleoli. Although he is at risk for primary lung cancer due to a long
smoking history, the presence of brown pigment (melanin granules) in the cytoplasm of some
of the atypical cells indicates likely melanoma recurrence.

Surgical resection of cutaneous melanoma is sometimes curative, but the tumor often spreads
through the lymphatics and bloodstream to other organs early in the disease course; these
metastases can remain asymptomatic for months to years. Recurrence is generally diagnosed
when a suspicious lesion is identified and biopsy reveals malignant melanocytes (eg,
cytoplasmic melanin, cellular atypia) with positive immunostaining for melanocytic markers (eg,
$-100, HMB-45).
