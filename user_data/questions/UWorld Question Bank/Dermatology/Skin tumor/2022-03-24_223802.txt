Educational objective:

Melanoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that often metastasizes early in the disease
course. Patients may be asymptomatic for years prior to onset of metastatic manifestations.
Diagnosis is generally made when a histopathologic sample shows cellular atypia with cells
containing brown pigment (melanin granules); immunostaining for melanocytic markers (eg, S-

100, HMB-45) is generally positive.
