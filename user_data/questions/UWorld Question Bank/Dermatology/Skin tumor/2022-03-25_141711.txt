(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is an HLA-B27-associated spondyloarthropathy that affects
primarily young Caucasian males and causes debilitating pain and deformity of the spine and
hips.

(Choice B) Hemochromatosis ("bronze diabetes") can cause generalized darkening of the
skin due to hemosiderin deposition as well as cutaneous stigmata associated with chronic liver
disease (eg, palmar erythema, gynecomastia, spider telangiectasias).

(Choice C) Graves' disease (the most common cause of hyperthyroidism) can present with
pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos due to glycosaminoglycan accumulation. However,
glycosaminoglycan accumulation occurs within the retroorbital space (not over the eyelids). In
addition, hypothyroidism (not hyperthyroidism) is a common cause of hyperlipidemia.

(Choice D) Peptic ulcer disease may occur in multiple endocrine neoplasia 1.

(Choice E) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease causes mild persistent proteinuria
that can result in dyslipidemia. However, this is a less common cause of xanthelasma than
biliary cirrhosis.
