Microscopy of this patient's enlarging, crusted skin lesion reveals invasive nests of atypical
cells surrounding keratin pearls, which is consistent with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC). Although risk of cutaneous SCC is increased by solar damage, chronic inflammation,
and ionizing radiation, the primary driver of malignancy in this patient is likely the use of
immunosuppressive medications (eg, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, prednisone).

The innate and adaptive immune responses play a crucial role in the control of neoplasms, as
follows:
¢ Natural killer cells, a component of the innate immune system, destroy host cells with
surface markers signaling damage or distress and cells deficient in self markers such as
class | major histocompatibility complexes (MHC).
¢ Cytotoxic T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of cancer cells and destroy the
cell with cytotoxic granules.
¢ Helper T-cells identify tumor neoantigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells and
secrete effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha) that

promote anti-tumor immune activity.
