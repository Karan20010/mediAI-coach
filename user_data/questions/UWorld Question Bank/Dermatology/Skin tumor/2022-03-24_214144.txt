nipple that she first noticed several months ago. The lesion is itchy and is slowly increasing in

evidence of hyperpigmentation. Changes extend to the surrounding areola. Excisional biopsy
reveals relatively well-circumscribed aggregates of large, polygonal, pleomorphic cells with
abundant mitotic activity and surrounding necrosis. S-100 and HMB-45 stains are diffusely
positive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
