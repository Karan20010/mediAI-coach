This patient's forehead lesion has gross features and histologic findings consistent with actinic
keratosis (AK). AKs typically appear as scaly, erythematous lesions on sun-exposed areas
(eg, forehead). They arise from the proliferation of atypical epidermal keratinocytes, often
because of ultraviolet radiation—induced mutations that lead to increased survival and
proliferation of atypical cells.

On histologic examination, AKs show disorganized keratinocytes with signs of atypia, such as
nuclei that are hyperchromatic (ie, stained a darker color) and pleomorphic (ie, varying in
size/shape). The presence of mitoses reflects proliferative activity, and corresponding
epidermal thickening (ie, acanthosis) may be present. The overlying stratum corneum is
also often thickened (ie, hyperkeratosis) with retained nuclei (ie, parakeratosis). AKs are
considered premalignant lesions on a continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The
extent of epidermal involvement differentiates AK from SCC:

¢ AK: Atypical keratinocytes do not involve the full thickness of the epidermis.

¢ SCC in situ: Atypical keratinocytes involve the full thickness of the epidermis without

infiltration into the dermis.

¢ Invasive SCC: Atypical keratinocytes involve the full thickness of the epidermis and
