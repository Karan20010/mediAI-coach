(Choice A) Dermatofibromas (ie, benign fibrous histiocytomas) represent a benign
proliferation of dermal fibroblasts and histiocytes. They commonly appear as small, firm,
hyperpigmented, solitary papules/nodules that characteristically dimple when pinched. In
contrast to BCC, they typically appear on the lower extremities (vs the face) and lack central
telangiectasias.

(Choice B) Neoplastic proliferation of dermal vascular endothelial cells can give rise to cherry
angiomas, common benign vascular tumors in adults. These classically appear as multiple
small, blanchable, red papules on the trunk.

(Choice D) Epidermal melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells and reside within the
stratum basale, where they synthesize melanin, giving the skin pigmentation. They can
transform into malignant melanoma, which commonly appears as an asymmetric, pigmented
patch or plaque with irregular borders.

(Choice E) Lipomas are benign tumors that arise from subcutaneous adipocytes. They
characteristically form a soft, mobile, subcutaneous mass; the overlying epidermis is normal.

Educational objective:
Basal cell carcinomas arise from keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis or hair
