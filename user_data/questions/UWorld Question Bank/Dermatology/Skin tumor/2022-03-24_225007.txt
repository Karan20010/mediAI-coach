Neoplastic cells produce proteins not found in healthy cells. Pieces of these proteins
(neoantigens) are displayed on MHC class | molecules on the cell surface and are
subsequently recognized by cytotoxic T cells as "nonself" (leading to cellular apoptosis).
However, neoplastic cells generally accumulate genetic mutations that allow them to thwart the
cytotoxic T-cell response and evade detection/destruction. One common mechanism is the
overexpression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the cancer cell surface; this ligand
binds to the PD-1 receptor on cytotoxic T cells and suppresses their ability to induce apoptosis
(T-cell exhaustion).

Treatment with monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1 such as pembrolizumab have shown
promise in cancers that overexpress PD-L1 (eg, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma). Blockade
of PD-1 restores the cytotoxic T-cell response (disinhibition), which promotes tumor cell
apoptosis. Patients with advanced melanoma and other susceptible malignancies often have
a drastic clinical response (eg, tumor regression, long-term remission) to PD-1 antagonists.
