Educational objective:

Melanoma lesions often have multiple color variations. The different colors represent different
activities within the tumor. Whitish/gray areas occur when cytotoxic T cells recognize tumor
antigens and destroy malignant cells, leading to melanocyte regression. Red areas arise due
to vessel ectasia and local inflammation, whereas brown or black areas are generally due to
advancing malignant melanocytes.
