(Choices D and E) Petechiae (<5 mm diameter) and purpura (5 mm to 1 cm) are cutaneous
or subcutaneous collections of extravasated blood from small-vessel bleeding that are often
associated with platelet dysfunction or capillary fragility. They occur most commonly in areas
of increased venous pressure (eg, ankles, feet). Palpable purpura are an indicator of
leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

(Choice F) Telangiectasias are small, permanent dilations of superficial capillaries or
venules. Telangiectasias will blanch under pressure and are commonly seen in aging, chronic
solar damage, long-term glucocorticoid use, rosacea, and a variety of systemic disorders.

Educational objective:
Ecchymoses frequently indicate a deep hemorrhage (hematoma) due to bony fracture,
ligamentous rupture, or muscular injury. They do not blanch under pressure as the red blood

cells are not contained within the vasculature. Ecchymoses often pass through an evolution of

color change (blue or red to brown, green, and yellow), which can be used to estimate the age
of the injury.
