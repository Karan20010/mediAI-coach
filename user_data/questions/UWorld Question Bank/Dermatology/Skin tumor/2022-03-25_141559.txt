replicate in an unchecked fashion, which can trigger malignancy.

(Choice B) Peripheral T-cell tolerance (anergy) occurs when a T-cell binds to its
complementary antigen on surface MHC molecules but does not undergo costimulation.
Cancer cells often overexpress molecules (eg, CTLA-4) that bind up surface proteins
(CD80/86) required for T-cell costimulation, which increases (not decreases) peripheral T-cell

tolerance.

(Choice C) Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that shorten
progressively with cellular division, leading to chromosomal instability. Most tumors increase
(not decrease) the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that adds nucleotides to the telomere in
order to counteract shortening.

(Choice D) Tumors produce cytokines that impede the differentiation of monocytes to
macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which helps prevent phagocytosis and
destruction of tumor cells.

(Choice E) Tumor cells typically decrease (not increase) expression of class | MHC in order to
reduce display of neoantigens on their surface; this limits the ability of cytotoxic T-cells to
identify tumor antigens on the cell surface.
