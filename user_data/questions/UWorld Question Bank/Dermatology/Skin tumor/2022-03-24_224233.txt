Seborrheic keratosis (SK) (plural: keratoses) is a common, tan or brown, epidermal tumor
occurring in middle-aged or elderly individuals. It has a variable appearance from nearly flat
macules to raised, wart-like lesions, ranging in size from a few millimeters to centimeters. SK
typically has a velvety or greasy surface and well-demarcated border, and is often described
as having a “stuck-on" appearance. On microscopic examination, the lesions of SK are
composed of small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation, hyperkeratosis
(thickening of the stratum corneum), and keratin-containing cysts.

The etiology of SK is not fully understood; however, it is frequently associated with activating
mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3. SK itself is benign, but rapid onset of
numerous SKs (Leser-Trélat sign) is often associated with an internal malignancy (eg,
gastric adenocarcinoma), possibly due to overproduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 and
other cytokines.
