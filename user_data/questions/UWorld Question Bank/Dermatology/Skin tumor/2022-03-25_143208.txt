(Choice A) Epstein-Barr virus is associated with Burkitt lymphoma, particularly in patients
who are HIV positive. Burkitt lymphoma can involve the lymph nodes and may present with
lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms (eg, weight loss). However, red-purple,
papular skin lesions would not be expected.

(Choice B) Hepatitis C virus can cause cryoglobulinemia, which often presents with palpable
purpura (eg, nonblanching, hemorrhagic papules) on the lower extremities due to the
deposition of immune complexes in small vessels. These lesions are typically associated with
arthralgia and weakness.

(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus type 1 can cause herpetic whitlow, a cutaneous finger
infection characterized by clusters of vesicles (not red-purple papules) that may ulcerate and
crust, often accompanied by burning and tingling.

(Choice E) Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis, can have variable cutaneous
manifestations, depending on the stage of infection. Common skin lesions include chancres
(eg, painless anogenital ulcers with indurated borders), diffuse erythematous macules,
condylomata lata (eg, gray, wart-like growths), and gummata (eg, ulcerated nodules).
