This patient has actinic keratoses (AKs), which most commonly present as erythematous
papules with overlying whitish scale. They are often "felt more than seen" and have a rough,
sandpaper-like texture on palpation. The lesions are small and flat at first, but may enlarge
and become elevated. Usually their size does not exceed 10 mm in diameter. Hyperkeratosis
in such lesions may become prominent and form cutaneous horns.

AKs develop in genetically predisposed individuals age 40-60 under the influence of
excessive sun exposure. The most commonly affected areas are the face, ears, scalp, and
the dorsa of the arms and hands, but any other chronically sun-exposed site (legs, back, upper

chest) can be involved. AK is regarded as a premalignant condition, but less than 1% of
AKs per year will evolve into invasive squamous cell carcinoma.
