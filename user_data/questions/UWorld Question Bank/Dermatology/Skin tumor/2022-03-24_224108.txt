Wound healing generally proceeds in 3 phases:

1.

1e*)

The inflammatory phase begins with formation of a fibrin clot that results in hemostasis.
Cytokines released by activated platelets and damaged cells lead to migration of
neutrophils (within the first 24 hours) and macrophages (2-3 days later) to the damaged

area.

. The proliferative phase begins 3-5 days after the injury. Fibroblasts and endothelial

vascular cells proliferate to form connective tissue and blood vessels (neovascularization),
respectively. Around this time, epithelial cells begin to proliferate at the dermal edges and
secrete basement membrane material.

. The maturation phase is characterized by fibrosis (scar formation) and starts during the

second week after injury. During this phase, active fibroblasts synthesize collagen, elastin,
and other components of the connective tissue matrix.
