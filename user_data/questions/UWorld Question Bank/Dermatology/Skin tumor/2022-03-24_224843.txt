Malignant melanoma most often arises in the skin, although it may occur wherever there are
pigmented cells, such as the eye and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract. Sunlight
exposure appears to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of dermal melanoma, as are
hereditary factors and a history of preexistent dysplastic nevi. Light-skinned individuals are at
greatest risk.

On gross inspection, melanomas are characterized by asymmetric shape, irregular or jagged
border, variability of color (brown, black, red, blue, or unpigmented), diameter >0.5 cm, and
evolution in size and appearance over time (ABCDE criteria). Histologically, melanoma cells
congregate in poorly formed nests and are large with irregular nuclei, clumped chromatin, and
prominent nucleoli.

In early development, many melanomas exhibit a radial growth phase. This superficial,
horizontal growth within the epidermis and superficial dermis carries a very low risk of
metastatic spread (Choice A). In contrast, melanomas in the vertical growth phase contain
melanoma cells that travel downward into the deeper dermal layers, increasing metastatic
risk. Vertical growth often corresponds to a palpable nodularity of the lesion. The Breslow
depth (distance from the epidermal granular cell layer to the deepest visible melanoma cells)
is the most important prognostic indicator in malignant melanoma.
