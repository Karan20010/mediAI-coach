This patient with a likely history of extensive sun exposure has a left cheek lesion that is
histologically consistent with basal cell carcinoma (BCC). BCCs arise from keratinocytes in
the basal layer of the epidermis or hair follicle. They characteristically form nests (ie, nodular
aggregates) of crowded basaloid cells (ie, resembling the basal layer), which appear dark
blue on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining due to their basophilic, hyperchromatic nuclei
and scant cytoplasm (ie, high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio). The cells at the periphery
frequently display parallel alignment (ie, peripheral palisading), and clefting (ie, retraction
artifact) is often seen between the tumor and surrounding stroma following specimen
processing.

The most common (~80%) subtype of BCC, nodular BCC, usually appears as a pink- or skin-
colored papule or nodule, often with a pearly or translucent quality and central telangiectasias.
Although BCCs rarely metastasize, if left untreated (eg, refusal of surgical resection) they
may undergo continued local growth, causing progressive destruction of surrounding tissue.
This can eventually lead to invasion of adjacent structures such as bones or nerves; however,
neuronal spread (ie, neurotropism) that causes severe cancer-related pain is typically
associated with more aggressive cancers (eg, oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma,
pancreatic carcinoma) rather than BCC (Choice E).
