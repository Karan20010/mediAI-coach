(Choices A and D) Malignant melanoma is characterized by irregular and asymmetric
borders with variable coloration, diameter >6 mm, and evolution over time. Melanomas
typically expand superficially at first but may extend vertically into the dermis and
subcutaneous tissues, portending a poor prognosis. Compared to nevus cells, melanoma
cells are larger, contain irregular nuclei with prominent nucleoli, and have greater mitotic
activity. Atypical (dysplastic) nevi can resemble melanoma clinically but typically have less
extreme features. The melanocytes commonly show cellular atypia and form nests in the
epidermis that fuse with nests in adjacent rete ridges.

(Choice E) Pigmented basal cell carcinoma can present as papules, nodules, or plaques with
rolled borders on sun-exposed areas. They can have varying degrees of pigmentation due to
functional melanocytes within the lesion. The tumor cells resemble basal epidermal cells but
extend into the dermis and often form nests with a palisading arrangement (ie, parallel
alignment) of peripheral cells.

(Choice F) Seborrheic keratosis forms a hyperpigmented lesion with well-circumscribed
borders, a dull surface, and a "stuck-on" appearance. On microscopic examination, the
lesions are composed of small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation,
hyperkeratosis, and keratin-containing cysts.
