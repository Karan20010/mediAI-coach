5 (Choice A) Kupffer cells are macrophage-derived cells present in the liver that compose part

® of the reticuloendothelial system. Kupffer cells lie within the hepatic sinusoids and, like any

other macrophage, serve a phagocytic role in the liver.

(Choice C) Merkel cells are neuroendocrine cells of the basal layer of the epidermis, often
found in association with nerve projections, that play a role in perception of touch. They are
associated with a rare but highly malignant form of skin cancer known as Merkel cell

carcinoma.

(Choice D) Melanocytes are pigment producing cells of the epidermis that arise from the
neural crest cells and migrate to the basal layer of the epidermis during embryogenesis. They
possess dendritic processes that intercalate between the remaining cells of the epidermis and
facilitate the delivery of pigment-laden melanosomes from the melanocyte to the keratinocytes.

(Choices E and F) Macrophages can be found in the skin, possess myeloid cell surface
markers, and when stimulated, are able to produce dendrite-like extensions of their
cytoplasm. Macrophages can also differentiate into multinucleated (Langhans) giant cells and
epithelioid cells in the setting of granulomatous inflammation. However, monocytes and their
derivatives do not produce Birbeck granules.
