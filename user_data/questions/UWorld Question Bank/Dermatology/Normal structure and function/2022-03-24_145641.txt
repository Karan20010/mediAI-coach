Multiple environmental factors, especially exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, contribute to aging
of the skin. UVB wavelengths are predominantly absorbed in the upper dermis and contribute
to sunburn and increased risk of malignancy. UVA wavelengths penetrate deeper into skin
and cause photoaging. UVA produces reactive oxygen species, which activate multiple
inflammatory cell-surface receptors and nuclear transcription factors. This leads to decreased
collagen fibril production, along with upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases (including
collagenases) that subsequently degrade type | and III collagen and elastin (Choices C and
D).

Photoaging may be visible by age 30-35. Gradual thinning of the epidermis is seen, with
reduction in subcutaneous fat, blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat ducts, and sebaceous
glands. Rete ridges at the dermoepidermal junction become flattened. This loss of
subcutaneous tissue causes the skin to become atrophic and more vulnerable to damage. In
addition, there is increased crosslinking of collagen (Choice A), with deposition of collagen
breakdown products. The atrophic dermis and increased collagen crosslinking, along with
desiccation of the stratum corneum, produce the characteristic wrinkling of photoaged skin.
