pink epithelium). At this point, proliferation and migration signals cease, and the stratification
process begins.

(Choice A) During the proliferation phase of wound healing, transforming growth factor-beta
induces some fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts that produce intracellular
contractile proteins (eg, actin, myosin). Myofibroblast contraction helps decrease the size of
the wound.

(Choice C) Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that reside within the stratum basale.
They are derived from neural crest cells and are distinct from basal cells (ie, keratinocyte stem
cells). Failure of melanocytes to migrate into a healing scar can lead to permanent scar
hypopigmentation.

(Choice D) Several immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, are
responsible for pathogen phagocytosis during the inflammatory phase of wound healing.
Macrophages are of particular importance for clearing foreign bodies and cellular debris (eg,
apoptotic neutrophils).

Educational objective:

Keratinocytes are responsible for wound reepithelization. They migrate into the wound from its
