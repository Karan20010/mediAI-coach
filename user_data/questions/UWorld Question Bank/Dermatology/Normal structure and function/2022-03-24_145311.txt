This patient has a lesion with abundant capillaries and fibroblasts, which is characteristic of
granulation tissue. Raising of the lesion above the surrounding skin (tissue overgrowth) is
further consistent with excessive proliferation of granulation tissue (ie, hypergranulation tissue)
at the site of wound healing.

Granulation tissue is an essential component of the proliferative phase of normal wound
healing, providing the nutrients and structure needed for a wound to fill and reepithelialize.
Platelets and macrophages in and around a healing wound produce vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), which induces the vascular and fibroblast proliferation of granulation
tissue.

However, if VEGF-induced tissue proliferation continues unchecked, the resulting
hypergranulation tissue prevents wound epithelialization and remodeling. These lesions most
often occur at the site of nasogastric tubes or wounds left to heal by secondary intention (ie,
the wound is purposely left open).
