Educational objective:

Elevated blood glucose induces the release of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory
cytokines from neutrophils while inhibiting the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg,
IL-10) and growth factors needed for fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization in a healing
wound. As a result, patients with uncontrolled diabetes frequently have nonhealing wounds

with evidence of ongoing inflammation.
