Langerhans cells (not to be confused with Langhans giant cells, a type of multinucleated cell
formed from macrophages) are the form of dendritic cell most commonly found in the skin and
mucous membranes. Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells that interact
closely with T lymphocytes. Dendritic are the most effective form of antigen presenting cell
because they constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 cell surface
molecules. They also take up antigen by constant endocytosis and pinocytosis from their
environment.

Langerhans cells are derived from the myeloid cell line and express myeloid cell surface
markers. They contain characteristic "racquet-shaped" intracytoplasmic granules (Birbeck
granules) that are only visible on electron microscopy.
