5 (Choice A) Ulcerative colitis is characterized by mucosal inflammation, crypt abscesses
6 (neutrophils in glandular lumen), and ulcerations. Common dermal associations include
7
8 erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, and psoriasis. The papulovesicular rash seen in
° this patient is not consistent with any of these entities.

(Choice B) IgG-mediated skin disruption occurs in pemphigus vulgaris and bullous

pemphigoid. These conditions are characterized by large bullae and ulcerations that are not
confined to the extensor surfaces. Pemphigus vulgaris may involve the pharynx and
esophagus, but neither condition is associated with steatorrhea.

(Choice D) Elevated urinary porphyrin levels (ie, uroporphyrin, heptacarboxyl porphyrin) are
seen in porphyria cutanea tarda. This condition is characterized by skin fragility and blistering
lesions in sun-exposed areas. Steatorrhea would be unexpected.

(Choice E) Insulin resistance occurs in type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can be associated with
acanthosis nigricans and necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum. Although celiac disease and DH
are associated with other autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes, there is no
association with type 2 diabetes.
