Educational objective:

Allergic contact dermatitis is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction. Initially,
Langerhans cells present haptens to naive T cells, leading to clonal expansion. On
reexposure, sensitized CD8- T cells are recruited to skin and destroy tissue. Release of

interferon gamma by T cells further amplifies the immune response.
