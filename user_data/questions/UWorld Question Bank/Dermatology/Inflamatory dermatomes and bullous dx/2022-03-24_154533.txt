(Choice B) Acute allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by localized erythema, vesicles,
edema, and severe pruritus. Biopsy typically shows spongiosis (abnormal accumulation of
edema fluid in the intercellular spaces between keratinocytes) and lymphocytic perivascular
infiltrates but no separation of the epidermis from the dermis.

(Choice C) Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with small, pruritic papules and vesicles over
a extensor surfaces and is characterized histologically by microabscesses containing fibrin and
neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips. The overlying basal cells become vacuolated, and

as blisters form at the tips of the involved papillae.

7 (Choice D) Lichen planus causes pruritic, purple papules and plaques involving the skin and
mucous membranes (not blisters). Microscopic analysis shows a lymphocytic infiltrate at the

+ 20 dermal-epidermal junction with destruction of basal epidermal cells.

+ 22 (Choice E) Pemphigus vulgaris is due to autoantibodies directed against desmosomal
proteins. Biopsy of an active pemphigus lesion shows intraepithelial cleavage with detached
28 keratinocytes (acantholysis), retained keratinocytes along the basement membrane, and an
eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate.
