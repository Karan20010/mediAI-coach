This patient's rash is consistent with erythema multiforme (EM), an acute inflammatory
disorder that can involve the skin of the extremities, face, trunk, and neck. Severe cases (EM
major) can also affect oral mucous membranes and the tongue. The appearance of EM can
vary, but patients typically develop erythematous, round papules that evolve into target
lesions with a dusky central area, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring,
and an erythematous halo in the lesion's periphery.

EM represents a cell-mediated immune process, with an inflammatory infiltrate predominated
by cytotoxic CD8- lymphocytes. EM is most frequently associated with infections (especially
herpes simplex virus and mycoplasma) and may be due to an immune response against
antigens deposited in the skin. EM can also be seen in association with certain medications
(eg, sulfonamides), malignancy, and collagen vascular diseases.
