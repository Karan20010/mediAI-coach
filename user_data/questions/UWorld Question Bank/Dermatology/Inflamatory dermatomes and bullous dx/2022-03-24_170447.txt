(Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is caused by an autoantibody to desmoglein and results in a
positive Nikolsky sign and epidermal erosions, blisters, and bullae. This disorder is uncommon
in children, and mucous membranes are almost always involved.

(Choice B) Cell-mediated (ie, type IV delayed-type) hypersensitivity, in which sensitized T,,1
cells secrete cytokines to attract cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, is responsible for Stevens-
Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Blistering, bullae, and Nikolsky sign may
be seen, but mucosal involvement is almost always present. In addition, a preceding trigger
(eg, medication, Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection) would be expected.

(Choice C) Lipopolysaccharides (ie, endotoxin) released into the blood by gram-negative
bacteria can cause a severe, widespread inflammatory response (septic shock). Purpuric
lesions may occur with gram-negative sepsis, but Nikolsky sign would not be present.

(Choice E) Crosslinking of IgE on the cell surface causes mast cell degranulation that is
associated with allergic reactions. Urticaria (hives) appears as itchy, erythematous, blanching
papules, not diffuse erythema or desquamation.
