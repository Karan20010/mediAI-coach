(Choice A) Cutaneous infection with the mite Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies, which
manifests as intensely pruritic, excoriated papules (not lichenified plaques) in the finger webs,
wrists, axillae, and genitalia. When left untreated, the rash spreads and does not follow an
intermittent course, as in this patient.

(Choice B) Trichophyton rubrum causes tinea corporis, which presents as pruritic, scaly,
annular patches, not lichenified plaques. Untreated infection usually results in expansion or
spread of the rash.

(Choice D) Insulin-mediated keratinocyte and dermal fibroblast proliferation occurs in
acanthosis nigricans, a rash commonly involving the posterior neck that is typically seen in
insulin-resistant states (eg, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus). In contrast to the marked
pruritus seen in this case, acanthosis nigricans is asymptomatic.

(Choice E) Mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in keratinocytes (eg, from chronic sun
exposure) can lead to development of actinic keratosis, the proliferation of atypical
keratinocytes within the epidermis. Although this condition causes hyperkeratotic papules or
plaques on sun-exposed areas, lesions are typically small (<1 cm) and occur mostly in older
adults.
