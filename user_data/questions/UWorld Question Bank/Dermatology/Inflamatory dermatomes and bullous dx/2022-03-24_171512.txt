This patient developed erythema and pruritus on the scalp, face, and neck 2 days after
reexposure to hair dye. Hair products, including dye, frequently contain allergenic molecules
(eg, p-phenylenediamine) that can cause allergic contact dermatitis (ACD). ACD is a type
IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 phases:

1. Sensitization: Cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (small molecules that bind
to proteins and alter their immune appearance) and present hapten-peptide complexes to
naive CD4- and CD8- T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion of
hapten-sensitive T cells. This phase takes 10-14 days and does not result in cutaneous
lesions.

. Elicitation: On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells are recruited to skin for
activation by hapten-protein conjugates displayed on cutaneous antigen-presenting cells.
Activated CD8- T cells, the main effector cells in ACD, release cytotoxins (eg, perforin,
granzymes) and express Fas ligand to induce keratinocyte apoptosis. They also amplify
the inflammatory response by releasing cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) and recruiting
additional inflammatory cells (eg, macrophages). This phase occurs 2-3 days following
reexposure to the hapten and results in erythema, pruritus, and vesicles.
