Educational objective:

Psoriasis is characterized by hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis of the stratum
corneum, and epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with elongated rete ridges. Neutrophilic foci
in the stratum corneum and epidermis may coalesce to form microabscesses (Munro
microabscesses).
