This patient developed pruritic, erythematous blisters and erosions on the thighs following
application of a topical cream. This presentation is consistent with acute allergic contact
dermatitis (ACD), a type of eczematous dermatitis. Eczematous dermatitis is a class of skin
conditions that vary in etiology but demonstrate similar clinical findings (eg, pruritic,
erythematous, weeping papulovesicular rash) and are microscopically characterized by
spongiosis.

ACD is caused by a type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction to an external antigen (eg,
analgesic cream) on the skin surface, which incites an inflammatory response and causes
pruritus and erythema at the site of contact. Increased vascular permeability in the dermis
results in dermal edema, which can leak into the epidermis and accumulate in the intercellular
spaces (ie, spongiosis). Microscopically, spongiosis appears as increased space between
keratinocytes with prominent intercellular attachments (ie, desmosomes). Continued fluid
accumulation can break the desmosomes, causing intraepidermal vesicles.

With persistent antigen exposure, eczematous lesions may become less edematous and
weepy over time and appear as raised, thickened (ie, lichenified), scaly plaques. Histology of
chronic lesions typically shows thickening of the stratum spinosum (ie, acanthosis), stratum
granulosum (ie, hypergranulosis), and stratum corneum (ie, hyperkeratosis) (Choices A, C,
