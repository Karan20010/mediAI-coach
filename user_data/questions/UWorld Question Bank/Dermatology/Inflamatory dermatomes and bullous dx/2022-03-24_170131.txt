Educational objective:

Atopic dermatitis is characterized by epidermal barrier dysfunction due to loss-of-function
mutations in filaggrin, a key epidermal component. Increased transepidermal water loss, skin
permeability, and inflammation result in erythematous dry skin and pruritus, with chronic
disease presenting as lichenification from repeated scratching.
