central dusky area, a surrounding pale ring of edema, and a peripheral halo of erythema.
Mucosal lesions also sometimes occur.

(Choice B) Erythema nodosum is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that causes
inflammatory nodules in the subcutaneous fat. Although it can be triggered by infection,
patients generally have tender, erythematous nodules on the bilateral shins (not target-shaped

lesions).
(Choice C) Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease associated with cytokine-

driven keratinocyte hyperproliferation and parakeratosis. It usually causes erythematous,
chronic skin plaques with silvery scales on the extensor elbows, scalp, and/or knees.

(Choice D) Dermatitis herpetiformis, a manifestation of gluten sensitivity, is caused by the
subepidermal deposition of IgA. It is associated with pruritic papules and vesicles on the
forearms, knees, and/or scalp (not target-shaped lesions).

(Choice E) Urticaria is caused by the release of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators from
mast cells in the superficial dermis. Infections (eg, parasites) can cause urticaria, but patients
generally have well-circumscribed, raised, pruritic, erythematous plaques. Sometimes the
lesions have central pallor, but they are not target-shaped.
