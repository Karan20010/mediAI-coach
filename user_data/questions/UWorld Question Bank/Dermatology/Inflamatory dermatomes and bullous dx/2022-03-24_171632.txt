This patient's target-shaped skin lesions likely indicate erythema multiforme (EM), an acute,
inflammatory skin disorder that usually develops in the setting of an ongoing infection.
Although herpes simplex virus is the most common trigger, respiratory tract infections due to
Mycoplasma pneumoniae (eg, low-grade fever, headache, fatigue, cough, wheezes)
frequently cause EM in children.

EM develops when circulating pathogens are phagocytosed by peripheral mononuclear cells
and are brought to the epidermis, where DNA fragments are transferred to keratinocytes via
direct cell-to-cell spread (facilitated by upregulation of adhesion molecules). Pathogen-specific
cytotoxic T-cells then recognize foreign antigens produced by keratinocytes and initiate an
inflammatory cascade that results in epithelial damage.

Manifestations of EM include target-shaped lesions on the extremities and trunk that have a
central dusky area, a surrounding pale ring of edema, and a peripheral halo of erythema.
Mucosal lesions also sometimes occur.
