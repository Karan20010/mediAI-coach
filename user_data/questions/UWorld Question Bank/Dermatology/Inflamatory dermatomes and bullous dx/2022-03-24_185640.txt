(Choice A) Deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes within the dermal papillae is
characteristic of dermatitis herpetiformis, an autoimmune dermatitis associated with gluten
sensitivity. It typically presents as groups of pruritic papulovesicles on the extensor
extremities, scalp, back, and buttocks in patients age 40-50.

(Choice C) Deposition of IgG within the epidermal layer at the intercellular level is
characteristic of pemphigus vulgaris, which typically affects patients age 40-60 and presents
with flaccid, not tense, blisters that easily rupture, forming erosions. Absent in this patient,
mucosal involvement is almost always present in pemphigus vulgaris.

(Choice D) Disrupted assembly of keratin into monofilaments describes epidermolysis bullosa
simplex, an autosomal dominant condition presenting with blisters in areas of high friction (eg,
hands, feet, knees). Unlike BP, the condition typically presents during infancy through early
adulthood.

(Choice E) Increased vascular permeability due to gaps between endothelial cells is
characteristic of blisters associated with partial-thickness burn wounds or localized
inflammation (eg, poison ivy).
