Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of inherited disorders characterized by epithelial fragility (eg,
bullae, erosions, ulcers) triggered by minor trauma. It is caused by mutations affecting
proteins in the intraepidermal and dermoepidermal adhesion complexes; keratin mutations are
responsible for the most common form (EB simplex).
