Educational objective:

Atopic dermatitis increases the risk for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies, likely
because of an immune response that favors IgE production. In addition, skin barrier
dysfunction facilitates food allergen penetration and sensitization, increasing the risk for food

allergies.
