(Choice A) Celiac disease is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, which presents with
pruritic vesicles and plaques on the buttocks and extensor surfaces of the extremities. In
addition, this skin disorder is extremely uncommon in children.

(Choice C) Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a dendritic cell disorder that can present in infancy
or early childhood with a severe, refractory, erythematous or ulcerative rash on the scalp,
trunk, or groin. This patient's rash flares and resolves without intervention.

(Choice D) Psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis. Manifestations of psoriasis include
erythematous, well-demarcated papules and plaques with a silvery scale, which are not seen
in this patient.

(Choice E) Ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease, can be associated with
dermatologic manifestations, such as pyoderma gangrenosum (ulcerative rash) or erythema
nodosum (painful raised red nodules). Both are uncommon in children, and neither is seen in
this case.
