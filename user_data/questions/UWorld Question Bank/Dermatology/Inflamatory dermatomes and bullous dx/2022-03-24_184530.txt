A 52-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 2-month history of oral lesions that cause
pain with chewing and swallowing food. The patient did not seek treatment because she
thought the lesions would go away on their own, but they have persisted. On examination,
there are erosions of the buccal and gingival mucosa, as shown in the image below. There are
several flaccid bullae with erosions scattered over her trunk. The blisters spread laterally with
12 pressure, and traction on seemingly uninvolved skin produces blistering. Autoantibodies
directed against which of the following structures are most likely responsible for this process?
