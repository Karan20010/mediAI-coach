The pathogenesis of DH is associated with that of celiac disease. Following absorption of
dietary gluten, gliadin is deaminated by tissue transglutaminase in a process involving
formation of covalent crosslinks between the two. Because of this, the subsequent immune
response against gliadin also targets tissue transglutaminase, leading to the production of IgA
and IgG tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies. In the skin, these antibodies cross-react
with epidermal transglutaminase, and the resulting inflammation leads to the characteristic
manifestations of DH.

The majority of patients with DH exhibit the small-bowel histologic findings of celiac disease,
which include:

¢ Small bowel intraepithelial lymphocytosis
¢ Crypt hyperplasia (elongation)
e Progressive villous atrophy (height shrinkage)
