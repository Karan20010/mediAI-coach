the shins and ankles. Shave biopsy reveals prominent hyperkeratosis along with a thickened
granular layer. In addition, there is a bandlike infiltrate of mononuclear cells (predominantly
lymphocytes) in the subjacent superficial dermis that involves the overlying epidermis. The
rete ridges have a sharpened, sawtooth appearance. The basal layer of the epidermis is
degenerated, with scattered colloid bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
