(Choice A) Chronic topical corticosteroid therapy can cause atrophy, not hyperplasia, of
subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle layers.

(Choices C and F) Dermal perivascular lymphocytosis is characteristic of the initial stage of
acute atopic dermatitis. Epidermal intercellular edema (ie, spongiosis) is also seen in acute
atopic dermatitis and manifests clinically as small vesicles. However, given that the patient is
asymptomatic with treatment, these findings would not be expected.

(Choices D and E) Epidermal hyperkeratosis (ie, thickening of the stratum corneum) and
epidermal hyperplasia (ie, increased cellularity in the stratum spinosum) are characteristic of
chronic atopic dermatitis, which manifests with scales and lichenification. Neither finding is
present in this patient.
