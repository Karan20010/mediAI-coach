This patient with a pruritic, lichenified plaque on the posterior neck most likely has chronic
atopic dermatitis (eczema), a common inflammatory condition that begins in infancy or early
childhood and often flares with low humidity (eg, winter months) or excessive heat. The
pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and includes immune dysfunction (eg, a Th2-
skewed response) and genetically mediated epidermal barrier dysfunction.

Of the epidermal components, filaggrin is thought to play a key role in maintaining skin barrier
function. Loss-of-function mutations result in decreased natural moisturizing factors, impaired
keratin filament aggregation, and decreased tight junction expression. These changes result
in loss of epidermal water content, increased permeability to environmental
allergens/irritants, and skin inflammation.

Clinical findings in acute atopic dermatitis include intensely pruritic, dry, erythematous papules
and/or vesicles; histologic findings include spongiosis (ie, epidermal intercellular edema), as
well as T-cell, eosinophil, and mast cell infiltration. In contrast, chronic lesions present with
lichenified plaques due to repetitive scratching, corresponding to regions of hyperkeratosis
(epidermal thickening) with elongated rete ridges.
