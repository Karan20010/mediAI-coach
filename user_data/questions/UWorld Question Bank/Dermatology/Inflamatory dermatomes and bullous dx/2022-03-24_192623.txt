(Choice A) Tyrosinase is the primary enzyme responsible for oxidation of tyrosine, which
serves as the rate-limiting step in synthesis of melanin. Tyrosinase inhibitors (eg,
hydroquinone) decrease synthesis of melanin and can be used in treatment of
hyperpigmentation disorders (eg, melasma).

(Choice B) Acne vulgaris is promoted by proinflammatory fatty acid production by
Cutibacterium (Propionibacterium) acnes. Benzoyl peroxide has bacteriostatic properties
against C acnes and reduces production of these inflammatory fatty acids.

(Choice C) Cutaneous warts are the most common manifestation of human papillomavirus
infection. Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulator that likely induces local cytokine (eg,
interferon-alpha, interleukin-6) production against the virus.

(Choice D) Prostaglandin E, (which is produced by cyclooxygenase-2) is involved in
mediating the tumorigenic effects of ultraviolet light in the skin, promoting the formation of
actinic keratosis (AK) and squamous cell carcinoma. Topical diclofenac, a nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase, can be used to treat AK.

Educational objective:
First-line treatment options for localized psoriasis include high-potency topical corticosteroids
