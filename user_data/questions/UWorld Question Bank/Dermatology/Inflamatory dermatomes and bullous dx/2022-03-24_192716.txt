(Choice A) Atopic dermatitis can present with erythematous, scaly plaques, but it is more
common in flexural areas, shows less prominent scaling, and is usually associated with more
prominent itching.

(Choice B) Cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris) are caused by human papillomavirus infection
and present as discrete, hyperkeratotic papules. Although patients can have multiple warts,
numerous scaly plaques are more consistent with psoriasis.

(Choice C) Lichen planus presents with pink or purple plaques and papules. It is usually
associated with severe pruritis and typically affects the volar surface of the wrists rather than
the dorsum of the hands.

(Choice E) Tinea manuum presents with scaly plaques on the hands. The lesions are
typically very pruritic and often have an annular appearance with central clearing.
