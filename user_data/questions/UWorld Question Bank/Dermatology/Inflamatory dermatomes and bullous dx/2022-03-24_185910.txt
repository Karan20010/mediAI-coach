(Choices A and B) Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies
against hemidesmosomes and is characterized by tense, subepidermal blisters. Pemphigus
vulgaris is characterized by intraepithelial cleavage and is due to autoantibodies against
desmosomes (desmogleins 1 and 3); it presents with flaccid bullae, desquamation, and oral
ulcerations. Both disorders cause scattered or widespread (rather than localized) lesions and
are uncommon in children.

(Choice D) Atopic dermatitis is associated with mutations in epidermal barrier proteins,
leading to increased exposure to environmental antigens and immune hypersensitivity. It
typically presents in infants and young children with erythematous papules and plaques
involving the head, trunk, and extensor surfaces, and in older children and adults with
lichenification in a flexural distribution (eg, neck, wrists, antecubital and popliteal fossae).

(Choice E) Herpes simplex virus infection is characterized by recurrent clusters of
mucocutaneous papules and vesicles that evolve into ulcerated and crusted lesions. It
typically causes localized perioral or genital lesions rather than involving large regions on the
extremities.
