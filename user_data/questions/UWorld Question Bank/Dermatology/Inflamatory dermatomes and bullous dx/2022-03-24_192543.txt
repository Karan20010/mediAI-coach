This patient has psoriasis, a common skin disorder characterized by activation of T helper
cells and proliferation of keratinocytes. Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) produces
erythematous plaques, and hyperkeratosis and confluent parakeratosis of the stratum
corneum produce the characteristic scaling. The epidermal cell layer superficial to the dermal
papillae may be thinned and contain dilated blood vessels, which can lead to pinpoint
bleeding when the scale is removed (Auspitz sign).

First-line treatment options for localized psoriasis include topical corticosteroids (eg,
diflorasone) and vitamin D analogs (eg, calcipotriene, calcitriol). Vitamin D analogs activate
the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear transcription factor, resulting in inhibition of T-cell and
keratinocyte proliferation and stimulation of keratinocyte differentiation. Corticosteroids also
have anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties; their mechanism of action is
complementary to vitamin D analogs, and the 2 agents work well in combination.
