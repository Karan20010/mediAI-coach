(Choice A) Lichen planus is characterized by band-like lymphocytic inflammation near the
dermoepidermal junction as well as sawtooth-shaped rete ridges, hypergranulosis (ie,
thickened granular layer), and hyperkeratosis. It typically presents with pruritic purple papules,
frequently on the wrists and ankles.

(Choice C) A granuloma is a nodular, inflammatory structure composed of aggregates of
epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells. They are seen in a variety of
infectious (eg, tuberculosis) and autoimmune (eg, sarcoidosis) diseases but are not seen in
psoriasis.

(Choice D) Eosinophilic infiltrates are a common finding in pemphigus vulgaris, bullous
pemphigoid, eczematous skin diseases (eg, atopic eczema, allergic contact dermatitis), and
dermatitis herpetiformis. These disorders generally present with vesicle or bulla formation,
fragility of the skin, and often intense itching. Plaques and scaling, when present, are mainly
due to persistent scratching.

(Choice E) Actinic keratosis is characterized by squamous dysplasia and hyperkeratosis and
is considered a premalignant lesion to squamous cell carcinoma. It is typically related to
chronic ultraviolet exposure and commonly presents as a rough, scaly, erythematous lesion on

sun-exposed areas (eg, face, dorsum of hands).
