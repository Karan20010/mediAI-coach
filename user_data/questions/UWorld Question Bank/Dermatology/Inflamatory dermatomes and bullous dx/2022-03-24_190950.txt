(Choice A) Kawasaki disease, a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, is associated with coronary
artery aneurysms. Patients have a polymorphous rash, in addition to fever, mucocutaneous
inflammation, cervical lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes (eg, edema), none of which

are seen in this case.

(Choice B) Disabling arthritis can be associated with plaque psoriasis, which classically
presents with thick, silvery scales involving the knees, elbows, scalp, and lower back, features
not seen in this patient.

(Choice D) Proximal muscle weakness is characteristic of juvenile dermatomyositis, which
can cause facial erythema but classically presents with a heliotrope rash on the upper eyelids.
In addition, the onset typically occurs in school-aged children, not infants.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 can cause transient anemia due to viral destruction of erythrocyte
progenitor cells, typically in patients with red blood cell disorders (eg, sickle cell anemia).

Initial symptoms include a nonspecific prodrome (eg, fever, coryza), followed by a nonpruritic,
malar rash (ie, slapped cheeks) in school-aged children. This patient's age, lack of prodromal

symptoms, and pruritus make this diagnosis unlikely.
