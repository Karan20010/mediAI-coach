A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother due to a rash that started 3 days ago. A
similar red, itchy rash on the cheeks, trunk, and arms has occurred intermittently since

infancy. The mother had thought that the rashes were related to the consumption of certain
foods, but elimination of cow's milk and fruits did not improve the rash. The patient has had a
few upper respiratory infections but no major illnesses. Vaccinations are up to date, and he
takes no medications. He attends a day care facility. Vital signs are within normal limits. The
rash on the patient's back is shown in the exhibit. Similar findings are observed on the cheeks
and proximal upper extremities. The diaper area is clear, and no mucosal lesions are present.
This patient's current condition increases his risk of developing which of the following
additional disorders?

A. Celiac disease (11%)
YB. Asthma (73%)
C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (5%)

D. Psoriatic arthritis (7%)

E. Ulcerative colitis (1%)
