This elderly patient has the typical features of bullous pemphigoid (BP), an autoimmune
blistering disease. BP most commonly affects individuals age >60 and is more common in
those with neurologic disorders (eg, Alzheimer dementia). As in this patient, bullae are
typically tense and have erythematous or normal-appearing bases. Lesion distribution can be
localized or diffuse, involving the trunk and extremities; mucosal involvement is rare.

BP is caused by antibodies against hemidesmosomes along the basement membrane of the
dermal-epidermal junction. These autoantibodies result in a destructive inflammatory
cascade that causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal
blisters. Immunofluorescence shows IgG and/or C3 deposits in a linear pattern along the
basement membrane.
