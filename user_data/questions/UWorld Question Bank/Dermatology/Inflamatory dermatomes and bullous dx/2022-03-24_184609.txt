This patient has pemphigus vulgaris (PV), an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by
painful, flaccid bullae and erosions of the skin and mucosal membranes. Any mucosal site
can be involved, but the oral mucosa is the most common. The bullae are structurally weak
and often rupture prior to presentation, with only erosions remaining. The bullae spread
laterally when pressure is applied on top (ie, Asboe-Hansen sign), and new blisters may form
with gentle traction or rubbing (ie, Nikolsky sign).

The underlying pathophysiology of PV involves autoantibodies directed against desmosomes,
specifically desmogleins 1 and 3, which disrupt cohesion of keratinocytes. Biopsy of an
active PV lesion will show intraepithelial cleavage with detached keratinocytes
(acantholysis), retained keratinocytes along the basement membrane and an eosinophilic
inflammatory infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence of unaffected skin adjacent to PV lesions
will show epidermal intercellular IgG and C3 deposits. Circulating autoantibodies against
desmogleins are present in many patients and can aid diagnosis.
