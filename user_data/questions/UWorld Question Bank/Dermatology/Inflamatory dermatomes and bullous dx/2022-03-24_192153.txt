Urticaria ("hives") is a common, transient hypersensitivity disorder characterized by
intensely pruritic, raised, erythematous plaques (wheals) that arise suddenly and resolve over
several hours. They are most often caused by IgE-mediated degranulation of mast cells.
They can also be due to non-IgE-mediated degranulation (eg, opiates, radiocontrast agents,
physical urticaria) or mast cell-independent mechanisms (eg, aspirin, hereditary angioneurotic
edema).

Urticaria is due to increased permeability of the microvasculature, leading to edema of the
superficial dermis. Involvement of the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue is termed
angioedema. Biopsy is rarely required for diagnosis. Findings on histopathology would
typically include a mixed inflammatory infiltrate (mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and
eosinophils) surrounding superficial dermal venules. Lymphatic channels may be engorged
with transudative fluid. The overlying epidermis typically appears normal.
