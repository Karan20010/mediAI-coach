Scabies is a skin infection caused by the human itch mite, Sarcoptes scabiei. Transmission
occurs from prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual but may occasionally
occur due to contact with contaminated fomites (eg, bedsheets, clothing). Mites burrow
under the epidermis and evoke a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to mite feces and
eggs, which leads to an intensely pruritic rash. The mites can often be seen on microscopy.
