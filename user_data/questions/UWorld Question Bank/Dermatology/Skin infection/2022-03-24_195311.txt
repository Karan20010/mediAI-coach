Educational objective:

Scabies is a highly contagious disease that presents with an intensely pruritic rash (usually
worse at night) involving the flexor surfaces of the wrist, lateral surfaces and webs of the
fingers, elbow extensor surfaces, and axillary folds. Patients usually have excoriations with
small, crusted, red papules scattered around the affected areas. Diagnosis is confirmed by
skin scrapings from excoriated lesions that show mites, ova, and feces under light microscopy.
