(Choice A) Cutaneous candidiasis (eg, intertrigo) is an inflammatory condition involving
approximated skin surfaces such as the axillae, groin, inframammary folds, or abdominal
folds. Candida albicans is a commensal organism that is normally present on the skin and can
become invasive if there is disruption in the normal skin barrier.

(Choice B) Sunburn presents with erythema, itching, and pain in sun-exposed areas.
Sunburned skin may undergo superficial desquamation (peeling), but this patient's rounded
lesions with peripheral scaling are more consistent with tinea corporis.

(Choice C) Patients with untreated streptococcal pharyngitis can develop erythema
marginatum, a fleeting pink or red rash with central clearing that can appear, disappear, and
reappear within hours. This is a hallmark feature of rheumatic fever and is usually
accompanied by other signs such as migratory arthritis, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, and

Sydenham chorea.

(Choice E) Acute Lyme disease is characterized by flu-like symptoms and erythema migrans,
a slowly spreading erythematous rash with central clearing at the site of the tick bite.
Disseminated disease can present with multiple lesions, but the lesions are flat or only slightly
raised and the border is indistinct rather than scaly; they often develop a targetoid appearance.
