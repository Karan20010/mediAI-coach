Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues characterized by
progressive skin erythema, warmth, and tenderness. Many patients also have associated
fever, leukocytosis, and localized lymphadenopathy. Most cases are driven by disruptions to
the skin barrier due to minor trauma, lymphedema, or dermatophytic infection, which allow a
portal of entry for bacteria.

Cases of cellulitis are generally divided as follows:

¢ Nonpurulent cellulitis is characterized by skin warmth, edema, and erythema with no
fluctuant nodules. It is most often caused by beta-hemolytic streptococci (groups A, B,
C, G, and F); group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes) accounts for the majority of
cases.

¢ Purulent cellulitis is characterized by a painful, fluctuant nodule in the dermis or
subcutaneous tissue with or without surrounding erythema. The most common cause is
Staphylococcus aureus; strains that express the virulence factor Panton-Valentine
leukocidin are particularly likely to cause skin abscess.
