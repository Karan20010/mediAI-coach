Human hookworms (eg, Necator americanus, A duodenale) penetrate the basement
membrane and spread from the dermis to the bloodstream. They rupture into the alveoli
and are coughed up and swallowed into the small intestine. There, larvae mature into
adult hookworms that feed on blood from the duodenal mucosa (often causing iron
deficiency anemia) and shed up to 10,000 eggs/day, thereby spreading the infection to
others.

Cat and dog hookworms (eg, Ancylostoma braziliense, A caninum) cause a dermal
eruption in humans but are unable to penetrate the cutaneous basement membrane and
spread to deeper tissues. Therefore, larvae do not mature into adult hookworms or spread
from human-to-human (humans are incidental hosts).
