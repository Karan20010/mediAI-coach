Leprosy (Hansen disease), a deforming infection primarily of the skin and nerves, is caused
by Mycobacterium leprae. Transmission is promoted in unhygienic conditions and likely
occurs through the respiratory route, with some organisms being transmitted through
prolonged direct skin-to-skin contact. Infection has also been associated with armadillo
contact in the southwestern United States. The range of clinical manifestations depends on
the strength of the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response.
