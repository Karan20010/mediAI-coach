This patient has a vesicular rash consistent with herpes zoster (shingles), which is caused by
reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. Following the primary infection
(chickenpox), VZV remains dormant in the dorsal root ganglia until emerging decades later.
Decreased cell-mediated immunity (eg, older age, immunosuppressive medications, HIV
infection) increases the risk of reactivation.

Reactivation of VZV causes hemorrhagic inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion and
peripheral nerve. The resulting hypersensitive nerve function presents with neuropathic pain
in the affected region (herpetic neuralgia), typically described as stabbing, tingling, or burning.
Herpetic neuralgia can begin even before the appearance of skin lesions and may persist for
up to several months. A minority of patients experience long-term residual pain, termed
postherpetic neuralgia; the risk is greater in older patients (age >70) and those with more

severe shingles.
