(Choice A) Intraepidermal fracturing (acantholysis) and formation of multinucleated cells are
seen in herpes simplex labialis. Although this condition is often found on the lips and perioral
skin, it presents with acute/recurrent blisters and ulcers.

(Choice C) Impetigo is a gram-positive skin infection that generates a neutrophilic infiltrate. It
presents with erythema, blistering, and shallow ulcers with honey-colored crusts.

(Choice D) Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder associated with antibodies against
hemidesmosomes, leading to subepidermal complement activation and cleavage. It is most
common at age >60 and typically presents with pruritic plaques, erosions, and tense bullae.
