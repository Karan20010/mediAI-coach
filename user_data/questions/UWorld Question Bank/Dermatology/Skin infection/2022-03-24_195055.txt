Educational objective:

Herpes zoster (shingles) develops due to reactivation of varicella zoster virus in the dorsal root
ganglia (sensory neurons). It presents with a painful vesicular rash in a dermatomal
distribution. Intranuclear inclusions in keratinocytes and multinucleated giant cells are seen on

light microscopy.
