This patient with extensive animal exposure and scratch marks on her arm likely has cat-
scratch disease (cat-scratch fever), a condition caused by Bartonella henselae. This
organism resides in the oral cavity of cats and is transmitted to humans by cat scratches and
bites. Typically, a primary inoculation lesion evolves from vesicular to erythematous to
papular, followed by the development of tender regional lymphadenopathy (often involving a
single lymph node) proximal to the lesion. Axillary lymphadenopathy is extremely common.

B henselae can also cause bacillary angiomatosis (BA) in immunocompromised patients.
BA presents with red-purple papular skin lesions. These vascular proliferations may also be
found within the viscera. BA can be fatal if left untreated.
