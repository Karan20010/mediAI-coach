This immunosuppressed patient has febrile neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of
0.60 x 800 = 480/mm.:, likely in the setting of chemotherapy) and sepsis. With neutropenia
(typically ANC <500/mms), there is increased susceptibility to infections with gram-negative
organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The dermatologic lesions in this patient are
consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum (EG), which is strongly associated with P
aeruginosa bacteremia.

Perivascular bacterial invasion of arteries and veins in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue,
with subsequent release of exotoxins destructive to human tissue, leads to characteristic skin
patches exhibiting necrosis and ulceration as a result of insufficient blood flow. P
aeruginosa virulence factors that may contribute to EG include exotoxin A (protein synthesis
inhibition), elastase (degrades elastin - important for blood vessel destruction), phospholipase
C (degrades cellular membranes), and pyocyanin (generates reactive oxygen species).

Although gram-negative sepsis is sometimes associated with disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC) and resultant purpuric skin lesions, DIC is unlikely given the normal platelet
count and coagulation times (prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times).
