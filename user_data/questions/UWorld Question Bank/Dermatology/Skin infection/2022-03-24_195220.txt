Question Id: 10168

A 60-year-old woman comes to the physician with 10 days of diffuse itching. Arash began on
her hands and quickly spread to involve her wrists, arms, and axillae. She has difficulty
sleeping and complains of intense itching in these areas. She works in a day care center and
primarily takes care of children age 2-5. The patient has no other medical conditions and
takes no chronic medications. Vital signs are normal. Her BMI is 24 kg/m2. Skin examination
shows small erythematous papules on the palms with excoriations, scattered vesicles, and
pustules on the finger webs, palms, and wrist creases, as seen in the image below. She has
similar lesions in her axillary skin folds bilaterally. The remainder of the examination is within
normal limits.
