Pediculus humanus capitis (ie, head lice) infestation is common in school children and adults
who come into close contact with infested individuals. Transmission is usually by direct
contact. The eggs (nits) are attached to the hair shaft and can be identified on inspection.
First-line treatment includes topical pediculicides (eg, permethrin, ivermectin).
