Educational objective:

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a cutaneous necrotic disease with a strong association with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia. It occurs from perivascular invasion and release of
tissue-destructive exotoxins, causing vascular destruction and insufficient blood flow to
patches of skin that become edematous and subsequently necrose. Pseudomonas infections
are common in patients who are neutropenic, are hospitalized, have burns, or have indwelling
catheters.
