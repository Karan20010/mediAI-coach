Educational objective:

The severity of leprosy, a systemic illness caused by Mycobacterium leprae, depends on the
strength of the cell-mediated immune (CMI) response, with tuberculoid leprosy representing
the milder form (intact Th1 CMI response) and lepromatous leprosy, the more severe form

(weak CMI response).
