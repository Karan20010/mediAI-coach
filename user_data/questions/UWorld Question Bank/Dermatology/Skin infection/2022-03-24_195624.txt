A 68-year-old woman comes to the office for evaluation of a skin rash. The patient says that
red, painful papules erupted on her right chest 5 days ago and quickly turned into vesicles
containing clear fluid. The lesions are now beginning to crust and are less painful. She has
never had similar lesions and does not recall coming into contact with a person having a
similar illness. Medical history is significant only for well-controlled hypertension. Physical
examination shows a grouped vesicular rash involving the right T4 dermatome that is
beginning to heal with crusting. The rash does not cross the midline. Lightly touching the skin
elicits sharp pain. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. This patient is
at greatest risk of developing which of the following complications as a result of her current
condition?

A. Dissemination of rash to other body areas (3%)
B. Painful swelling of the large joints (3%)

Y/Y C. Persistent pain in the affected region (85%)
D. Recurrent episodes of gross hematuria (1%)

E. Sensory loss in "glove and stocking" pattern (6%)
