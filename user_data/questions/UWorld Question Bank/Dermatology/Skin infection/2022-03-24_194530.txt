This patient has a common cutaneous wart (ie, verruca vulgaris). Cutaneous warts are
caused by human papillomavirus, which also causes anogenital warts (ie, condyloma
acuminata). The virus is usually transmitted by direct contact and is most common in children,
adolescents, and young adults.

Cutaneous warts typically present as skin-colored papules or well-circumscribed plaques.
They may also form complex filiform lesions. On the palms or soles (ie, palmar, plantar warts),
they commonly present as tender plaques or nodules that disrupt the normal skin striae.

The diagnosis of cutaneous warts is often apparent based on gross findings. Key findings on
magnified view (ie, dermoscopy) include a roughened surface and small black dots
representing thrombosed capillaries. Biopsy is usually not needed but can confirm the
diagnosis in atypical cases. Histopathologic findings include:

¢ Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with eosinophilic inclusions and keratohyaline
granules

¢ Thickened stratum corneum (hyperkeratosis)

¢ Papilloma formation

e Perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolization (koilocytosis)
