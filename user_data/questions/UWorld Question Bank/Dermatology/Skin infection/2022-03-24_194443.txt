¢ Inhibition of angiogenesis by downregulating proangiogenic factors (eg, fibroblast
growth factor) and upregulating angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, interferon-gamma, IL-12)
(Choice A) Calcipotriene is a vitamin D analog (ie, activates the vitamin D receptor, a nuclear

transcription factor) used to treat plaque psoriasis. It acts by inhibiting T-cell and keratinocyte
proliferation and stimulating keratinocyte differentiation.

(Choice C) Pimecrolimus is a calcineurin inhibitor used to treat atopic dermatitis (eczema). It
acts by blocking the translocation of NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), resulting in
reduced transcription of IL-2.

(Choice D) Topical salicylic acid is a keratolytic agent that acts by increasing sloughing of
virus-infected epidermal cells. It is widely used to treat common warts but is not
recommended for anogenital warts.

(Choice E) Silver nitrate is a caustic agent that coagulates cellular proteins to form an
eschar. It is used to cauterize wounds to stop bleeding (eg, epistaxis) and to remove excess
granulation tissue.
