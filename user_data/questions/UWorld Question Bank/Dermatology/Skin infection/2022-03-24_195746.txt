Pityriasis versicolor (also called tinea versicolor) is characterized by hypopigmented,
hyperpigmented, or erythematous macules or patches on the upper body. It is caused by
Malassezia species yeasts, and the infection is confined to the stratum corneum of the skin.
It is common in areas with hot and humid climates and is often most visible after extensive
sun exposure due to tanning of the adjacent skin. Most cases of pityriasis versicolor occur
in healthy individuals with no underlying immunologic deficiencies.

The diagnosis of pityriasis versicolor is made by potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of
skin scrapings. Malassezia forms spores and hyphae, producing the characteristic "spaghetti
and meatballs" appearance on light microscopy. The hyphae have a short, "cigar-butt"
appearance. This condition is treated with topical antifungal agents or selenium-containing

shampoo.
