No change\nE. No change\nno change\nThe Correct Answer is ! A) k\\yocardiaI Oxygen Consumption \\, Coronary Blood Plow\nDuring exercise, the heart works harder to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the working muscles.

      "content": "The correct answer is C. Both myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow increase.\n\nWhen exercising intensively, the heart works harder to deliver blood and oxygen to working muscles. As a result, myocardial oxygen consumption increases to meet the higher metabolic demands of the heart muscle. To fulfill the increased oxygen demand, coronary blood flow also increases, ensuring the heart muscle receives sufficient oxygen supply. Therefore, both the myocardial oxygen consumption and coronary blood flow increase during intensive exercise."
