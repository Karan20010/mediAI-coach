The FRC is the amount of air that remains in be lungs at\\er a normal exhalation and is a measure of the lung's ability to store air. On the pressure-volume graph, the FRC is the volume at which the pressure in be lung is eQual to the pressure in the chest wall. as indicated by be intersection of the solid and dashed curves at point B. The FRC is determined by be elastic properties of the lung and chest wall and the Surface tension of be alveolar fluid, and it is an important factor in determining the lung's ability a exchange gases\n\nRelevant textbook excerpts:\n"

B\nA Ilcnv-volixne loop is a graphics representation of the relalionsh@ between airflow' and lung volume during a breathing maneuver, such as a forced mpiration. The kx\u203ap is aeated by plotting the Ilcnv rate of ar being exhaled (in liters pe secnnd) m the x-axis and the lung volume (n liters) m the y-axis.\nPeak expiratory flcnv (PEF) is the maximum IJow rate achieved during a f\u2039xced expiralion and is a commorJy used measicernent of lung kinclion. In the Row'-volume k\u203aop, the PEF is represented by the point of maximum slope on the exhaled Row' traoe, which is Point\u201dB\u201d. This point re{xesents the highest flow rate achieved during the foroed exp?ation, and is a good indicator of the overall health of the respiratory system.\n\nWhich of the following is most likely to cause the change from the solid curve to the dashed curve of the pressure - volume loop shown?\nacute mass lve myocardial inla rction\n.\temorrnaglc enock\nThe Correct Answer is ! E. Strenu ous exerc ise\nStrenuous exercise is most likely to fuse be change from be solid curve to the dashed curve of the pressure-volume loop shown. where end-diastolic volume {EDV) increased, pressure increased. and stroke volume (SV) increased. During exercise. the body demands more oxygen and nutrients. leading to an increase in cardiac ou@ut. The heart adapts by increasing the convaclility. heart rate. and stroke volume.\nThis resuTW in a higher end-diasOIic volume and pressure, leading to the observed change in be pressure-\nvolume loop.\n\ndifficulty urinating.

      "content": "The gastrointestinal (GI) system, also known as the digestive system, is responsible for breaking down food, absorbing nutrients, and expelling waste from the body. It extends from the mouth to the anus and includes several organs.\n\n1. **Mouth & Salivary Glands**: The process of digestion begins in your mouth, where food is mixed with saliva.\n\n2. **Esophagus**: A muscular tube that connects the throat to the stomach. It is responsible for transporting food to the stomach.\n\n3. **Stomach**: A muscular organ that stores and helps break down food. Food is physically broken down by the churning motion. Gastric juice (hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes) chemically breaks down food into a more digestible form.\n\n4. **Small Intestine**: Where most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. It has three sections: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Key nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream here.\n\n5. **Large Intestine (colon)**: Absorbs water and remnants of digestive juice, breaks down undigested fiber and other indigestible substances by bacteria, and stores feces ready for expulsion. It is also divided into sections: ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and rectum.\n\n6. **Rectum and Anus**: Serve as storage for waste before it leaves the body.\n\nIn addition to these organs, the GI tract also includes the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. These release substances such as bile and pancreatic juice into the small intestine, aiding in digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins.\n\nFlashcard style question:\n\nWhich section of the GI tract is responsible for most nutrient absorption?\nThe Correct Answer is: Small intestine\n\nThe small intestine is the location where most digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs. It has a large surface area (due to villi and microvilli) that aids in absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream."
