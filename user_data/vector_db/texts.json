Which of the following vectors is the most likely source of infection in this patient?\nBody louse\nKissing bug\nSandfly\nTsetse fly\nThe Correct Answer is : C. Mosquito\nThe patient's symptoms of headache, fever, and shaking chills along with his recent travel to southern Mexico, are suggestive of malaria. Malaria is caused by Plasmodium species, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes.",
    "A 67-year-old man comes to the physician because of numbness in his hands and feet for 3 months. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) deficiency is suspected. An increased serum concentration of which of the following is\t likely to confirm the diagnosis?\nAcetoacetate\nAlanine\nLeucine\nMethionine\nF. lactate\nThe Correct Answer is : E. Methylmalonate\nVitamin B12 deficiency can be confirmed by an increased serum concentration of methylmalonate. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor for the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. In the case of vitamin B12 deficiency this conversion is impaired, leading to an accumulation of methylmalonate in the serum.\nA 35-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after fainting while at work. He is conscious and is able to state his name and what he was doing before the episode. He says that he has had fatigue during the past 3 weeks. He has no history of major medical illness and takes no medications. His mother died of ovarian cancer at the age of 40 years. His maternal grandfather died of colon cancer at the age of 49 years. The patient does not smoke or drink alcoholic beverages. He\nappears pale. His temperature is 3z\toc ( 9.5\u00b0F), pulse is 110/min, respirations are",

MSH2\nThe patient's family history of early-onset ovarian and colon cancers suggests the possibility of Lynch syndrome (also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC). This condition is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, most commonly MSH2 and MLH1.\nImmunohistochemistry of the biopsy specimen would most likely show loss of expression of MSH2 in this case.\nA 56-year-old woman comes to the physician because of progressive shortness of breath and cough during the past 2 weeks.

    "Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of the findings in this patient?\nMetastatic carcinoma to the lung\nPulmonary tuberculosis\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nThoracic duct obstruction\nBacterial pneumonia\nThe Correct Answer is : A. Congestive heart failure\nThe patient's pleural fluid analysis results are consistent with a transudative pleural effusion, which has low protein and cell counts. Congestive heart failure is the most common cause of transudative pleural effusions. The translucent, mildly yellow appearance and low specific gravity also support this diagnosis.",
    "An investigator is studying the cellular responses that follow different types of injury to the liver. In the experimental model, animals are exposed to a toxin that kills 50% of the hepatocytes, but spares injury to the basement membrane and underlying extracellular matrix of the liver. The cellular response to this injury will primarily occur via which of the following mechanisms?\nActivation of liver stem cells\nIncreased production of extracellular matrix\nlngroMh of granulation tissue into the liver\nRecruitment of fibroblasts to the liver\nThe Correct Answer is : B. Entry of hepatocytes into the cell cycle\nFollowing liver injury that spares the basement membrane and underlying extracellular matrix, hepatocytes will enter the cell cycle to regenerate and replace the damaged cells. This process is known as compensatory hyperplasia. The liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate itself and hepatocytes can rapidly proliferate in response to injury or loss of liver tissue.",
    "A 26-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after a neighbor found her lying unresponsive on her kitchen floor. She is pronounced dead on arrival. She had no history of any major medical illness. At autopsy, the liver size is two- thirds normal with a wrinkled capsule and soft, hyperemic parenchyma. A photomicrograph of a section of the liver is shown. The hepatic changes ale most suggestive of which of the following types of damage?\nDrug toxicity\nNeoplasia\nRadiation Injury\nTrauma\nThe Correct Answer is : B. Hypoxia\nThe description of the liver (smaller in size, wrinkled capsule, soft, hyperemic parenchyma, and bubbling cells) is most suggestive of hypoxic damage. Hypoxia refers to a state in which there is a lack of oxygen supply to the tissue. This can result from various causes, such as cardiac arrest, respiratory failure, or carbon monoxide poisoning, leading to cellular damage and eventually tissue death.\nAn 84-year-old man is brought to the emergency department 30 minutes after an episode of syncope. Transthoracic echocardiography shows a 4-cm",

When making the incision into the left atrium to remove the myxoma, which of the following regions of the interatrial septum should be avoided in order to prevent injury to the cardiac conduction system?\nCrista terminall9\nFO99a OValis region\nPosteroliderlor region above the opening of the coronary sinus\nE. superoposterior region posterior to the fo99a OValis\nThe Correct Answer is : D. Superoanterior region above the limbus of the fossa ovalis\nThe incision should avoid the superoanterior region above the limbus of the fossa ovalis to prevent injury to the cardiac condu ion system. The atrioventricular (AV) node is located in this region and can be injured if the incision is made too close.\nA 68-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination after a routine endoscopy for dyspepsia showed large esophageal varices. She has a\n25-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. She also has hypertension and hyperlipidemia. She does not have any history of liver disease, blood transfusions, or intravenous drug use, and she does not drink alcohol. Her current medications are\n81-mg aspirin, insulin, lisinopril, and simvastatin. She appears alert. She is 168 cm (5 ft 6 in) tall and weighs 110 kg (242 lb); BMI is 39\t Physical examination shows scattered spider angiomata over the chest and upper extremities. Abdominal examination shows no ascites. The spleen tip is palpated 4 cm below the left costal margin.

    "Ultrasonography shows coarsened liver echotexture with increased echogenicity. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the liver findings in this patient?\nAdverse drug ef1ect\nChronic hepatitis\nHepatolenticular degeneration (Wilson disease)\nPrior excessive alcohol use\nThe Correct Answer is : C. Fatty liver\nThis patient has a history of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are all risk factors for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The coarsened liver echotexture with increased echogenicity on ultrasonography is consistent with fatty liver. The other options are less likely given the patient's medical history and laboratory findings.\nA 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 4-month history of progressive shortness of breath and left-sided chest pain; he also has had an unintentional 11-kg (25-lb) weight loss during this period.

Mesothelial cells\nThe presence of cytologically malignant cells expressing calretinin in the pleural fluid suggests a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. Mesotheliomas originate from mesothelial cells, which line the pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial cavities.",
    "A 63-year-old man with a long history of sun exposure develops the skin lesion shown. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\nActinic keratosis\nseborrheic keratosis\nMalignant melanoma\nsquamous cell carcinoma\nThe Correct Answer is : B. Basal cell carcinoma\nGiven the age of the patient, long history of sun exposure and the description of the skin lesion as a pearly, translucent or waxy bump the most likely diagnosis is:\nB) Basal cell carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer and is often associated with sun exposure. BCC typically presents as a pearly translucent, or waxy bump, often with visible blood vessels. It is a slow-growing cancer that rarely spreads to other parts of the body but can be locally invasive and cause damage to surrounding tissues if left untreated.",
    "A 54-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife 2 hours after the onset of severe chest pain. After being evaluated by the physician, he is told that he has had an acute myocardial infarction. While the physician is explaining the diagnosis, the patient exclaims, \"I knew it I knew it! I'm going to die. My wife will be a widow. My kids will go hungry and be homeless.\" After acknowledging that he understands the patient's concerns, it is most appropriate for the physician to state which of the following?\n+\u2022\u2022+\u2022=+\u2022\u2039\u2022z\u2022\u2022\nB\"R.ight now, it's really important that you think positively and keep your spirits up.\"\n\"We have some literature available to you that will help you cope with your diagnosis.\"\n\"Would you like to speak with your wife about these fears that you are having?\"\n\"You need to calm down so that I can explain your situation and potential treatment options more fully.\"\nThe Correct Answer is : A. \"Being sick can be very frightening, especially when you have people who depend on you\"\nEmpathizing with the patient and acknowledging his concerns is the most appropriate approach in this situation.

    "In the prossuro-volume loop of a normal heart shown, isovolumetric contraction occurs botwoon which of the following labolod points?\nThe Correct Answer is ! B. W-X\nIn be pressure-volume loop of a normal heart, isovolumeVic convaclion occurs between point W and X. I so volumetric contraction refers a the period of time when the venficles are contracfing. but there is no change in ventricular volume. This occurs because the AV valves are closed and blood cannot enter or\nleave the venViCles. During this phase of the cardiac cycle, pressure within the venVicles rapidly increases. as the ventricles contract and generate force against be closed valves. This increased pressure is represented by the steep rise in pressure from point W a point X on be pressure-volume loop.",

    "Which of the following laboled figures best describes the relationship beLwoon alveolar ventilation and arteriai Pco.?\nc\na\ne\nThe Correct Answer is ! B. B\nLabeled figure B best describes the relationship between alveolar ventilation and arterial Pco2. Alveolar ventilafion refers to the amount of air fat reaches the alveoli in the lung, and arterial Pco2 refers to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the armrial blad. The relafionship between alveolar ventilation and arterial Pco2 is described by the alveolar gas equation. which states that alveolar ventilation and arteria Pco2 are inversely proportional. This means that as alveolar ventilation increases. arterial P\u00a2o2 decreases. and vice versa. The graph in labeled figure B represents his inverse relationship. with an increase in alveolar venfilafion {represented by the upward slope of the line leading to a decrease in arterial Pco2 frepresented by the downward slope of the line).",
