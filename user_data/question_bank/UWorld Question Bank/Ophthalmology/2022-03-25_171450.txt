Educational objective:

The pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity involves an initial downregulation of
proangiogenic factors (eg, VEGF) due to hyperoxia following delivery. Subsequently,
increased metabolic demand causes relative retinal hypoxia, which stimulates a pathological
increase in VEGF leading to aberrant vessel formation. Neonatal oxygen supplementation
increases the risk in premature infants.
