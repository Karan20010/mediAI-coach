This patient with decreased visual acuity and an otherwise normal ophthalmic examination
likely has simple myopia (nearsightedness), a refractive error caused by an increased
anterior-posterior diameter of the eye. The risk is greatest for those with a positive family
history or those of East Asian descent.

During the adolescent growth spurt, the axial length of the globe also grows rapidly, making
the incidence of new-onset myopia highest in this age group. As the anterior-posterior
diameter increases, the focal point of a refracted image lies anterior to the retina. For
images to be seen clearly, they must be projected directly onto the retina; therefore, the image
displacement in myopia causes blurred vision of long-distance objects and decreased visual
acuity on examination. Vision of nearby objects is unaffected and appears clear in myopic
patients. The remainder of the examination, including extraocular movements, peripheral field
testing, and funduscopic examination, is normal.

Management is with prescription glasses with a diverging (concave) lens, which refocuses the
refracted image onto the retina. The degree of myopia usually stabilizes by early adulthood.
