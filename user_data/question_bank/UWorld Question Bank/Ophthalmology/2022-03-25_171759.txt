Educational objective:

Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (eg, sildenafil, tadalafil) can cause a transient bluish
discoloration to vision. Less common ocular effects include sudden monocular vision loss due
to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy; findings include an afferent pupillary defect,
decreased visual acuity, and optic disc edema.
