This patient has incidental anisocoria (asymmetric pupils). Pupil size is governed by the
balance between ocular sympathetic (dilation) and parasympathetic (constriction) efferents to
the iris. These responses are tested by examining the pupils in bright and dim light:

¢ In bright light, the parasympathetic pathway is dominant. With parasympathetic
defects, pupillary constriction occurs in the "good" eye but not the "bad," causing the
difference between pupils to widen (ie, anisocoria increases) in bright light. The larger
pupil is abnormal (Choice C).

¢ In dim light, the sympathetic pathway becomes dominant. With sympathetic defects,
pupillary dilation occurs in the "good" eye but not the "bad," causing anisocoria to
increase in the dark. The smaller pupil is abnormal.

This patient's anisocoria increases in bright light, consistent with a parasympathetic defect
causing her right pupil to not constrict properly in response to light; the unaffected left pupil
constricts normally. In the dark, both pupils dilate because sympathetic input is intact
bilaterally; a small degree of anisocoria will still be present because basal parasympathetic
activity is reduced in the left eye.
