(Choice A) Corticosteroids are often administered to women in preterm labor to induce
surfactant production by the fetal lungs and decrease the risk or severity of neonatal
respiratory distress syndrome. This therapy is not associated with neonatal retinal
neovascularization.

(Choice B) Terbutaline is a beta agonist used to delay preterm labor and delivery by
suppressing uterine contractions. Fetal risks include tachycardia and hypoglycemia (due to
maternal hyperglycemia causing fetal hyperinsulinism), not ROP.

(Choice C) Neonatal ophthalmic antibiotic treatment (ie, erythromycin) prevents gonococcal
conjunctivitis and can cause chemical conjunctivitis in rare cases; however, retinal changes
would not occur.

(Choice E) Exogenous surfactant decreases alveolar surface tension and alveolar collapse
(ie, atelectasis), improving ventilation/perfusion mismatch. This therapy allows for
supplementation of oxygen at decreased concentrations, which helps prevent ROP.

Educational objective:
The pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity involves an initial downregulation of
proangiogenic factors (eg, VEGF) due to hyperoxia following delivery. Subsequently,

increased metabolic demand causes relative retinal hypoxia, which stimulates a pathological
Block Time Elapse
