Educational objective:

Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is a disorder of impaired horizontal gaze caused by a lesion in
the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF). The affected eye (ipsilateral to the lesion) is unable
to adduct while the contralateral eye is able to abduct (often with associated nystagmus).
Convergence and the pupillary light reflex are preserved because these pathways bypass the
MLF.
