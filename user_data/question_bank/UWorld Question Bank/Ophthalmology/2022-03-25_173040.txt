glaucoma, and atherosclerosis, age-related changes themselves do not cause these
conditions. Actinic keratoses (ie, premalignant lesions increasing squamous cell carcinoma
risk) are rough, scaly, erythematous papules on sun-exposed areas that result from ultraviolet
damage. Angle-closure glaucoma occurs due to impaired aqueous humor flow.
Atherosclerosis is primarily attributable to hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and genetic (familial)
predisposition.

(Choice D) Femoral head osteonecrosis is associated with vasculitis (lupus), corticosteroid
therapy, sickle cell disease, and alcohol use disorder. It is not an age-related condition and
can occur in children (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease).

Educational objective:

Presbyopia and skin wrinkles are age-related changes. Presbyopia occurs due to
denaturation of structural proteins within the lens, leading to loss of lens elasticity which can
result in improved vision in patients with mild myopia. Decreased synthesis and increased
breakdown of collagen and elastin contribute to the development of skin wrinkles.
