This patient with chronic, progressive loss of peripheral vision has typical features of open-
angle glaucoma. Glaucoma is a type of optic neuropathy characterized by atrophy of the
optic nerve head. It is more common with advancing age and is especially common in certain
ethnicities (eg, African Americans). Glaucoma is usually associated with elevated intraocular
pressure (IOP) due to increased production or decreased outflow of aqueous humor.
Aqueous humor is produced by the epithelial cells of the ciliary body. It is secreted into the
posterior eye chamber and transferred through the pupil into the anterior eye chamber. The
anterior chamber angle (iridocorneal angle) contains a trabecular meshwork through which the
aqueous humor diffuses into Schlemm's canal (scleral venous sinus) and subsequently into
episcleral and conjunctival veins.

Diagnostic features of glaucoma include elevated IOP and abnormal visual field testing with
decreased peripheral vision. Funduscopic examination will show an increased cup-to-disc
ratio due to loss of ganglion cell axons. The goal of treatment in glaucoma is to decrease IOP
with drugs that either decrease the production of aqueous humor or increase its outflow.
Timolol and other nonselective beta blockers work by diminishing the secretion of aqueous
humor by the ciliary epithelium.
