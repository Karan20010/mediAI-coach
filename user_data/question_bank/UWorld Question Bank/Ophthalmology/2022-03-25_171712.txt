(Choices B, C, D, and E) The intraocular muscles of the eye, including the ciliary muscle and
pupillary sphincter of the iris, receive parasympathetic innervation from cholinergic fibers of the
oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve Ill). Cholinergic agonists (eg, pilocarpine) cause miosis by
promoting contraction of the sphincter of the iris. This causes the anterior chamber angle to
become wider and makes the trabecular meshwork more accessible to outflow of aqueous
humor. Cholinergic agonists also promote ciliary muscle contraction, causing the lens to
become more convex.

Educational objective:

Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by progressive loss of peripheral vision from elevated
intraocular pressure. Timolol and other nonselective beta blockers work by diminishing the
secretion of aqueous humor by the ciliary epithelium. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase
inhibitor, also decreases aqueous humor secretion by the ciliary epithelium. Prostaglandin
F2a (eg, latanoprost, travoprost) and cholinomimetics (eg, pilocarpine, carbachol) decrease
intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous humor.
