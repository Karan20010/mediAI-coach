Educational objective:

Chronic hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes can lead to increased permeability and
arteriolar obstruction in retinal vessels. The resulting ischemia stimulates production of
vascular endothelial growth factor and other angiogenic factors, leading to neovascularization
(proliferative diabetic retinopathy). Complications include retinal hemorrhage, retinal
detachment, and vision loss.
