(Choice A) Disorders of complement regulation can lead to autoimmune disease (eg,
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) or increased susceptibility to infections with
encapsulated bacteria (eg, Neisseria), but these disorders are typically genetic conditions
rather than the result of trauma.

(Choice C) Immune surveillance is a process by which cytotoxic lymphocytes and natural
killer cells can recognize neoplastic cells either by their expression of tumor antigens or by a
lack of expression of self-antigens (eg, MHC class 1).

(Choice D) Immunoglobulin class switching is the process through which activated B

lymphocytes switch production from IgM immunoglobulins during the primary immune
response to IgG and IgA isotypes, which are active during the secondary response. This

occurs in the germinal centers of lymph nodes and requires interaction of the CD40 receptor

on B cells with the CD40 ligand expressed by activated T cells.

(Choice E) Positive selection of T cells occurs prior to negative selection and is responsible
for development of a T cell repertoire that can recognize and bind to self-MHC molecules. T
cells expressing a T-cell receptor that is able to bind self-MHC are allowed to survive (although
if that response is too strong, they will usually be eliminated through negative selection).
