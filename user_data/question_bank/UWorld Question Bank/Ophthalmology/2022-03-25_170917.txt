(Choice A) Direct extension via the anterior chamber can occur in the setting of a corneal
infection following trauma or surgery. It is rare for Candida to otherwise spread via the anterior
chamber.
(Choice B) Rhizopus is a mold that affects primarily those with immunocompromise and

diabetes mellitus. It first attacks the paranasal sinuses and then spreads into adjacent tissue
(eg, orbit, eye). This is not a typical pattern for Candida.

(Choice D) Herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus can reactivate in the optic nerve
root and travel in a retrograde fashion to infect the retina, leading to retinal vasculitis or acute
retinal necrosis. Candida does not spread in this fashion.

(Choice E) Lymphatic spread is common with many atypical bacteria and some endemic
fungi. However, Candida does not usually spread to the eye through the lymphatic system.

Educational objective:

Candida endophthalmitis typically occurs due to hematogenous dissemination to the choroid
layer in the setting of fungemia. Most cases arise in hospitalized patients with indwelling
central catheters. Patients usually have unilateral eye floaters and progressive vision loss.
