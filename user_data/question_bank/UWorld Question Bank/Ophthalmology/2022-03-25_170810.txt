(Choices A and D) An oculomotor nerve lesion would disrupt parasympathetic innervation of
the ipsilateral pupil, resulting in anisocoria that increases under bright light because the
abnormal larger pupil is unable to constrict in response to light.

(Choice B) Damage to the left oculosympathetic pathway would cause loss of sympathetic
input to the left eye, resulting in a fixed, constricted pupil in the left eye (with increased
asymmetry in dim light) rather than in the right.

(Choices C and F) The optic nerves carry the afferent portions of the pupillary reflex from
each eye. A unilateral optic nerve lesion would not cause pupillary asymmetry, but instead
monocular vision loss and decreased bilateral pupillary constriction in response to light
entering the affected eye (ie, relative afferent pupillary defect).

Educational objective:

Pupillary asymmetry (ie, anisocoria) is caused by a lesion in the ocular parasympathetic
(pupillary constriction) or sympathetic (pupillary dilation) pathways. In this patient, the pupillary
asymmetry increases in a dim room, indicating that the smaller right pupil is unable to dilate
due to a lesion in the right oculosympathetic pathway.
