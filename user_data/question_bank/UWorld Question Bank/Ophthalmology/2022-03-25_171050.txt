(Choices A and D) Central retinal artery occlusion is most commonly due to atherosclerosis,
cardioembolic disease, or vasculitis (eg, giant cell arteritis). It causes acute monocular vision
loss. Examination can reveal a cherry red spot at the macula due to diffuse retinal ischemia,

but hemorrhage is not typically seen.

(Choices B and E) Smoking and hyperlipidemia can increase the risk of developing ischemic
retinal and optic vascular disease; however, these are not associated with an increased risk of
retinal hemorrhage.

(Choice C) Closed-angle glaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure from
impaired aqueous humor drainage. It causes acute headache, eye pain, vision loss, and an
afferent pupillary defect. Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals cupping of the optic disc
without hemorrhage.

(Choice G) Ocular migraine and migraine with visual aura can present with transient visual
disturbances, with or without headache. Ophthalmoscopic examination is normal in patients
with migraine.

(Choice H) Thyroid eye disease (eg, Graves disease) can present with diplopia and proptosis;
however, it is not associated with an increased risk of retinal hemorrhage.
