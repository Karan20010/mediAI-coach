(Choice A) Absence of the left corneal reflex (corneal stimulation causes orbicularis oculi to
contract the eyelids) can result from lesions involving the afferent limb (CN V,) or efferent limb

(CN VIl).

(Choice C) A lesion involving the left CN VII would result in the inability to close the left eye
due to paralysis of the orbicularis oculi muscle.

(Choice D) Inward deviation of the left eye would result from paralysis of the lateral rectus,
which is innervated by the abducens nerve (CN VI).

(Choice E) The left optic nerve (CN Il) is functional in this patient because light shining into
the left eye produced a consensual pupillary response in the right eye.

Educational objective:

The oculomotor nerve (CN III) provides innervation to many of the extraocular muscles
(superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, inferior oblique), parasympathetic innervation to
the pupil, and somatic innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris. Dysfunction of CN III
leads to a characteristic triad of a "down and out" pupil, an efferent pupillary defect, and ptosis.
