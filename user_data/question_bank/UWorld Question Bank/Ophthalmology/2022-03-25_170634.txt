Up to 5% of women develop a primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (typically a
mononucleosis-like illness with fever and mild hepatitis) during pregnancy. Vertical
transmission to the fetus occurs in approximately one-third of cases, with the highest risk of
transmission occurring in the first trimester. CMV-related complications observed in infants
exposed to the virus in utero include chorioretinitis (most common eye-related problem),
sensorineural deafness, seizures, jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and microcephaly.
