Retinitis pigmentosa

Etiology

Genetic dystrophy
Progressive retinal degeneration (photoreceptors, pigmented
epithelium)

Clinical features

Loss of rods:

© Night blindness

© Peripheral visual field loss

Loss of cones:

© Decreased central visual acuity (late finding)

Funduscopic
changes

Retinal vessel attenuation (likely due to altered metabolic
demand)

¢ Optic disc pallor (optic nerve atrophy and gliosis)

Pigment accumulation (characteristic bone-spicule pattern
around vessels)
