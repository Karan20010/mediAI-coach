This patient has bilateral opacities in the ocular lenses, findings consistent with cataracts.
Cataracts can cause difficulty with reading and fine visual tasks; patients often see
excessive glare at night and halos around bright lights due to light scattering in the lens.
Examination findings include white or gray cloudiness of the lens, decreased visualization of
retinal detail, and loss of the red reflex.

Cataracts are generally related to chronic photooxidative injury; the prevalence increases
with age, and most patients with cataracts first develop symptoms at age >60. However,
cataracts can develop earlier in individuals, such as this patient, with exposure to systemic or
ophthalmic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone). This may be due to glucocorticoid-induced
transcription of genes in the lens epithelial cell that may alter lens homeostasis or increase the
susceptibility to oxidative injury. Other causes of premature cataract formation include
diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, and external radiation exposure.
