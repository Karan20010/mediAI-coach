This patient has anisocoria (ie, pupillary asymmetry), which indicates a unilateral defect in
input from either the ocular sympathetic (pupil dilation) or parasympathetic (pupil constriction)
pathway. In response to dim light, input from the oculosympathetic pathway initiates
pupillary dilation, allowing more light to reach the retina. Under bright light, parasympathetic
input from the ipsilateral oculomotor nerve (CN Ill) initiates pupillary constriction, limiting the
amount of light received by the retina.

Determining which pathway is affected in anisocoria can be accomplished by observing the
change in pupillary discrepancy in both bright and dim light:
e¢ Asymmetry that increases in dim light indicates that the smaller pupil is unable to dilate
due to loss of sympathetic nerve input. Under bright light, the asymmetry will decrease
because parasympathetic input (pupillary constriction) is unaffected.

¢ Asymmetry that increases under bright light indicates that the larger pupil is unable to
constrict due to loss of parasympathetic nerve input. In dim light, the asymmetry will
decrease because sympathetic input (pupillary dilation) is unaffected.

This patient has increased asymmetry in a dim room, indicating that the smaller (right) pupil
is unable to dilate due to loss of sympathetic nerve input secondary to a lesion in the right
oculosympathetic pathway.
