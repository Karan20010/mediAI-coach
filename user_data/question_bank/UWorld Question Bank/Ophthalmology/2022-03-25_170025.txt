Aqueous humor is secreted by epithelial cells of the ciliary body into the posterior eye
chamber. The fluid then flows through the pupil into the anterior chamber to the iridocorneal
angle. Here, it diffuses through a trabecular network into Schlemm's canal (scleral venous
sinus) and subsequently drains into episcleral and conjunctival veins. A small amount of
aqueous can also diffuse through the ciliary muscle and adjacent sclera (uveoscleral pathway).

Open-angle glaucoma is characterized by increased intraocular pressure due to increased
secretion or decreased outflow of aqueous humor. It is a form of optic neuropathy and causes
progressive loss of ganglion cell axons, which may be visualized as a pale optic disc and
enlarged optic cup (compared to normal retina). Symptoms evolve over decades, with
progressive loss of peripheral visual fields.

Glaucoma is managed with agents that either decrease production or increase outflow of
aqueous humor. Latanoprost is a topical prostaglandin used in the treatment of glaucoma. It
is applied as a prodrug and converted to the active form by esterases in the cornea.
Prostaglandins are the preferred first-line agents for the treatment of glaucoma, and although
the exact mechanism of action is uncertain, they have been found to decrease the collagen
content in the uveoscleral outflow pathway and increase outflow of aqueous humor. They
are also known to cause increased pigmentation in the iris and eyelashes.
