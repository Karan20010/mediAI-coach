ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads is diagnostic of an inferior myocardial infarction
(MI). Inferior Mls are often due to blockage of the right coronary artery, the artery usually
responsible for sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) node perfusion. Thus, inferior Mls are
often associated with bradycardia. Atropine blocks vagal influence on the SA and AV nodes
and is effective in increasing heart rate in such patients. Atropine's side effects are due to
muscarinic receptor blockade in other organs. In the eye, atropine causes mydriasis, resulting
in narrowing of the anterior chamber angle and diminished outflow of aqueous humor. This
can precipitate angle-closure glaucoma in patients with shallow anterior chambers or higher
than normal intraocular pressures. Acute closed-angle glaucoma presents with unilateral
severe eye pain and visual disturbances (eg, halos). Individuals of Inuit and Asian descent are
at increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma.

The clinical indications for anticholinergic medications are summarized in the table.
