Although prematurity alone can lead to ROP, the risk is increased in premature neonates with
significantly elevated arterial oxygen tension because hyperoxia exacerbates the initial
VEGF suppression and increases risk of subsequent aberrant neovascularization. In this
case, the patient had neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental
oxygen, which likely contributed to disrupted retinal angiogenesis.
