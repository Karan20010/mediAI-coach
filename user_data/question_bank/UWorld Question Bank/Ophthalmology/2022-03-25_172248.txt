This patient has diplopia (suggesting a lesion impacting extraocular muscles) and a left
efferent pupillary defect (absent left pupillary response when light enters either eye). This is
likely due to dysfunction of the left oculomotor nerve (CN Ill), which has multiple functions:

¢ Innervation of most of the extraocular muscles (superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior
rectus, inferior oblique). Paralysis of these muscles leads to unopposed action of the
superior oblique and lateral rectus, which results in the characteristic "down and out"
pupil.

¢ Parasympathetic fibers innervate the iris sphincter and ciliary muscle. Paralysis of
these fibers causes an efferent pupillary defect, as seen in this patient.

¢ Somatic innervation of the levator palpebrae superioris. This elevates the upper eyelid,
and paralysis of it leads to ptosis (ie, drooping of the eyelid).

Although the most common causes of acquired oculomotor nerve palsy are diabetes mellitus
and hypertensive ischemia, patients are often evaluated with neuroimaging to rule out an
enlarging aneurysm of the posterior-communicating artery, which can present with isolated CN
Ill palsy.
