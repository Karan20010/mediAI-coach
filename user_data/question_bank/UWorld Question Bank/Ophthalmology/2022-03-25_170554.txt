(Choice A) Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV)
infections. Although these infections occasionally cause acute retinal necrosis, most cases
arise in older, immunocompetent individuals (not patients with advanced AIDS). In addition,
HSV retinitis and VZV retinitis are usually associated with significant vitreal inflammation,
spotty peripheral retinal lesions, and infrequent hemorrhage.

(Choice B) Candida endophthalmitis is treated with amphotericin B. Funduscopy usually
reveals focal, white, mound-like lesions on the retina. Most cases occur in the setting of an
indwelling central venous catheter or total parenteral nutrition.

(Choice C) Clarithromycin is used in conjunction with other antibiotics for the treatment of
Mycobacterium avium complex infection, which usually causes fever, night sweats, abdominal
pain, and diarrhea.

(Choice D) Cryptococcus neoformans infections are treated with flucytosine, a fluorinated
analog of cytosine, in combination with amphotericin B. Although cryptococcal endophthalmitis
can occur in patients with advanced AIDS, it is much less common than CMV retinitis, and
patients often have other manifestations of cryptococcal infection such as skin lesions or
meningoencephalitis.
