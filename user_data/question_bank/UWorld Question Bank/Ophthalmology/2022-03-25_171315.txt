(Choice A) The abducens nerves innervate the lateral rectus muscles, which abduct the
eyes. Alesion involving an abducens nerve would result in impaired abduction of the

ipsilateral eye due to lateral rectus muscle palsy.

(Choice B) The lateral geniculate nucleus is located in the thalamus and relays visual
information to the ipsilateral primary visual cortex. Damage to this structure would result in a
contralateral homonymous hemianopia.

(Choice D) Unilateral infarction of the primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe (eg, posterior
cerebral artery occlusion) typically results in contralateral homonymous hemianopia with
macular sparing as the macula receives collateral circulation from the middle cerebral artery.

(Choice E) Oculomotor nerve palsy (eg, ipsilateral mydriasis, ptosis, "down and out" deviation
of the eye) may occur with microvascular nerve ischemia (eg, diabetes mellitus) or nerve
compression (eg, posterior communicating artery aneurysm).

(Choice F) The superior colliculus controls vertical gaze. Damage to the superior colliculus in
the dorsal midbrain causes Parinaud syndrome (eg, upward gaze palsy, absent pupillary light
reflex, impaired convergence).
