(Choices A and B) The visual pathway carries afferent signals from the retina to the visual
. - cortex. Lesions preceding the optic chiasm (eg, retina, optic nerve [CN II]) cause monocular
7 vision loss; however, pupils remain symmetric (no anisocoria) with ambient lighting because
: the efferent sympathetic or parasympathetic tracts are not involved. Instead, prechiasmatic

to visual pathway lesions cause a relative afferent pupillary defect: When light is shone in the
affected eye, no signal is transmitted, so pupillary constriction is equally impaired bilaterally.

(Choices E and F) With sympathetic defects (eg, damage to cervical sympathetic chain or
45 ganglia), the affected pupil cannot properly dilate, so anisocoria increases in dim light. In
response to bright light, both pupils constrict because parasympathetic innervation is intact
18 bilaterally, and the anisocoria is reduced.

: 20 Educational objective:

Anisocoria (asymmetric pupils) is caused by a lesion in the ocular parasympathetic

23 (constriction) or sympathetic (dilation) pathways. In this patient, anisocoria increases in bright
: light, indicating that the larger right pupil is unable to constrict due to a defect in the right

+ 26 parasympathetic pathway.
