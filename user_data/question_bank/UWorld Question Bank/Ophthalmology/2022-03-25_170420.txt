This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with idiopathic intracranial hypertension
(pseudotumor cerebri). This condition typically presents in young obese women with daily
headache, bilaterally symmetric papilledema, and transient visual disturbances related to
impaired cerebral venous outflow and elevated intracranial pressure. Symptoms
characteristically worsen during the Valsalva maneuver (eg, bending down, coughing) because
intracranial pressure increases.

Increased intracranial pressure is transmitted through the cerebrospinal fluid in the
subarachnoid space, which is continuous with the optic nerve sheath. This buildup of pressure
compresses the optic nerves externally, which in turn impairs axoplasmic flow within the
optic nerves, causing bilateral optic disc edema (papilledema). Funduscopy shows elevation
of the optic disc with blurred disc margins.
