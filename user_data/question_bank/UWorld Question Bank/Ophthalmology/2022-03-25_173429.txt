Progressive extracellular matrix accumulation can eventually result in retinal hypoxia, which
stimulates local vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and causes subretinal
neovascularization with formation of leaky vessels. This condition is termed wet AMD and
presents with acute vision loss (days to weeks) with metamorphopsia (distortion of straight
lines). Funduscopy shows a grayish-green subretinal discoloration with adjacent
fluid/hemorrhage.

Patients with dry or wet AMD may benefit from antioxidant vitamins and zinc, and smokers

should receive smoking cessation counseling to prevent disease progression. Wet AMD
usually requires specific treatment with VEGF inhibitors (eg, ranibizumab, bevacizumab).
