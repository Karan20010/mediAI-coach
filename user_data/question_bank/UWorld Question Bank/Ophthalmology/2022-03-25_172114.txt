diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, and external radiation exposure.

(Choices A and D) The increased risk of premature cataract formation in patients with
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is due primarily to chronic/frequent glucocorticoid
exposure, not to the disease itself. Patients with SLE are often treated with
hydroxychloroquine; long-term use can cause retinopathy, which presents with decreased
central visual acuity, photopsia (flashing lights), and central macular degeneration.

(Choice B) Excessive, not limited, lifetime sun exposure is associated with an increased risk

of cataracts.

(Choice E) Common manifestations of vitamin D deficiency include hypocalcemia, bone pain,
and accelerated bone loss. Cataracts are not a major consequence of vitamin D deficiency.

Educational objective:

Cataracts are related primarily to chronic photooxidative injury. Most patients with cataracts
first develop symptoms at age >60 but exposure to systemic or ophthalmic glucocorticoids can
cause cataracts at an early age. Other causes of premature cataract formation include
diabetes mellitus, ocular trauma, and external radiation exposure.
