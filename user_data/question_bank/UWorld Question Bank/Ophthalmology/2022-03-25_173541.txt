(Choice A) Homonymous hemianopsia is a loss of vision in the same side of the visual field in
both eyes. It occurs due to transection of the contralateral optic tract, the fibers of the visual
pathway linking the optic chiasm to the lateral geniculate body.

(Choice B) Binasal hemianopsia is a loss of vision in the nasal fields of both eyes. Itis
caused by pressure to the lateral areas of the optic chiasm. This may result from calcified
carotid arteries.

(Choice C) Bitemporal hemianopsia is a loss of vision in the temporal fields of both eyes. Itis
caused by compression of the medial part of the optic chiasm, where the nasal fibers
decussate, most commonly by a pituitary adenoma.

(Choice D) Arcuate scotomas occur due to damage to a particular region of the optic nerve
head. The resulting visual field defect follows the arcuate shape of the nerve fiber pattern.

Educational Objective:

A scotoma is a visual field defect that occurs due to a pathologic process that involves parts of
the retina or the optic nerve resulting in a discrete area of altered vision surrounded by zones
of normal vision. Lesions of the macula cause central scotomas.
