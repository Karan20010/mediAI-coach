The macula is a yellowish spot approximately 1.5 mm in diameter located near the center of
the retina. It is characterized histologically by the presence of densely packed cones, few
overlying cells and no blood vessels. Each macular cone synapses to a single bipolar cell,
which, in turn, synapses to a single ganglion cell. Due to this arrangement the visual acuity in
the macula, and particularly the fovea, is greater than in any other area of the retina. The
neural fibers that serve the macula transmit to an area of the occipital visual cortex that is
separate from the area of representation of the peripheral fields (this area is also relatively
large in size). Due to this peculiar cortical representation, macular sparing is common in
lesions of the occipital cortex.
