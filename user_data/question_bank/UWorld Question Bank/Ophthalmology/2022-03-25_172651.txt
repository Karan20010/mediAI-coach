This patient has poor night vision, visual field loss, and funduscopic changes (eg, pigment
accumulation, optic disc pallor, retinal vessel attenuation) consistent with retinitis
pigmentosa, a genetic disease characterized by progressive dystrophy of the retinal
pigmented epithelium and photoreceptors (eg, rods, cones).

Rods, which are highly metabolically active and most prevalent in the periphery, are affected
first, leading to the initial manifestations of progressive night blindness and loss of
peripheral vision. Early funduscopic changes include retinal vessel attenuation (ie, narrow
vessels likely due to alterations in retinal metabolic demand) and a waxy, pale optic disc (due
to optic nerve atrophy and gliosis).

In advanced disease, loss of cones (most prevalent in the central retina) causes decreased
central visual acuity. Degeneration of retinal pigmented epithelial cells releases pigment,
which deposits in a characteristic bone-spicule pattern over the course of the disease.
