(Choice A) Retinoblastoma, which is caused by inactivation of both alleles of the RB7 gene
(ie, 2-hit hypothesis), typically presents in the first 3 years of life with leukocoria (ie, white
pupillary reflex), strabismus, and a creamy-white mass on funduscopic examination.

(Choice C) Increased intracranial pressure can be associated with transient visual
obscuration and decreased visual acuity. However, other symptoms (eg, headache,
vomiting) are also typically present and papilledema with blurred optic disc margins would be
seen on funduscopy.

(Choice D) Angle-closure glaucoma occurs due to narrowing of the angle between the iris and
the cornea, which blocks aqueous outflow. Patients typically have acute eye pain and vision
loss with conjunctival erythema, cornea edema, and a mid-dilated, poorly reactive pupil. Optic
nerve atrophy secondary to chronically increased intraocular pressure results in optic nerve
cupping on funduscopy.

(Choice E) Central retinal artery occlusion typically presents with unilateral painless acute
vision loss in patients age >40 with thromboembolic risk factors (eg, hypertension). Retinal
whitening and a cherry-red macula are the characteristic funduscopic changes.
