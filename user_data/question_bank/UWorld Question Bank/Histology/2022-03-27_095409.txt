induces some fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts that produce intracellular
contractile proteins (eg, actin, myosin). Myofibroblast contraction helps decrease the size of

the wound.

(Choice C) Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells that reside within the stratum basale.
They are derived from neural crest cells and are distinct from basal cells (ie, keratinocyte stem
cells). Failure of melanocytes to migrate into a healing scar can lead to permanent scar

hypopigmentation.

(Choice D) Several immune cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells, are
responsible for pathogen phagocytosis during the inflammatory phase of wound healing.
Macrophages are of particular importance for clearing foreign bodies and cellular debris (eg,
apoptotic neutrophils).

Educational objective:

Keratinocytes are responsible for wound reepithelization. They migrate into the wound from its
edges and are repopulated by replication within the stratum basale. Keratinocytes continue to
migrate and proliferate until they contact other similar cells, a regulatory mechanism known as

contact inhibition.
