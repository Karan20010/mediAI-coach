This patient is suffering from recurrent bouts of herpes labialis ("cold sores"), which is most
commonly caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Primary infection occurs following
contact with an affected individual's saliva. Although it is often asymptomatic, infection can
result in painful blister formation on the oral mucosa and surrounding skin of the mouth and
lips. After resolution of the initial infection, the virus enters a latent phase where viral particles
lay dormant in neural sensory ganglia (most commonly the trigeminal).

Reactivation of the virus occurs during times of stress or illness, resulting in recurrence of the
characteristic perioral vesicular lesions. During reactivation, HSV particles rely on
anterograde axonal transport to reach the skin and oral mucosa. Anterograde axonal
transport is mediated by kinesin, a motor protein that moves intracellular cargo (eg,
organelles, viral particles) away from the nucleus, down the axon, and toward the nerve
terminal. Kinesin-mediated movement is powered by ATP hydrolysis and guided by
microtubule filaments, which function as an intracellular "track" system.

(Choice A) Dynein is a microtubular motor protein that participates in retrograde axonal
transport (ie, moving organelles toward the nucleus). Dynein is important in establishing the
latent phase following primary HSV infection by transporting viral particles to the neural
sensory ganglia. However, it is not responsible for disease recurrence.
