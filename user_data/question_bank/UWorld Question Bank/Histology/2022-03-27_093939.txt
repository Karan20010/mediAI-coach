which are calcium-dependent adhesion proteins that bind epithelial cells together. The
cytoplasmic anchor of adherens junctions is the actin filament, whereas the cytoplasmic
anchor of desmosomes is the intermediate filament. Autoantibodies against desmoglein, a
cadherin protein for desmosomes, are found in pemphigus vulgaris.
(Choice C) Fenestrae are transcellular pores within endothelial cells that facilitate increased

solute exchange. They are found in capillaries perfusing the intestine, renal tubules, and

endocrine glands.

(Choice E) Hemidesmosomes are similar to desmosomes but link cells to the basement
membrane via integrins, transmembrane anchor proteins. Autoantibodies to
hemidesmosomes cause bullous pemphigoid and pemphigoid gestationis.

(Choice F) Tight junctions (zonula occludens), composed of claudins and occludin, prevent
paracellular passage of fluid and solutes. Tight junctions between capillary endothelial cells
help form the blood-brain barrier.

Educational objective:

Gap junctions facilitate communication and coordination between cells and play an important
role in labor contractions. Gap junctions are composed of connexin proteins, which are
upregulated in the uterus in response to rising estrogen levels.
