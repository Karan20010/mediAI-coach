The combination of lower-extremity paresthesias, macrocytic red blood cells (RBCs), and
gastric body and fundal atrophy is highly suggestive of pernicious anemia (PA). PAis an
autoimmune disorder caused by the cell-mediated destruction of parietal cells, oxyntic (pale
pink) cells found predominantly in the upper glandular layer of the gastric body and fundus.
Over time, progressive parietal cell destruction leads to chronic atrophic gastritis (ie,
autoimmune gastritis), characterized histologically by a CD4-predominate inflammatory
infiltrate, oxyntic gland atrophy, and intestinal metaplasia (ie, replacement of normal epithelia
with goblet cells).

Parietal cells are responsible for the secretion of hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor, a
glycoprotein that is involved in the absorption of B,. (cobalamin, an essential nutrient). After a
critical number of parietal cells are destroyed and hepatic stores of cobalamin are depleted,
patients develop B,, deficiency. This results in a megaloblastic anemia, characterized by
macro-ovalocytes (elevated mean corpuscular volume, oval-shaped RBCs) and
hypersegmented neutrophils. Patients also develop neurologic dysfunction due to
demyelination of the dorsal and lateral spinal tracts, resulting in paresthesias and ataxia.
(Choice A) This region contains simple columnar epithelial cells that secrete mucus to protect

the gastric lining from acid.
