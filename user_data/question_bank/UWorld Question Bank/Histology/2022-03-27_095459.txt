Question Id: 8

This pediatric patient with nephritic syndrome (eg, periorbital edema, hematuria, hypertension)
following a recent skin infection most likely has poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis
(PSGN). PSGN is the most common cause of nephritic syndrome in children and typically
occurs 2-4 weeks after exposure to group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (eg, pharyngitis,
skin infection). Antigens expressed on nephritogenic streptococcal species combine with
antibodies to form immune complexes, which are deposited on the glomerular basement
membrane (GBM) and induce complement activation and inflammation.

These immune complexes are visible on immunofluorescence microscopy as granular
deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 on the GBM and mesangium, producing a "starry sky"
appearance. Electron microscopy can show the immune deposits as discrete, electron-dense,
subepithelial humps on the GBM. The classic light microscopy finding in PSGN is enlarged,
diffusely hypercellular glomeruli due to leukocyte infiltration (neutrophils and monocytes) and
mesangial and endothelial cell proliferation.

Laboratory studies show decreased serum complement (eg, C3) due to consumption, and
elevated titers of streptococcal antibodies (eg, anti-DNAse B, antihyaluronidase,
antistreptolysin O [ASO, which is typically elevated with pharyngitis but often undetectable
after skin infections]).
