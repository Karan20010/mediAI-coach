This patient's Parkinson symptoms do not improve with intravenous dopamine infusion
because dopamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. The blood-brain barrier is
formed by tight junctions between nonfenestrated capillary endothelial cells that prevent the
paracellular passage of fluid and solutes. Tight junctions, also known as zonulae
occludentes, are composed of transmembrane proteins (eg, claudins and occludins) that
associate with actin filaments, forming a beltlike seal around the apical intercellular space.
This seal only permits the passage of substances from the blood to the brain via transcellular

movement.

Transcellular movement of dopamine is limited by the molecule's low lipid solubility and the
lack of dopamine-specific transport carriers in capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain
barrier. L-DOPA (dopamine precursor) also has low lipid solubility, but it is able to enter the
brain due to its high affinity for the large neutral amino acid transporter.

(Choice A) Desmosomes (maculae adherentes) are spotlike junctions that anchor adjacent

cells together via keratin intermediate filament interactions. Autoantibodies against
desmosomes in the stratum spinosum of the skin cause pemphigus vulgaris.

(Choice B) Fenestrae are small pores within endothelial cells that allow free fluid exchange

between the intravascular and extravascular spaces. They are found in capillaries perfusing
