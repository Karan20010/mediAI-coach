: The initiation of labor requires a series of biochemical changes in the uterus and cervix
- mediated by endocrine changes (eg, increased estrogen & progesterone). Communicating
7 gap junctions are especially important during labor and delivery, which require coordination
: and synchronization of individual myometrial (uterine smooth muscle) cells.
Gap junctions facilitate electrical and chemical communication between neighboring cells via a
2 connexon, a connecting cylinder with a central channel composed of connexin proteins (eg,
8 connexin 43). In preparation for labor, increasing estrogen levels stimulate upregulation of
- connexin 43, increasing formation of gap junctions between individual myometrial cells. An
: increase in gap junction density allows the passage of small ions between neighboring
18 myometrial cells, resulting in coordinated, synchronous labor contractions.
= Estrogen also increases the expression of uterotonic oxytocin receptors, Gy—coupled
at membrane receptors that increase intracellular calcium levels, heightening myometrial
, excitability.
* (Choices A and B) Both adherens junctions and desmosomes are composed of cadherins,
26 which are calcium-dependent adhesion proteins that bind epithelial cells together. The

cytoplasmic anchor of adherens junctions is the actin filament, whereas the cytoplasmic

anchor of desmosomes is the intermediate filament. Autoantibodies against desmoglein, a
