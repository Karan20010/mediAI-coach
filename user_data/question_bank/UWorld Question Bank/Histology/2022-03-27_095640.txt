(Choice A) Renal amyloidosis causes a nephrotic syndrome (ie, heavy proteinuria,
hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, edema); significant hematuria is unexpected.
Immunofluorescence microscopy is nonspecific and may show diffuse mesangial staining
(rather than distinct, linear immune deposits on the GBM). On Congo red staining, amyloid
deposits appear red-pink under light microscopy and have an apple-green birefringence under
polarized light.

(Choice C) In membranous nephropathy, which causes a nephrotic syndrome,
immunofluorescence demonstrates granular deposits of IgG and C3 along the GBM. Uniform,
diffuse capillary wall thickening is seen on light microscopy.

(Choice D) Nodular glomerulosclerosis (Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion) and mesangial expansion
are seen on light microscopy in diabetic nephropathy, which presents as a nephrotic
syndrome. There are no immune deposits on immunofluorescence.

(Choice E) Normal glomeruli are found on light microscopy in minimal change disease, a
condition that primarily affects children and presents as a nephrotic syndrome. There are no
immune deposits on immunofluorescence.
