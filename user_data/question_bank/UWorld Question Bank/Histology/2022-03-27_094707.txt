(Choice C) Genetic factors are not known to strongly predispose to chronic bronchitis.
Genetic mutation causing alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can lead to panacinar emphysema;
however, chronic bronchitis is not a significant component of the disease.

(Choice D) Repeated bronchial/bronchiolar bacterial and viral infections can contribute to the
development of chronic bronchitis, although less significantly than can smoking. Tobacco
smoke predisposes to infection by impairing ciliary clearance and directly damaging the
respiratory epithelium.

(Choices E and F) Nickel is a carcinogen, and occupational exposure is associated with
nasal and lung cancers. However, neoplastic transformation itself does not contribute to the
development of chronic bronchitis. Although this patient's history of nickel mining is also
suggestive of silica dust exposure, smoking is the most important risk factor for chronic

bronchitis.

Educational objective:

Thickened bronchial walls, lymphocytic infiltration, mucous gland enlargement, and patchy

squamous metaplasia of the bronchial mucosa are features of chronic bronchitis. Tobacco

smoking is the leading cause of chronic bronchitis. ctivate V
