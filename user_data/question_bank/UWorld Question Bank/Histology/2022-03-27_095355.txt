This patient sustained a large flank abrasion that healed by secondary intention (ie, from the
base upward). This process, which occurred over 3 weeks, involved the formation of well-
vascularized connective tissue (ie, granulation tissue) at the wound base and resurfacing of
the wound with new epithelium (ie, reepithelialization).

Reepithelialization is triggered when injury to the skin disrupts most or all of the layers of the
epidermis, resulting in loss of keratinocyte-to-keratinocyte contact. Contact with other
keratinocytes typically limits cell division and/or motility (ie, contact inhibition). However, when
this contact is lost due to injury, keratinocytes are stimulated to replicate and migrate until a
continuous epithelial layer is restored.

From the wound edges, keratinocytes migrate across newly formed granulation tissue at
the wound base and are replenished via replication of basal keratinocytes in the stratum
basale. This process continues until keratinocytes meet other keratinocytes (ie, contact
inhibition), corresponding with completion of reepithelization (eg, wound covered in pearly
pink epithelium). At this point, proliferation and migration signals cease, and the stratification

process begins.
