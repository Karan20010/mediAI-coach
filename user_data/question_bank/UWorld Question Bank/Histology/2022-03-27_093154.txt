report that she has 3-5 loose, nonbloody bowel movements daily with occasional episodes of
vomiting. She was breastfed exclusively until age 9 months and has since had a well-varied
diet including whole milk, fruits, vegetables, bread, and meats. However, the girl has been
less interested in food over the past several weeks. There is no history of travel or contacts
