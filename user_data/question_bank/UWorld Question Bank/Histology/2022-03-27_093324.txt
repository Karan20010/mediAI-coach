epidermis of the nipple-areolar complex. Paget cells are malignant, intraepithelial
adenocarcinoma cells that appear enlarged with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli
on microscopy. These cells and associated skin changes are thought to be caused by the
spread of an underlying breast malignancy (eg, intraductal carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in
situ) to the nipple surface via the mammary ducts, resulting in the eczematous nipple rash.

Because approximately 85% of patients have an underlying breast malignancy, all patients

with PDB require diagnostic mammography even without a palpable breast mass.

(Choice B) Cutaneous angiosarcoma, which can arise in the radiation field following
radiotherapy for breast cancer, typically presents as purple papulonodular lesions and bruise-
like patches. Microscopy often shows anastomosing vascular channels infiltrating the dermis
lined by atypical (ie, large, hyperchromatic) endothelial cells.

(Choice C) Fibroadenomas are small, firm, mobile breast masses that occur due to the
