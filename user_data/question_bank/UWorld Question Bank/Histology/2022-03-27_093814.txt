Nipple discharge can be physiologic (ie, bilateral, nonbloody or milky, without masses or skin
changes) or pathologic (ie, bloody or serosanguineous and unilateral with or without palpable
masses and skin changes).

The most common cause of pathologic nipple discharge is an intraductal papilloma, which
classically presents as a unilateral, bloody nipple discharge with no associated breast masses,
skin changes, or axillary lymphadenopathy. Although most cases of intraductal papilloma are
benign, all patients with pathologic nipple discharge require evaluation with imaging (eg,
mammogram or ultrasound, depending upon age) and possibly with biopsy. On microscopy,
intraductal papilloma shows epithelial and myoepithelial cells lining fibrovascular cores
forming papillae within a duct or cyst wall. The bloody discharge results from twisting of the
vascular stalk of the papilloma in the duct.

(Choice A) Paget disease of the breast occurs due to the ductal spread of atypical malignant
cells to the nipple epidermis. Although patients may have bloody nipple discharge, they also
have a unilateral erythematous, intensely pruritic, ulcerative lesion over the nipple and areola,
which is not seen in this patient.

(Choice B) Fibrocystic changes of the breast may show cysts with or without metaplasia and
areas of fibrosis. Patients with fibrocystic changes typically have cyclic breast pain, not nipple
