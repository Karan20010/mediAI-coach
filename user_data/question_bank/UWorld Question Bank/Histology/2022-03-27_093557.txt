(Choice A) Extravasated erythrocytes, siderophages, and perivascular lymphocytes are
characteristic of venous stasis dermatitis, which typically occurs at the lower extremities and
presents with brown discoloration (hemosiderin deposition).
(Choice B) Hyperkeratosis and sawtoothed rete ridges are characteristic of lichen planus,

which presents as small pruritic, purplish, polygonal papules or plaques. It frequently occurs at
the volar wrist but is typically multifocal; a large, localized plaque is atypical.

(Choice D) In pemphigus vulgaris, autoantibodies against desmosomes lead to loss of
intercellular adhesion (ie, acantholysis) and intraepithelial cleavages that manifest as flaccid
bullae. Unlike ACD, pemphigus vulgaris may show a sparse inflammatory infiltrate; loss of
intercellular adhesion is caused by autoantibodies, not edema.

(Choice E) Neutrophilic microabscesses and epidermal hyperplasia (ie, acanthosis) are
characteristic of psoriasis, which presents as erythematous plaques with thick scales typically
on the extensor, not flexor, surfaces of the extremities. Although epidermal hyperplasia is seen
in chronic ACD, neutrophilic microabscesses are not expected.

Educational objective:
Allergic contact dermatitis (eg, nickel allergy) is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction
characterized by epidermal intercellular edema (ie, spongiosis) and an inflammatory infiltrate
