This patient has hypertension, hematuria (with mild pyuria), and moderate proteinuria,
suggesting a diagnosis of nephritic syndrome. Immunofluorescence microscopy further
demonstrates linear deposits of immunoglobulin (typically IgG) and complement along the
glomerular basement membrane (GBM), a finding characteristic of anti-GBM disease
(Goodpasture disease). Anti-GBM antibodies target collagen type IV, a component of the
GBM, leading to subsequent complement deposition. This results in a form of rapidly
progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis (RPGN).

RPGN is a syndrome of severe renal injury that results in abrupt-onset renal injury and
decreased glomerular filtration (causing weight gain and edema, as seen in this patient). It
can occur due to multiple diseases (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic
polyangiitis). The presence of glomerular crescents—composed of proliferating parietal cells,
lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibrin—on light microscopy is diagnostic.

Anti-GBM antibodies may cross-react with collagen type IV in the pulmonary alveolar
basement membrane and cause pulmonary hemorrhage, which presents as hemoptysis. The
combination of renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage in patients with anti-GBM antibodies is
known as Goodpasture syndrome.
