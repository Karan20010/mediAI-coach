¢ From 10 to 14 days post-MI, prominent fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and
neovascularization of granulation tissue are present.

¢ From 2 weeks to 2 months post-MI, collagen remodeling and fibroblast differentiation into
myofibroblasts drive the formation of scar tissue (Choice D).

e After 2 months post-MI, remodeling continues to a slower rate as the scar matures and
contracts (Choice E).

Educational objective:

Irreversible myocardial ischemic injury initiates a series of predictable morphologic changes
over the hours to weeks after the initial injury. From 1 and 3 days after the initial injury,
neutrophils infiltrate the border zone of the injured tissue (where myocytes are relatively
normal) in response to proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6, IL-8), eventually migrating to the
central portion of the infarct.
