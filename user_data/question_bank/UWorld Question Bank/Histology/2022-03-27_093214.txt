Celiac disease is a chronic malabsorptive disorder caused by a hypersensitivity to gluten, a
protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Gliadin (a gluten component) triggers an immune-
mediated reaction causing villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and intraepithelial lymphocyte
infiltration. Normal intestinal villi allow for increased small intestinal surface area to begin the
process of digestion and nutrient absorption. The atrophy in celiac disease causes impairment
of nutrient absorption in the duodenum and proximal jejunum, regions where the concentration

of gluten is the highest.

Classic celiac disease presents after introduction of gluten into the diet (between age 6-24
months) with symptoms of malabsorption (eg, diarrhea, steatorrhea, flatulence, nutrient
deficiencies, weight loss). Other manifestations include delayed puberty and short stature in
children and anemia in adults. Screening is with serology testing for elevated IgA anti-
endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies; diagnosis is confirmed by
endoscopic biopsy. With strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, symptom resolution occurs
within weeks and is followed by normalization of histology and antibody levels.

(Choice A) Mild gastroesophageal reflux is physiologic in healthy infants, but it can lead to
irritability, poor feeding, and inadequate weight gain when severe. The diagnosis is often
made clinically and can be treated with conservative changes (eg, smaller feedings) and acid
