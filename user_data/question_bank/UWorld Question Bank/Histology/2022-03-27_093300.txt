associated with a rare but highly malignant form of skin cancer known as Merkel cell
carcinoma.
(Choice D) Melanocytes are pigment producing cells of the epidermis that arise from the
neural crest cells and migrate to the basal layer of the epidermis during embryogenesis. They

possess dendritic processes that intercalate between the remaining cells of the epidermis and
facilitate the delivery of pigment-laden melanosomes from the melanocyte to the keratinocytes.

(Choices E and F) Macrophages can be found in the skin, possess myeloid cell surface
markers, and when stimulated, are able to produce dendrite-like extensions of their
cytoplasm. Macrophages can also differentiate into multinucleated (Langhans) giant cells and
epithelioid cells in the setting of granulomatous inflammation. However, monocytes and their
derivatives do not produce Birbeck granules.

Educational Objective:

Langerhans cells are dendritic cells found in the skin that act as professional antigen
presenting cells. These cells are derived from the myeloid cell line and they possess
characteristic racquet-shaped intracytoplasmic granules known as Birbeck granules.
