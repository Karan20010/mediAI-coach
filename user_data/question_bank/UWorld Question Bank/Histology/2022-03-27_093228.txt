made clinically and can be treated with conservative changes (eg, smaller feedings) and acid
suppression (eg, proton pump inhibitor). Refractory cases may require biopsy, which shows
esophageal inflammation.

(Choice B) Anti-inflammatory medications (eg, glucocorticoids, aminosalicylates) are the
mainstay of treatment for inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn
disease [CD]). Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and weight loss.
Colonoscopy may show diffuse colonic inflammation in UC and focal areas of small intestinal
and colonic inflammation in CD.

(Choice C) Tropical sprue can occur with extended travel to the tropics and presents with
chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and flatulence along with similar histologic findings to celiac
disease (eg, villous atrophy). The etiology is likely infectious, and the disease is treated with
antibiotics. However, this patient has no history of travel.

(Choices D and E) Lactase supplementation or limited lactose intake is recommended for
patients with lactose intolerance, which classically presents in older children and adults with
bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Although biopsy is not indicated for
diagnosis, histology would show normal small intestinal architecture with decreased lactase

activity.
