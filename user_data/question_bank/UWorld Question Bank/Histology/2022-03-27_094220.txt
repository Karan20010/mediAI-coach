Educational objective:

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune complexâ€”mediated disease that occurs 2-4
weeks after group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infection. Immune complexes composed of
IgG, IgM, and C3 are deposited along the glomerular basement membrane and are visible on
electron microscopy as large, dome-shaped, subepithelial, electron-dense deposits.
