portion of the infarct. These neutrophils phagocytize dead myocytes and release
lysosomal enzymes, reactive oxygen species, and cytokines (eg, IL-1, TNF-a) that can

prevent infiltration by pathogens and facilitate wound healing.

From 3 to 10 days post-MI, macrophages infiltrate and phagocytize dead myocytes and
neutrophils while initiating the formation of granulation tissue by producing cytokines (eg,
IL-10) and growth factors (TGF-B) (Choice C).

From 10 to 14 days post-MI, prominent fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and
neovascularization of granulation tissue are present.

From 2 weeks to 2 months post-MI, collagen remodeling and fibroblast differentiation into
myofibroblasts drive the formation of scar tissue (Choice D).
e After 2 months post-MI, remodeling continues to a slower rate as the scar matures and
contracts (Choice E).
Educational objective:
Irreversible myocardial ischemic injury initiates a series of predictable morphologic changes
over the hours to weeks after the initial injury. From 1 and 3 days after the initial injury,
