dinucleotidase.

This pediatric patient with hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria, and edema has a nephritic
syndrome. The onset 3 weeks after a bacterial skin infection suggests poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis (PSGN), an immune complex—mediated disease that occurs 2-4 weeks
after exposure to group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (eg, impetigo, pharyngeal infection).
Acute kidney injury is common and leads to fluid and salt retention, often resulting in edema

and hypertension.

The immune complexes in PSGN are deposited along the glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) and are visible on electron microscopy as large, dome-shaped, subepithelial,
electron-dense deposits ("humps"). These can be further visualized on immunofluorescence
as granular deposits of IgG, IgM, and C3 along the GBM and glomerular mesangium
("lumpy-bumpy" appearance). On light microscopy, the glomeruli are enlarged and
hypercellular due to leukocyte infiltration.

(Choice A) Proteins such as albumin may be lost in the urine due to increased permeability of
the glomerular capillary wall in PSGN. However, albumin does not deposit within the

glomerulus or renal tubules.
