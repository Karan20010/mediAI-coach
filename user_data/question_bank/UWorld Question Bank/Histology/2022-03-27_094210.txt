(Choice B) Many antibiotics (eg, penicillins, cephalosporins) can cause acute interstitial
nephritis (AIN), which manifests as peritubular T-lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophilic
infiltration. However edema, significant hematuria, and proteinuria are uncommon, and AIN
usually resolves when the offending agent is discontinued.

(Choice C) Prominent fibrin deposition is characteristic of rapidly progressive (crescentic)
glomerulonephritis.

(Choice D) Hyaline, acellular deposits composed of plasma proteins, can be seen in
Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules of diabetic nephropathy.

(Choice F) Lipid droplets in renal tubules may be seen in conditions causing nephrotic
syndrome, which leads to heavy proteinuria and edema; however, hypertension and hematuria
are unexpected. In addition, lipid droplets do not deposit on the basement membrane.

(Choice G) Neutrophils and monocytes infiltrate the glomerular mesangium in PSGN,
contributing to the hypercellular appearance on light microscopy. Enzymes released from
these cells would not typically form extracellular aggregates.
