Educational objective:

The /ac operon is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: negatively by binding of the repressor
protein to the operator locus and positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter
region. Constitutive expression of the structural genes of the /ac operon occurs with mutations
that impair the binding of the repressor protein (Lac |) to its regulatory sequence in the

operator region.
