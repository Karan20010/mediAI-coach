This patient's rheumatoid arthritis is being treated with adalimumab, a tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-alpha inhibitor. TNF-alpha is a crucial cytokine of the cell-mediated immune response
that aids in macrophage activation, phagolysosome function, and the formation and
maintenance of granulomas. Blockade of TNF-alpha increases the risk of infection with
pathogens controlled by the cell-mediated immune response such as intracellular bacteria (eg,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis), viruses, and granulomatous fungi.

This patient's pulmonary and reticuloendothelial (eg, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly)
findings and positive urine fungal antigen test raise strong suspicion for infection with
Histoplasma capsulatum, a dimorphic fungus endemic to the Ohio and Mississippi River
Valleys. H capsulatum is a mold that is inhaled from contaminated soil and converts to a yeast
form in the lungs. Phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages does not result in destruction of the
organism due to microbial virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome acidification.
Therefore, for the first several weeks of infection, H capsulatum is able to proliferate within
macrophages in an unchecked fashion.
