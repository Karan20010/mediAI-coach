This patient with fever, irritability, and poor feeding has bacterial meningitis, a life-threatening
infection most commonly caused by group B Streptococcus or Escherichia coli in neonates.

In this case, the growth of gram-negative rods makes E coli the most likely pathogen;
organisms that ferment lactose (including E coli) cause a local drop in pH on MacConkey agar,
a medium selective for gram-negative organisms, resulting in colonies with a pink-red

appearance.

The pathogenesis of E coli meningitis involves bacterial invasion of the nasopharynx or
gastrointestinal tract, followed by hematogenous spread to the meninges. Different strains of
E coli have specific virulence factors that help enable the bacterium to cause disease, and in
the case of E coli meningitis, the major virulence factor is the K1 capsular antigen.

The capsular antigen facilitates the survival of E coli primarily via molecular mimicry: K1 is a
polysaccharide composed of sialic acid, which is similar to the glycosylated molecules found

on the surface of human cells. K1 prevents recognition of bacterial antigens by the immune
system, inhibiting phagocytosis and complement activation, which promotes bacterial survival

in the bloodstream and tissues.

(Choice B) Shiga toxin is an exotoxin synthesized by enterohemorrhagic E coli, which
presents with bloody diarrhea. Meningitic strains of E coli do not produce Shiga toxin.
