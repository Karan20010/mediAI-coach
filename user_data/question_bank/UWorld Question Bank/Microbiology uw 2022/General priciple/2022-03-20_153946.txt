Influenza viruses (orthomyxoviruses) are respiratory pathogens that can affect several
species, including humans, birds, and swine. They possess the surface proteins
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), which are virulence factors required for
infectivity. These proteins are also targets of the immune system, and neutralizing antibodies
against them can confer immunity to specific influenza strains. As such, HA and NA are under
constant selective pressure both to maintain species-specific virulence and evade immune
recognition.

Orthomyxoviruses contain a segmented genome, and HA and NA are coded by separate RNA
segments. This allows for genetic reassortment when 2 distinct strains infect the same cell.
For instance, avian coinfection with a human influenza A virus (which can also infect birds, the
reservoir species for all influenza A subtypes) and an animal influenza A virus can lead to the
human-type HA and the animal-type NA being packaged together into the same virion. This
has the potential to create a novel strain of virus to which humans are susceptible but have
no immunologic resistance. This phenomenon is known as antigenic shift, and is
responsible for the majority of pandemics and epidemics of influenza A.
