Facial pain, headache, and nasal eschar in a patient with likely diabetic ketoacidosis (pH 7.1,
positive ketones, and dry mucous membranes in a young patient with recent unintended
weight loss) are highly suggestive of mucormycosis, caused by Mucor or Rhizopus, among
others. Most cases are rhinocerebral; the infection (acquired by spore inhalation) ascends
from the nasal passage to the sinuses/orbits and then sometimes to the brain, leading to
confusion, neurological deficits, and death. The increased incidence of mucormycosis in
patients with diabetes mellitus is due to the ketone reductase activity of Rhizopus, allowing it
to thrive in ketoacidotic environments.

Histologic examination (eg, mucosal biopsy) is necessary for diagnosis. The fungi appear as
ribbon-like broad nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching. Tissue invasion is seen
along blood vessels; vascular thrombosis and tissue necrosis can occur. A black necrotic
eschar in the nasal cavity is characteristic. Management includes amphotericin B and surgical
debridement.

Mucormycosis (common in diabetes) must be differentiated from invasive aspergillosis causing
rhinosinusitis (common in neutropenic patients). On light microscopy, Aspergillus is seen as
septated narrow hyphae with sharp-angle branching.
