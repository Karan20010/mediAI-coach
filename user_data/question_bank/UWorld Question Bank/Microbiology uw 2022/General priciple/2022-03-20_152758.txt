Educational objective:

Erythema infectiosum (fifth disease) is caused by parvovirus B19 and presents with a
nonspecific prodrome (eg, malaise, fever, congestion) followed by a classic "slapped-cheek"
facial rash and a lacy, reticular body rash. Parvovirus is highly tropic for erythroid precursor

cells and replicates predominantly in the bone marrow.
