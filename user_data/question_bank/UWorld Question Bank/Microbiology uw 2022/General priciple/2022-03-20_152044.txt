Travelers to malaria-endemic regions should be counseled on mosquito avoidance measures
and given chemoprophylaxis. Mosquito avoidance strategies include staying indoors at
dawn/dusk (when mosquitos are most active), wearing insect repellant, limiting exposed skin,
and sleeping within insecticide-treated nets. Chemoprophylaxis targets the predominant
species of the region and takes into account the presence of drug resistance. In Africa, where
chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum is endemic, common chemoprophylaxis
regimens include atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine.

Mefloquine is a schizonticide that actively destroys replicating parasites within red blood
cells. However, it is inactivated in the liver and has no efficacy against hepatic schizonts.
Therefore, patients must receive mefloquine chemoprophylaxis for 4 weeks upon return to
ensure that parasites released from the liver are destroyed when they infect red blood cells
(liver schizonts rupture over 8-30 days). Individuals who do not take mefloquine upon return
(as in this case) are at risk for hepatic schizont release and subsequent red cell infection,
leading to symptomatic malaria.
