A 4-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother due to decreased appetite, abdominal
cramps, and diarrhea over the last 3 days. The stools were initially watery but have now
become bloody. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F). Mucous membranes are dry, and the
abdomen is mildly distended and diffusely tender to palpation. Stool studies are positive for
fecal leukocytes and occult blood. Stool cultures grow non-lactose fermenting, gram-negative

rods on MacConkey agar. The bacteria ferment glucose without gas production, do not
generate hydrogen sulfide when grown on triple sugar iron agar, and cannot replicate at
refrigeration temperatures. Which of the following bacterial factors is most essential for the
pathogenesis of this patient's disease?

©) A. Exotoxin production

©) B. Intestinal colonization

©) C. Mucosal invasion
