(Choice B) Proteins (and spores) are sterilized by moist heat (eg, autoclave), which results in
protein denaturation. Although proteins are somewhat susceptible to alcohol-based
disinfectants, high concentrations must be used and efficacy is variable. Alcohol has the
strongest effect on lipophilic membranes.

(Choice C) RNAcan be rendered inert by ionizing radiation, which dislodges electrons and
results in the formation of reactive ions that break covalent bonds. Alcohol has a minimal
effect on RNA molecule integrity.

(Choice D) Neuraminidase, 1 of the 2 influenza surface glycoproteins, can be blocked by
neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir, zanamivir). These are often used to treat acute
influenza (prevent the virus from leaving infected cells).

(Choice E) The M2 ion channel mediates fusion of the influenza envelope with the endosome
membrane, which liberates the influenza nucleocapsid and enzymes into the cytoplasm of the
host cells. Blockade of the M2 ion channel with amantadine can prevent influenza infection.
However, because influenza virus has developed widespread resistance to M2 ion channel
inhibitors, these drugs are not recommended for use in the United States.
