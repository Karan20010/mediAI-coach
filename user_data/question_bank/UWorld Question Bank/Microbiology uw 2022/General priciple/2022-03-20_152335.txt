Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is marked by the presence of HBsAg, HBeAg, and
anti-HBc, and a lack of anti-HBs. Infections are often asymptomatic, but many patients have a
few months of jaundice, fatigue, nausea, and right upper—quadrant discomfort. Perinatal
transmission is most common in high-prevalence countries (eg, Sub-Saharan Africa); in low-
prevalence regions (eg, United States), most cases occur due to unprotected sex or

intravenous drug use.
HBV is a hepadnavirus composed of:
¢ an outer lipid envelope that contains viral-encoded proteins (HBsAg) and host lipid
components.

¢ an icosahedral nucleocapsid core that contains a circular, partially double-stranded DNA
genome and a DNA polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity.

HBV binds to a bile salt transporter on the surface of hepatocytes and enters the cell. After the
virus is uncoated in the host cytoplasm, the single-stranded DNA portion of the viral genome is
completed (repaired) by cellular DNA polymerases. This generates double-stranded viral
DNA, which is subsequently transcribed by host RNA polymerase into a +single-stranded
RNA pregenome. The +RNA template is then translated into the proteins that compose the

virus (eg, envelope, core, polymerase); it is also converted by viral DNA polymerase/reverse
