(Choice A) Malaria undergoes asexual reproduction in humans. However, a minority of
circulating merozoites differentiate into male and female gametocytes that can be passed to
feeding Anopheles mosquitos to continue their replicative cycle (malaria undergoes sexual
reproduction in the midgut of the mosquito). Gametocytes do not undergo sexual reproduction

in humans and do not cause symptoms.

(Choice B) Cases of P falciparum in Africa are usually resistant to chloroquine. Therefore,
alternate agents (eg, mefloquine) are given for chemoprophylaxis. Cross-resistance between
classes of medications does not typically occur.

(Choice C) Malaria has been eradicated from the United States; therefore, individuals who
develop malaria in the United States were infected while in other countries. This patient
continued prophylaxis during the duration of her travels but ceased prophylaxis upon her
return, which allowed developing hepatic schizonts to infect red blood cells and cause malaria.

(Choice E) P ovale and P vivax have a dormant hepatic phase (hypnozoite) that may
reactivate several months after return from an endemic region (if not treated with primaquine).
In contrast, P falciparum does not have a dormant hepatic phase; it matures in (and is
released from) the liver over 8-30 days.
