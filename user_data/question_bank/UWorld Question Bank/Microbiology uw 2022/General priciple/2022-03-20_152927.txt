(Choice A) The K1 capsular antigen promotes bloodstream survival of E coli because its sialic
acid composition is similar to human cells (ie, molecular mimicry), which helps prevent
phagocytosis and facilitates invasive infections. It is the major virulence factor for E coli strains
causing neonatal meningitis (not UTIs).

(Choice B) Enterotoxigenic E coli produces heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins
in the gastrointestinal tract. ST activates guanylate cyclase, causing an increase in cyclic
GMP. LT activates adenylate cyclase, increasing cyclic AMP levels. These enterotoxins lead
to watery diarrhea, not UTI symptoms.

(Choices C and D) Lipid Aand O antigen are components of lipopolysaccharides, which
make up the majority of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. Lipid Ais a virulence
factor that activates macrophages, leading to widespread release of inflammatory cytokines
(eg, IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which in turn causes endothelial injury, increased
vascular permeability, and septic shock. The O antigen is on the outer surface and is a
variable polysaccharide used to classify gram-negative bacteria. Neither component is a
major virulence factor for uropathogenic E coli.
