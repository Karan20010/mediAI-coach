The Staphylococci are Gram-positive cocci that form clusters, pairs and, rarely, short chains.
The catalase test (with 3% hydrogen peroxide) differentiates Streptococci (catalase-negative)
from Staphylococci (catalase-positive). The ability to clot blood plasma (slide and tube
coagulase tests) separates Staphylococci into two groups: the coagulase-positive
Staphylococci, which constitutes the most pathogenic species Staphylococcus aureus, and
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), which constitutes S. epidermidis, S. Saprophyticus,
S. haemolyticus, and 30+ other species. The coagulase-negative staphylococci exist as part
of the normal flora on the skin and in the throat and nose, and only some species can cause
infections.

S. saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infection; it is responsible for almost half
of all UTIs in sexually active young women. S. saprophyticus is resistant to novobiocin. When
catalase-positive, coagulase-negative gram-positive cocci in clusters are isolated from urine
specimens of the above group of patients, the laboratory performs a novobiocin test to
distinguish this organism from other similar pathogens.
