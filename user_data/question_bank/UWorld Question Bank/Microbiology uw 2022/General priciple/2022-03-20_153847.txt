Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has 6 or more genotypes and multiple subtypes that differ in genomic
composition by as much as 30%-35%. This is largely due to the fact that the virion-encoded
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase has no proofreading 3' â€” 5' exonuclease activity, which
results in many errors during replication.

Although most patients are infected with a single genotype, the high mutation rate leads to the
development of distinct quasispecies within infected individuals over time. These variant
strains differ primarily at hypervariable genomic regions, such as those found in the
sequences coding for its envelope glycoproteins. The continuous generation of novel
envelope glycoproteins prevents infected individuals from mounting an effective immune
response. As production of host antibodies against a quasispecies commences, that strain
dies off and new ones take its place. The tremendous antigenic variety of HCV has
significantly slowed efforts to develop an effective vaccine.
