The acquisition of a new viral surface protein is often all that is necessary for a virus to infect a
new type of host cell. In this scenario, avian and human influenza virus particles infect host
pig cells; certain progeny avian virus particles obtain some of the surface components (eg,
sialic acid receptors) of the human influenza virus, allowing the avian virus to infect human
cells. This exchange is an example of phenotypic mixing, which generally occurs when a
host cell is coinfected with 2 viral strains and progeny virions contain unchanged parental
genome from one strain and nucleocapsid (or envelope) proteins from the other strain.
However, because there is no change in the underlying viral genomes (no genetic exchange),
subsequent progeny will revert to having only avian influenza type surface proteins and will
again be noninfectious to human epithelium.
