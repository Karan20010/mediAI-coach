This patient has bloody diarrhea due to Escherichia coli, with enzyme immunoassay
detecting a substance capable of inhibiting protein synthesis in human cells. These findings
are characteristic of Shiga toxin produced by Shiga toxin—producing E coli, or
enterohemorrhagic E coli.

E coli and Shigella species are closely related genetically, and Shiga toxin is also produced by
Shigella dysenteriae. Shiga toxin is an AB cytotoxin with an active (A) subunit and 5 binding
(B) subunits:

¢ The B subunits, which form pentamers with a central pore, recognize specific receptors on
target cells and induce receptor-mediated endocytosis and toxin internalization.

¢ The enzymatically active A subunit is then released and catalyzes the removal of a specific
adenine residue in the 60S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing transfer RNA from
binding to the ribosome complex and inhibiting protein synthesis.

This leads to intestinal mucosal cell death (bloody diarrhea) and, with hematogenous spread,
toxicity to renal epithelial cells (hemolytic uremic syndrome).
