Erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, is a benign childhood illness caused by parvovirus
B19, a single-stranded DNA virus. After a 1-2 week incubation period, a nonspecific
prodrome (eg, malaise, congestion, headache, fever) is followed by an erythematous rash on
the cheeks. This "slapped-cheek" rash, as shown in the image above, usually spares the
nasolabial folds and develops after the initial symptoms have resolved. A lacy, reticular rash
then follows, spreading over the trunk and extremities. The rash may result from immune
complex deposition, the timing of which coincides with increasing levels of serum virus-specific
IgM and IgG.

Parvovirus B19 replicates in erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. These cells
express blood group P antigen (also known as globoside), which is the cellular receptor for
parvovirus B19. Viral replication in the nucleus leads to cell lysis (ie, decreased reticulocytes
and red blood cells). Acute and chronic sequelae of parvovirus B19 infection can occur in
specific populations (eg, chronic anemia in immunosuppressed patients, aplastic crisis in those
with underlying hematologic abnormalities such as sickle cell disease).
