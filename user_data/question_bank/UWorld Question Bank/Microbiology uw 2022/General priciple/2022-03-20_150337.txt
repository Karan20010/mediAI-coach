The initial attachment of the virion envelope or capsid surface proteins to the complementary
host cell surface receptors is essential to viral tropism for specific tissues and invasion of
cells. Many viruses bind to normal host cell plasma membrane receptors to enter host cells.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus responsible for acute infectious mononucleosis,
nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and certain lymphomas (eg, Burkitt lymphoma). More than 90%
of the normal adult population is seropositive for EBV, which is primarily transmitted through
contact with oropharyngeal secretions. The EBV envelope glycoprotein gp350 binds to CD21
(also known as CR2), the cellular receptor for the C3d complement component. CD21 is
normally present on the surface of B cells (CD19-positive cells) and nasopharyngeal epithelial
cells. Therefore, exposure to a monoclonal anti-CD21 antibody could interfere with EBV
attachment to B cells.

(Choice A) Adenovirus has hexon and penton capsomeres on its surface. Rodlike structures
("fibers") that project from the penton base capsomeres are responsible for mediating
adsorption to host cells. The cell receptor for most adenovirus fibers is a transmembrane

protein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily.

(Choice B) Like other herpesviruses, cytomegalovirus requires initial contact with

glycosaminoglycan chains on host cell surface proteoglycans for entry into the host cell. It
