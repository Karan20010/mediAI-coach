(Choice C) Hemolysin is secreted by staphylococci and causes hemolysis as well as the
destruction of neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets. It is a secreted factor that is not bound
to the cell wall.

(Choice D) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae produce IgA proteases
that cause cleavage of IgA antibodies, preventing them from interfering with bacterial adhesion
to mucous membranes.

(Choice E) Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (found on an antigen presenting
cells) normally interacts with processed antigens, presenting them to T-lymphocytes to initiate
an immune response. In contrast, superantigens (enterotoxins, toxic shock syndrome toxin)
interact with MHC class II and the T-cell receptor outside of standard antigen binding sites to
initiate widespread and nonspecific activation of T- lymphocytes. Although superantigens are
synthesized by staphylococci, they are not bound to the peptidoglycan cell wall.
