Autoclave machines are pressure cookers that use heated steam at temperatures of 134 C
(273.2 F) to rapidly destroy pathogenic bacteria, fungi, viruses, and spores. Lower
temperatures are often associated with inadequate sterilization due to the presence of spore-
forming bacteria, which can survive at temperatures past the boiling point of water (100 C
[212 F]). Bacterial spores are often found in soil and water and are resistant to chemical
disinfectants, irradiation, desiccation, and temperatures as high as 120 C (248 F). Bacillus
(eg, Bacillus anthracis) and Clostridium (eg, Clostridium perfringens, C botulinum) species
are among the most common spore-forming pathogenic bacteria.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) These organisms do not form spores; vegetative bacteria are
usually destroyed by temperatures >70 C (158 F).

Educational objective:
Spore-forming bacteria can survive boiling temperatures. Bacillus and Clostridium species are
common pathogenic spore-forming bacteria.
