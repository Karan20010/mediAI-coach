This patient's fever, abdominal cramps, and bloody diarrhea (dysentery) are consistent with
bacterial enteritis. Stool culture results are most specific for Shigella species, which are nonâ€”
lactose fermenting organisms with no hydrogen sulfide production on triple sugar iron
agar (unlike Salmonella). In addition, Shigella ferments glucose, in contrast to Campylobacter,
a curved rod that does not.

Shigella is transmitted via the fecal-oral route (eg, person-to-person, contaminated
food/water). Once in the gastrointestinal tract, the bacteria is able to invade the intestinal
epithelium via the microfold (M) cells that overlie Peyer patches. After cell entry, Shigella lyses
its containment vacuole, multiplies within the cytoplasm, and exits the basolateral surface of
the cell where it can more easily enter enterocytes and then spread to adjacent cells via
host-cell actin polymerization.

Shigella also induces macrophage apoptosis, triggering a robust host inflammatory response.
The disrupted epithelial barrier leads to ulcerations and leakage of blood, inflammatory cells,
and mucus into the intestinal lumen, resulting in bloody, mucoid stools.
