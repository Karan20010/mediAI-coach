Microbiologists are investigating sugar metabolism in wild-type and mutant strains of
Escherichia coli. Both strains are found to grow viable colonies on lactose-containing media.
Each strain is then cultured on a new growth medium containing only glucose. Representative
colonies of each strain from the new media undergo Western blot processing using a
fluorescently labeled probe specific for B-galactosidase. Wild-type bacterial colonies are found

to contain only trace quantities of B-galactosidase. However, the mutant colonies express
significant amounts of B-galactosidase. Further analysis reveals that the variant strain
contains a mutation that inhibits the binding of a certain protein to its regulatory sequence. In
which of the following locations did this mutation most likely occur?

©) A. Activator protein (CAP) binding site
©) B. Operator locus

©) C. Promoter region

() D. Activator protein (CAP) gene

() E. RNA polymerase cistron
