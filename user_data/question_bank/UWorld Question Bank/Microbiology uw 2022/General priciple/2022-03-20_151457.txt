(Choice A) Differential media help identify cultured organisms based on their metabolic and
biochemical properties. Examples of differential media include the MacConkey and eosin
methylene blue (EMB) agars used to culture enteric organisms. Organisms that ferment
lactose will appear pink on MacConkey agar and black on EMB agar.

(Choice B) Enrichment media contain special growth factors required for some organisms.
Examples include the X and V factors required by Haemophilus or the anaerobic conditions
needed by Clostridium species.

(Choice C) Reducing media (eg, thioglycolate broth) remove oxygen and are used to culture
anaerobic organisms.

(Choice E) Asynthetic medium is any chemically-defined medium for which all of the
chemical contents are known.

Educational objective:

Neisseria can be isolated by culture on selective media such as the Thayer-Martin VCN
(vancomycin/colistin/nystatin) medium, which inhibits growth of contaminants such as gram-
positive organisms, gram-negative organisms other than Neisseria, and fungi.
