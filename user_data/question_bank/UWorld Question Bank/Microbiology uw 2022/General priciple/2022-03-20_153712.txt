Educational objective:

Tumor necrosis factorâ€”alpha inhibitors are associated with impairments to the cell-mediated
immune response and increase the risk of infection with intracellular bacteria and
granulomatous fungi (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum). Histoplasma replicates within the
intracellular space of macrophages and can spread from the lungs to the lymph nodes and the
reticuloendothelial system (liver, spleen, bone marrow).
