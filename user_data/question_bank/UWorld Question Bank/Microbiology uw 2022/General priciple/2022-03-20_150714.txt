distinct mechanisms:

1. Negatively by binding of the repressor protein to the operator locus
2. Positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter region

Mutations impairing the binding of the repressor protein to its binding site at the operator
region will prevent repression of the genes of the /ac operon in the absence of lactose. This
results in increased transcription of the genes of the /ac operon in lactose-deficient media,
although the presence of glucose will prevent maximal transcriptional activity.

(Choices A and D) Mutations that impair the binding of cCAMP-CAP to its regulatory site
upstream from the promoter will decrease transcription of the Jac operon, as CAMP-CAP is a
positive regulator.

(Choices C and E) Mutations impairing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promotor
region will also reduce transcription of the /Jac operon.

Educational objective:

The /ac operon is regulated by two distinct mechanisms: negatively by binding of the repressor
protein to the operator locus and positively by cAMP-CAP binding upstream from the promoter
region. Constitutive expression of the structural genes of the /ac operon occurs with mutations
