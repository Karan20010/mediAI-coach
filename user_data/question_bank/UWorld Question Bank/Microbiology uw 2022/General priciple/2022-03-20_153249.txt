(Choice A) Circulating heparins prolong the partial thromboplastin time by activating
antithrombin Ill, thereby decreasing thrombin activity and ultimately preventing fibrinogen
conversion to fibrin, thereby preventing clot formation. Circulating heparins would not provide
a binding site for bacteria.

(Choice B) Endothelial surface glycoproteins mediate binding of immune cells to endothelium,
facilitated by the expression of cell adhesion molecules on the surface of inflamed
endothelium. Neutrophils are then able to bind and migrate between the endothelial cells,
followed by monocytes and lymphocytes.

(Choices D and E) Subendothelial collagen and glycosaminoglycans form the subendothelial
fibrous cap over the central core of an atherosclerotic plaque and are potent platelet
activators. When exposed (eg, denuded endothelium in atherosclerotic plaque), they
contribute to rapid thrombus formation that can lead to myocardial infarction in a coronary
artery.
