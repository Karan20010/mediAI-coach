Educational objective:

Shiga toxinâ€”producing Escherichia coli 0157:H7 elaborates Shiga toxin, which inactivates 60S
ribosomal subunits in colonic mucosal cells, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis and
apoptosis; clinical manifestations include bloody diarrhea. Hematogenous spread of Shiga
toxin to renal endothelial cells can also lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome.
