Educational objective:

Genetic variations created during hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication result in marked variety in
the antigenic structure of HCV envelope proteins. The production of host antibodies lags
behind that of new mutant HCV strains, preventing infected individuals from mounting an

effective immune response.
