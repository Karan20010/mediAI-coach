Educational objective:

Streptococcus pneumoniae is able to undergo transformation, which allows the bacterium to
take up exogenous DNA fragments and express the encoded proteins. Through this method,
strains of S pneumoniae that do not form a capsule can acquire the genes that code for the
capsule and therefore gain virulence.
