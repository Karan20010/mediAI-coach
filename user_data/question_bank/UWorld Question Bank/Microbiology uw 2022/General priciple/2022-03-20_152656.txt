(Choice A) Shiga toxin is an exotoxin that damages intestinal mucosa by inactivating the 60S
ribosomal subunit, halting cellular protein synthesis and causing hemorrhagic colitis. However,
not all pathogenic Shigella species produce Shiga toxin; Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri
(prevalent in resource-rich regions) do not produce Shiga toxin but still cause shigellosis,
making mucosal invasion (common to all Shigella species) the primary pathogenic
mechanism.

(Choice B) Asymptomatic colonization with Shigella does not occur because the bacterium is
highly pathogenic. Ingestion of as few as 10 organisms can lead to mucosal invasion and
active infection.

(Choice D) Sa/monella and Yersinia enterocolitica, which also invade M cells, can gain
access to the lymphatics and proliferate in the mesenteric lymph nodes. In contrast, once
Shigella invades the M cells overlying lymphoid follicles (Peyer patches), it spreads primarily to
adjacent enterocytes; it does not proliferate in lymphoid tissue.

(Choice E) Shigella rarely causes bacteremia because it is readily phagocytosed and
destroyed by neutrophils after entering the bloodstream. Enteric bacteremia is more likely due
to E coli or Salmonella typhi (typhoid fever).
