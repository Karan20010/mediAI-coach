Educational objective:

Traveler's diarrhea is most frequently due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, which produces
plasmid-encoded, heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins. LT resembles cholera
toxin and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic AMP; ST
activates guanylate cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cyclic GMP. Both can contribute
to watery diarrhea due to loss of water and electrolytes.
