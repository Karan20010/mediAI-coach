(Choice A) Endotoxin is a lipopolysaccharide found in the cell membrane of gram-negative
bacteria. When released into the bloodstream, endotoxin causes a severe inflammatory
response (eg, fever, hypotension) mediated by TNF-alpha and IL-1 secreted from activated
macrophages. However, endotoxin is present at high concentrations in the normal gut
microbiota and does not cause gastrointestinal illness.

(Choice C) Enteroaggregative E coli is a less common cause of self-limited watery diarrhea in
resource-limited regions; adhesion of the organisms to intestinal mucosa in a "stacked-brick"
pattern is characteristic. Biofilm formation can occur but is thought to primarily play a role in
cases of persistent (not acute) disease.

(Choice D) Intestinal invasion is characteristic of gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella,

Shigella, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. Due to
mucosal cell necrosis, invasion frequently leads to bloody diarrhea (not seen here).

(Choice E) Shiga toxin-producing E coli (STEC) and Shigella dysenteriae produce Shiga toxin
that inactivates the 60S ribosomal subunit in human cells, thereby inhibiting cell protein

production. Bloody diarrhea due to mucosal cell death is typical.
