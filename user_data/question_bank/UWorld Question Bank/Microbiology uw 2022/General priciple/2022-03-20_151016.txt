Clusters of gram-positive cocci on Gram stain is a characteristic finding of staphylococcal
species such as Staphylococcus aureus. Protein A is a virulence factor that forms part of the
outer peptidoglycan layer of S aureus. Protein A binds with the Fc portion of IgG antibodies at
the complement-binding site, preventing complement activation (Choice A). This results in
decreased production of C3b, leading to impaired opsonization and phagocytosis.
