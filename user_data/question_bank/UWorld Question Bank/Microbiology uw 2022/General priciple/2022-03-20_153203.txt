(Choices A and D) Neutrophils and the complement system are important defense
mechanisms against bacterial infections. They have no significant role in controlling parasitic

combating intracellular intestinal pathogens such as Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma
gondii.

(Choice C) Eosinophils do not play an important role in immune defense against Giardia;
eosinophilia is not seen in giardiasis and white cells are usually absent from the stool.
Eosinophils are more important for combating intestinal helminthic infections.
