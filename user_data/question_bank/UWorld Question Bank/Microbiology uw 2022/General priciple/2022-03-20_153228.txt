This patient with mitral valve prolapse (as suggested by the auscultated systolic click and
murmur) now has bacteremia following dental cleaning. Viridans streptococci are normal
inhabitants of the oral cavity and cause transient bacteremia after dental procedures. These
gram-positive organisms are capable of producing extracellular polysaccharides (dextrans)
using sucrose as a substrate.

Dextrans facilitate streptococcal adherence to fibrin. Fibrin and platelets are deposited at
sites of endothelial trauma, providing a site for bacterial adherence and colonization during
bacteremia. In patients with pre-existing valvular lesions, viridans streptococci can adhere to
the affected valve and establish infection leading to endocarditis. Other factors that facilitate
pathogenesis may also be involved. Staphylococcus aureus is more aggressive and can
adhere to intact valves. The risk of endocarditis following dental procedures is low with mitral
valve prolapse, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended; however, cases can still occur.
