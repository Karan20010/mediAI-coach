septated narrow hyphae with sharp-angle branching.

(Choice A) Blood cultures are usually negative in mucormycosis despite the organism's
angioinvasive nature. In contrast, blood cultures can be useful in diagnosing candidemia,
which has a variable clinical presentation ranging from low-grade fever to severe sepsis with
multiorgan failure.

(Choice B) Lumbar puncture helps to diagnose cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal infection that
typically has an indolent presentation and usually affects patients with AIDS. India ink staining
of cerebrospinal fluid reveals the classic encapsulated yeast of Cryptococcus neoformans.

(Choice D) Ophthalmoscopy is useful for the diagnosis of Candida endophthalmitis, which
typically presents with impaired visual acuity.

(Choices E and F) Serologic testing is important in the diagnosis of allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), where increased titers of IgE and antibodies to
Aspergillus fumigatus are seen. Skin hypersensitivity testing is also useful. However, the
typical presentation of ABPA is recurrent episodes of fever and bronchial obstruction in a
patient with asthma.
