Microbiologists are investigating sugar metabolism in wild-type and mutant strains of
Escherichia coli. Both strains are found to grow viable colonies on lactose-containing media.
Each strain is then cultured on a new growth medium containing only glucose. Representative
colonies of each strain from the new media undergo Western blot processing using a

fluorescently labeled probe specific for B-galactosidase. Wild-type bacterial colonies are found
to contain only trace quantities of B-galactosidase. However, the mutant colonies express
significant amounts of B-galactosidase. Further analysis reveals that the variant strain
contains a mutation that inhibits the binding of a certain protein to its regulatory sequence. In
which of the following locations did this mutation most likely occur?

A. Activator protein (CAP) binding site (19%)
YB. Operator locus (43%)

C. Promoter region (27%)

D. Activator protein (CAP) gene (8%)

E. RNA polymerase cistron (1%)
