Influenza virus is a segmented, negative-sense RNA virus that is enveloped within a host-
derived plasma membrane. Interaction with the host cell is dependent upon a viral surface
glycoprotein called hemagglutinin, which binds to the sialic acid receptor on human
respiratory epithelial cells. Influenza strains that are unable to infect humans (eg, avian/swine
influenza) encode for hemagglutinin that cannot bind to human cells.

However, influenza is prone to antigenic changes in its surface glycoproteins due to:

¢ Poor proofreading of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which results in the
introduction of genetic mutations during replication (antigenic drift).

e Reassortment of the segmented genome when 2 influenza viruses infect the same cell,
which results in dramatic alterations to the genome (antigenic shift).

Antigenic changes to hemagglutinin can alter the tissue tropism of the virus and allow strains
that previously only affected livestock (eg, avian, swine) to infect human cells.

(Choice B) The influenza lipid bilayer envelope is generated from host cells during viral
replication. Because it is composed of host cell lipids, it is unlikely to be significantly altered by
viral mutations.

(Choices C, D, and E) Following influenza attachment and endocytosis, the viral bilayer
