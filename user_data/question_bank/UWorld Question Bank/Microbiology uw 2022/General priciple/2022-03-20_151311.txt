Educational objective:

Phenotypic mixing refers to coinfection of a host cell by 2 viral strains, resulting in progeny
virions that contain nucleocapsid proteins from one strain and the unchanged parental genome
of the other strain. Because there is no change in the underlying viral genomes (no genetic
exchange), the next generation of virions revert to their original, unmixed phenotypes.
