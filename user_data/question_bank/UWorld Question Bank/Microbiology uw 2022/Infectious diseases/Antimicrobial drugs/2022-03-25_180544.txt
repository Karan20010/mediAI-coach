Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) is a combination of 2 bacteriostatic antibiotics
that act synergistically to inhibit bacterial tetrahydrofolate formation, resulting in bactericidal
activity. It has a broad spectrum of activity against many aerobic gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria and is commonly used for urinary tract infections, Pneumocystis jiroveci
pneumonia, and Nocardia infections.

Common adverse effects of TMP-SMX include rash, nausea and vomiting, and folate
deficiency (with prolonged use). In addition, hyperkalemia is a common adverse effect that
can occur, regardless of dose. Similar to the actions of amiloride (a potassium-sparing
diuretic), trimethoprim blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the distal tubule and collecting
duct. This reduces transepithelial voltage and impairs sodium-potassium exchange,
leading to reduced potassium excretion and hyperkalemia.

This effect is often magnified in the elderly population, those with renal failure, or those given
other potassium-sparing diuretics (eg, spironolactone, amiloride), ACE inhibitors (eg,
lisinopril), or angiotensin receptor blockers (eg, losartan). This patient with hypertension and
diabetes may be receiving an ACE inhibitor, which further increases his risk of developing
hyperkalemia.
