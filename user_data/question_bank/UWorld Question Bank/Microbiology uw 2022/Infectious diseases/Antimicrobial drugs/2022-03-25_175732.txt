(Choices A, B, and E) Mutations in viral DNA polymerase can lead to acyclovir resistance,
but differences in TK are the best explanation for the observed results. Drug degradation rate
and viral protease activity are not responsible for differences in viral susceptibility to acyclovir.

(Choice D) TK is an enzyme produced in infected cells, but it is not present in the capsid.

Educational objective:

Monophosphorylation of acyclovir by a viral thymidine kinase is the first (and rate-limiting) step
in conversion of acyclovir to its active triphosphate form. Acyclovir and related drugs (eg,
famciclovir, valaciclovir) are more effective against herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster
virus than cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus.
