(Choice B) The therapeutic index (ie, [toxic dose]/[effective dose]) is a measurement of the
relative safety of a drug; it is an intrinsic property upon which drug dosing regimens are
devised. A relatively high therapeutic index is usually necessary to prevent toxicity with
extended-interval dosing because the administered drug amounts lead to higher serum levels
than seen with more frequent dosing regimens.

(Choice C) Most drugs exhibit a sigmoid-shaped dose response curve that shows no effect
until a threshold concentration is exceeded. After this occurs, the effects increase with
increasing drug concentration until a saturation threshold (ie, maximum effect) is reached. In
contrast to this sigmoidal response, the risk of cancer following exposure to ionizing radiation
shows a linear dose-response relationship (ie, risk increases proportionately with increased
exposure).

(Choice D) The threshold dose is the lowest dose at which drug effects are first seen. In this
case, both dosing regimens cause serum concentrations to rise above the MIC. Furthermore,
the extended-interval dosing regimen results in less total time above the MIC but still
demonstrates effectiveness. Therefore, a low dosing threshold does not explain the

effectiveness of extended-interval dosing.
