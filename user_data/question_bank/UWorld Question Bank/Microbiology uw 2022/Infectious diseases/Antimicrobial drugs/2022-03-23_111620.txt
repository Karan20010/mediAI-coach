Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves direct cell-to-cell contact

between two adjacent bacteria. It allows for the propagation of genetic elements that confer
beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance, the ability to use new metabolites, or the ability
to tolerate a difficult microenvironment. The transferred genetic element is a conjugative
plasmid (separate from the genome) or an integrated conjugative element (present in the
genome).

Conjugation begins when proteins encoded by the conjugative element aggregate on the
plasma membrane of the donor bacteria, forming a pilus (a hair-like appendage). The pilus
elongates until it attaches to an adjacent bacterium and then progressively shortens, which
pulls the bacteria together. The plasmid DNA in the donor cell is then nicked and relaxed, and
a single DNA strand is transferred through the mating bridge from the donor to the recipient
bacterium. A complimentary DNA strand is then generated in each bacterium, which
completes the plasmid transfer.

Conjugation is a major mechanism for Shigella antibiotic resistance. A single Shigella
plasmid encodes resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, sulfonamides,
streptomycin, and trimethoprim. Other plasmids encode resistance to azithromycin and
fluoroquinolones. Risk of resistant strains is greatest in patients with HIV and/or men who
have sex with men, but antibiotic susceptibility testing is required for all infections due to high
rates of resistance across patient populations.

Educational objective:
Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves the formation of a pilus and the
direct passing of genetic material from one bacterium to another. It is a common source of
antibiotic resistance and environmental adaptation. The other forms of bacterial horizontal
gene transfer are transduction (viral vector) and transformation (uptake of free DNA).
