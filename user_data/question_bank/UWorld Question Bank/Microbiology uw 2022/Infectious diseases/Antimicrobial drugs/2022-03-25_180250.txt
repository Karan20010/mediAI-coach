A 43-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to low-grade fevers and
malaise. She has a history of lung transplantation due to cystic fibrosis and had 2 episodes of
cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia over the past few months, which were treated with ganciclovir.
Temperature is 37.6 C (99.7 F). Physical examination is unrevealing. Chest x-ray and
urinalysis are negative for infection. Polymerase chain reaction testing for CMV in blood

12 shows elevated CMV levels consistent with CMV viremia. Given the recurrent episodes of
viremia, genotype analysis is performed and demonstrates ganciclovir-resistant CMV. The

hypomagnesemia. Which of the following agents is the most likely cause of these side

18 effects?
