Educational objective:

Fluoroquinolones can form insoluble chelate complexes with polyvalent cations (eg, calcium,
iron, aluminum, magnesium) in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to impaired absorption. This
effect can be seen with over-the-counter antacids containing calcium, magnesium, and/or
aluminum salts and in patients taking calcium salts (eg, calcium carbonate, calcium citrate) for

treatment of osteoporosis.
