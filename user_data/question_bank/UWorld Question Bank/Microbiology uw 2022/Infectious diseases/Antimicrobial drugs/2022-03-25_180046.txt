The bacterial cell wall is composed of rigid, cross-linked peptidoglycan pentads on a
glucosamine backbone. Its primary purpose is to provide external structure to the bacterium
and prevent disfigurement or lysis in changing osmotic gradients. In this experiment, the
assumption of a spherical shape in an isotonic solution and lysis in a hypotonic solution
indicate disruption of the bacterial cell wall. Several classes of antibiotics target cell wall
synthesis, including fosfomycin, vancomycin, penicillins, and cephalosporins (eg,
cefuroxime).
