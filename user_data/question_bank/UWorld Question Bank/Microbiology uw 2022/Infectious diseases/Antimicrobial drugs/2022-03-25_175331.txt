to all tested antibiotics. He received intravenous ciprofloxacin with improvement in his
symptoms and was subsequently discharged on oral ciprofloxacin. The patient has been
taking the antibiotic as prescribed, but over the past 2 days he has had recurrent fever and
dysuria. He takes diltiazem for palpitations, atorvastatin for hyperlipidemia, and an over-the-
counter antacid for frequent heartburn. Temperature is 37.3 C (99.1 F), blood pressure is
