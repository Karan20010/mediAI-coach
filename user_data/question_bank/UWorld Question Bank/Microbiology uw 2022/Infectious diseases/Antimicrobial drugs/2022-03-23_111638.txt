(Choices B and C) The two other forms of horizontal gene transfer are transduction and
transformation. Transduction involves the introduction of foreign DNA into a bacterial cell by a
virus or viral vector. Transformation involves the uptake of free DNA from the environment
through the cell membrane. Neither involves direct contact between bacterial cells or the
formation of pili.

(Choice D) Transposition involves the movement of a DNA sequence from one location to
another within the genome (frequently with duplication of the transposon), which often results
in genetic mutations due to incorrect DNA repair and/or insertional mutagenesis.

(Choice E) Vertical gene transfer is the transmission of genes from parent to offspring. This
occurs in bacteria when they divide by binary fission; it does not involve pili.
