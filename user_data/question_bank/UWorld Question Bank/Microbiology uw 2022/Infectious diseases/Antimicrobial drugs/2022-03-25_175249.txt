Trimethoprim (in bacteria), methotrexate (in human cells), and pyrimethamine (in some
protozoa) all prevent the reduction of folic acid to tetrahydrofolate (THF) by inhibiting
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Trimethoprim restricts bacterial growth through this
process and works particularly well in conjunction with the sulfonamides (eg,
sulfamethoxazole), which inhibit an earlier step in the bacterial folic acid pathway (see Choice
E); the combination of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole produces a "sequential blockade."

Methotrexate is a folate antimetabolite that targets rapidly proliferating human cells by halting
DNA synthesis through binding DHFR. Methotrexate is cell-cycle specific for the S phase as it
prevents synthesis of purines and thymine. Pyrimethamine is effective for treatment of
malaria and toxoplasmosis because it inhibits parasitic DHFR.
