This patient with HIV has fever, fatigue, hepatosplenomegaly, skin lesions, and pancytopenia;
these are consistent with disseminated histoplasmosis, as evidenced by the positive
Histoplasma antigen test. Amphotericin B is the drug of choice to treat many systemic
mycoses. It is also the most toxic antifungal medication.

The most dangerous adverse effect of amphotericin B is its nephrotoxicity; this is due to both
a decrease in glomerular filtration rate and direct toxic effects on the tubular epithelium.
Nephrotoxicity can lead to anemia (decreased erythropoietin production) and electrolyte
abnormalities. Hypokalemia and (less often) hypomagnesemia are common due to an
increase in the membrane permeability of the distal tubule. Hypokalemia can cause
weakness and arrhythmias. ECG findings in hypokalemia include T wave flattening, ST-
segment depression, prominent U waves, and premature atrial and ventricular contractions.
Profound hypokalemia can cause ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation.
