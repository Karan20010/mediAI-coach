The isolate of S. pneumoniae in the prior question had five penicillin-binding proteins identified,
whereas the isolate in the current question only has two. This indicates that three of the
penicillin-binding proteins have been altered in such a way that inhibits the binding of
ceftriaxone. Structural changes in penicillin-binding proteins that prevent ceftriaxone from
binding is one mechanism for ceftriaxone resistance.
