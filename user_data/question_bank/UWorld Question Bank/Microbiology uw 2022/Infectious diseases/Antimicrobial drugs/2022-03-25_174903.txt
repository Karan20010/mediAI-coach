This patient's fever, leukocytosis, right upper quadrant pain with positive Murphy sign, and
ultrasound findings (eg, gallstones, wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid) indicate acute
cholecystitis. Antibiotic therapy is often administered to prevent secondary infection (eg,
Escherichia coli, Klebsiella) due to biliary stasis, particularly in patients who have diabetes
mellitus or immunodeficiency.

The penicillin family of antibiotics (eg, piperacillin) contains a beta-lactam ring, which inhibits
peptidoglycan cross-linking and causes bacterial cell wall disruptions. Resistance is often due
to beta-lactamase, a bacterial enzyme that hydrolyzes and inactivates the beta-lactam ring.
The coadministration of a beta-lactamase inhibitor such as tazobactam prevents beta-
lactamase producing organisms from inactivating penicillins, which extends their spectrum of
activity (broadens the range of microbes that can be treated).

Some penicillin-derivative antibiotics (eg, late-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems) have
beta-lactam rings with additional chemical components, which make them partially or
completely resistant to beta-lactamases.
