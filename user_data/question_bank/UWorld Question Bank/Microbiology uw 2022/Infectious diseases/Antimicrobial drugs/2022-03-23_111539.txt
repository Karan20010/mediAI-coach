Conjugation is a form of horizontal gene transfer that involves direct cell-to-cell contact
between two adjacent bacteria. It allows for the propagation of genetic elements that confer
beneficial traits such as antibiotic resistance, the ability to use new metabolites, or the ability
to tolerate a difficult microenvironment. The transferred genetic element is a conjugative
plasmid (separate from the genome) or an integrated conjugative element (present in the
genome).
