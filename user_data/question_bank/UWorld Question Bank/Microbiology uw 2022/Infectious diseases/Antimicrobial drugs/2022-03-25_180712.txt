This patient's new genital rash and positive Tzanck smear are consistent with a primary
genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, likely due to HSV-2. Antiviral drugs for the
treatment of primary genital herpes include acyclovir, valacyclovir (acyclovir prodrug with better
oral bioavailability), and famciclovir. Acyclovir treatment during a primary episode can reduce
duration of viral shedding, time to lesional healing, constitutional symptoms, and local pain.
Chronic daily suppressive therapy (lower dose) can be used in patients who have recurrent
episodes.

In infected host cells, acyclovir (a nucleoside analog) is converted into acyclovir
monophosphate principally via virus-encoded thymidine kinase. Cellular enzymes then
convert the monophosphate into acyclovir triphosphate, which competes with deoxyguanosine
triphosphate for viral DNA polymerase. When acyclovir triphosphate becomes incorporated
into the replicating viral DNA chain, viral DNA synthesis is terminated.

Acyclovir does not significantly impact uninfected cells in vitro as uptake into these cells is
poor, phosphorylation in the absence of viral thymidine kinase is minimal, and cellular a-DNA
polymerase has significantly less affinity for acyclovir triphosphate than does viral DNA
polymerase.
