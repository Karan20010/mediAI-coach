= (Choice B) Probenecid, a uricosuric agent used for hyperuricemia with gout, blocks the renal

5 tubular excretion of penicillins and cephalosporins and is sometimes used to increase their

: serum level or prolong their half-life.

: (Choice C) Aminoglycosides inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by blocking the 30S ribosomal

10 subunit. Penicillins are often coadministered with aminoglycosides to aid in their entry into the
cell (penicillins disrupt the cell wall, which allow aminoglycosides to penetrate the bacteria).

(Choice D) Piperacillin is always administered intravenously so bioavailability is 100%.
15 Tazobactam inhibits beta-lactamase; it does not alter piperacillin metabolism or excretion.

17 (Choice E) Additive antimicrobial activity occurs when 2 different antibiotic classes are used in
combination, such as a fluoroquinolone (DNA gyrase inhibitor) with vancomycin (cell wall
synthesis inhibitor). Beta-lactamase inhibitors block an enzyme that destroys penicillins; they
do not independently provide antimicrobial activity so they are always used in combination with
penicillin-class agents.

Educational objective:
Beta-lactamase inhibitors (eg, clavulanic acid, sulbactam, tazobactam) prevent beta-lactamase
from inactivating penicillin class drugs, which extends the spectrum of their activity.
