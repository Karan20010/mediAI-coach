(Choice B) Inhibition of viral protease activity is the mechanism of action for drugs such as
indinavir, an antiretroviral used in HIV treatment.

(Choice C) Prevention of virion release from infected cells is the mechanism of action for
drugs such as neuraminidase inhibitors (eg, oseltamivir), which are used in the early treatment
of influenza.

(Choice D) Drugs such as enfuvirtide and maraviroc, antiretrovirals used in HIV treatment,
prevent viral entry into the target cells. Docosanol, a topical agent that prevents viral entry, is
sometimes used for herpes labialis, not genital HSV.

(Choice E) Upregulation of interferon synthesis in infected cells is accomplished by many
interleukins.

Educational objective:

Antiviral drugs currently recommended for the treatment of primary genital herpes include the
nucleoside analogs (eg, acyclovir). These are incorporated into newly replicating viral DNA
and ultimately terminate viral DNA chain synthesis.
