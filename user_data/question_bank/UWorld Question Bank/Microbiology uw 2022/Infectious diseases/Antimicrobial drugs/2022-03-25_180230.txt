(Choice A) AGs need to diffuse inside the cell to reach the ribosome. As a result, they are
often prescribed synergistically in combination with antibiotics affecting cell wall synthesis.
These include penicillins, which impact cell wall cross-linking, or vancomycin. Vancomycin is
also associated with ototoxicity, but it is a glycopeptide antibiotic that acts by directly inhibiting
peptidoglycan synthesis, not cell wall cross-linking (which occurs at a later stage of cell wall
synthesis). Although Enterococcus is generally resistant to AGs, these drugs are routinely
used as synergistic agents in combination with penicillins or vancomycin in patients with
enterococcal endocarditis; such combinations lead to improved bacterial killing and are the
standard of care for this condition.

(Choices B and C) Fluoroquinolones act on DNA gyrase to prevent DNA unwinding.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole affects folic acid synthesis. These antibiotics are not
classically associated with ototoxicity and are not used synergistically for enterococcal
endocarditis.

(Choice D) Daptomycin disrupts the bacterial membrane by creating transmembrane
channels that cause intracellular ion leakage and cellular membrane depolarization. Its main

side effects are myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.

(Choice F) tRNA charging refers to initial covalent bonding between tRNA and the
