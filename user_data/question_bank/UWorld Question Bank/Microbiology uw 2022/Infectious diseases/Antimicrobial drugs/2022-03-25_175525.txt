fluoroquinolone resistance. In addition, he had a positive initial clinical response. Loss of

bioavailability rather than antibiotic resistance.

(Choice C) Prostatitis due to sexually transmitted organisms is typically seen with Neisseria
gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis and is more common with younger rather than older
men. Reinfection with E coli via sexual contact is unlikely.

(Choice D) Ciprofloxacin is primarily cleared by renal excretion, and the dosage may need to
be decreased in patients with significant renal impairment. However, switching this patient
from parenteral to oral antibiotic therapy would not affect renal drug clearance.

(Choice E) Diltiazem is a cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inhibitor (not inducer) that can cause
increased systemic levels of numerous drugs, leading to drug toxicity (eg, myopathy due to
statins). Regardless, ciprofloxacin is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, and drug levels
are unlikely to be significantly affected by P450 inducers.
