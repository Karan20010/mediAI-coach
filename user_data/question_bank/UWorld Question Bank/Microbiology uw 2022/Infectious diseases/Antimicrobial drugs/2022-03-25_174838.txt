: dysuria and urinary frequency. Although urinalysis will reveal pyuria, no bacteria would be

to seen on urinary Gram stain because C trachomatous has no cell wall. Neither azithromycin

= nor doxycycline adequately treats enteric, gram-negative pathogens; therefore, neither is

is (Choice C) Fluconazole is often used to treat vaginal candidiasis, which can cause dysuria

: and is often linked to vaginal intercourse. However, most patients also have vaginal itching

is and soreness. The presence of urinary frequency, urgency, and pyuria/bacteriuria makes

bacterial cystitis more likely.

transmitted during sexual intercourse. Women infected with trichomonas often have dysuria
and frequency, but most also have a purulent, malodourous vaginal discharge. The presence
of pyuria/bacteriuria on urinalysis makes acute bacterial cystitis more likely.
