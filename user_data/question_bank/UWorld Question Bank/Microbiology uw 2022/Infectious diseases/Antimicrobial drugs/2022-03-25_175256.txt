+ 4 (Choice A) Bacitracin prevents mucopeptide transfer into the growing cell wall, thereby

inhibiting bacterial cell wall synthesis.

. 6
z (Choice B) Imipenem binds to penicillin binding proteins, thereby inhibiting the final step of
9 peptidoglycan synthesis (crosslinking) in bacterial cell walls. It is administered in combination

with cilastatin, which prevents renal metabolism of imipenem by competitively inhibiting
12 dehydropeptidase on the renal tubule brush border.

14 (Choice D) Metronidazole forms cytotoxic intermediates (eg, nitroso radicals) within anaerobic
organisms that interact with DNA, disrupting the helical structure and breaking its strands.
17 RNA transcription and protein synthesis are inhibited, and the cell dies soon thereafter.

(Choice E) As a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), sulfamethoxazole
competes with PABA to inhibit dihydropteroate synthetase, one of the enzymes needed for
dihydrofolic acid synthesis. This is an intermediate step in the formation of THF.

Educational objective:

Trimethoprim, methotrexate, and pyrimethamine inhibit dihydrofolate reductase. Trimethoprim
restricts bacterial growth through this process, and works particularly well in conjunction with
sulfonamide, which inhibits an earlier step in the bacterial folic acid pathway.
