Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen with multiple
mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, including beta-lactamases, efflux pumps, and antibiotic-
modifying enzymes. Antibiotic-modifying enzymes add chemical groups (eg, acetyl, adenyl,
phosphate) to a target drug and are the most common mechanisms of aminoglycoside (eg,
gentamicin) resistance. Altered aminoglycosides have a reduced ability to bind to the 16S
ribosomal RNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit, leading to increased minimum inhibitory
concentrations and reduced bactericidal effects. Most antibiotic-modifying enzymes arise via
transfer of plasmids or transposons rather than chromosomal mutations.
