This patient's acute dysuria, urinary frequency/urgency, suprapubic tenderness, and
pyuria/bacteriuria indicate acute simple cystitis. Women are at greater risk than men due to
the short distance between the anus and vaginal introitus, which allows enteric bacteria to
contaminate the urethra and ascend into the bladder. Recent sexual intercourse is the
single greatest risk factor in otherwise healthy women.

Most cases of acute simple cystitis are caused by the enteric bacteria Escherichia coli.
However, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Staphylococcus saprophyticus are
also frequently isolated. Patients with no risk factors for resistant bacteria (eg, recent inpatient
hospitalization or antibiotic use) are generally treated empirically with 3-6 days of nitrofurantoin
or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) due to their excellent efficacy and low risk of
side effects.
