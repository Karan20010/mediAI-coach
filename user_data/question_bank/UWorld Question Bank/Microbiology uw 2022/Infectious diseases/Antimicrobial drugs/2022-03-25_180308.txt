Foscarnet is a pyrophosphate analog that is sometimes used for ganciclovir-resistant
cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. Foscarnet can chelate calcium. Moreover, foscarnet-
induced renal wasting of magnesium may lead to hypomagnesemia and a reduction in the
release of parathyroid hormone, which contributes to the hypocalcemic state. Both
hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia can promote seizures.
