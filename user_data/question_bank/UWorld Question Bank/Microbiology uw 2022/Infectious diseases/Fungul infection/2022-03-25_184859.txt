Educational objective:

Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the defense against invasive Candida
infection; therefore, patients with neutropenia (eg, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are at
high risk for invasive disease (eg, candidemia, meningitis). In contrast, T lymphocytes are
more important for prevention of superficial, mucocutaneous infection (eg, thrush).
