unresponsive on the sidewalk. Medical history is unknown. Temperature is 38.3 C (101 F),
blood pressure is 116/70 mm Hg, pulse is 108/min, and respirations are 26/min. Oxygen
saturation is 88% on 100% oxygen via face mask. The patient is ill-appearing, thin, and
disheveled with poor dentition. There are a few white patches on the oral mucosa, but no skin
rash is present. Lung auscultation reveals bilateral crackles. There are healed abdominal
scars from a previous surgery. The abdomen is soft with no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly.
Chest x-ray reveals bilateral interstitial infiltrates. A silver-stained bronchoalveolar lavage

specimen is shown in the image.
