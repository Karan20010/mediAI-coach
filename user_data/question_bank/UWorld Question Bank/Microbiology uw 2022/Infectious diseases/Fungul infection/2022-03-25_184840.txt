C albicans is a human commensal organism that may cause mucocutaneous infection in

otherwise healthy individuals but rarely causes invasive disease. Protection against infection

is mediated by the following:

Intact epithelium: Candida triggers toll-like receptors on epithelial cells to release
proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the area; epithelial cells also
release beta-defensins, which provide antifungal activity.

Resident macrophages/monocytes: Penetration of epithelial cells by fungal hyphae
causes resident macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines that recruit lymphocytes,
monocytes, and neutrophils to the area of infection. T helper lymphocytes specific for
Candida antigens help drive the epithelial and macrophage response, and are important
for prevention of superficial Candida infection (eg, oral/esophageal, cutaneous,
vulvovaginitis).

Neutrophils: Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the protection against
invasive Candida (eg, candidemia, deep tissue infections). Neutrophils kill Candida by
releasing reactive oxygen species, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, and beta-defensins.
They are also the only immune cell that is able to prevent germination of Candida yeasts
into penetrating hyphae.
