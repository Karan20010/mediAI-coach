This patient with acute myeloid leukemia underwent induction chemotherapy prior to
hematologic stem cell transplantation. Because induction chemotherapy ablates bone marrow
cells, patients typically develop profound pancytopenia within a few days. Although anemia
can cause dyspnea and fatigue, and thrombocytopenia can cause bruising and bleeding, the
most life-threatening issue following induction chemotherapy is severe neutropenia, which
dramatically increases risk of infection with virulent (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, gram-
negative rods) and less virulent (eg, Candida albicans) organisms.

In this case, the patient has a bloodstream infection with C albicans, a normal commensal of
the mouth, skin, and gastrointestinal tract. Although mucocutaneous Candida infections are
common in otherwise healthy individuals, invasive infection typically occurs only in those with
indwelling central catheters or significant neutropenia. Manifestations can include organ
abscesses (eg, kidney, heart, brain, eye, liver) and clusters of macular skin lesions.
