Mucormycosis should generally be treated with antifungal therapy and surgical debridement.
Amphotericin B is the initial drug of choice. It binds ergosterol in fungal cell membranes to
form holes. Resultant changes in membrane permeability lead to cell death. Renal toxicity is
the most notorious side effect of amphotericin B. The drug causes renal vasoconstriction and
a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. It may also act as a direct toxin on renal epithelial
cells, leading to acute tubular necrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and electrolyte disturbances.
Severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia (likely reflecting increased distal tubular
membrane permeability) can occur, with most patients requiring supplementation. Renal injury
may also lead to decreased erythropoietin production and produce a normochromic normocytic
anemia.

Patients with mucormycosis who respond to initial amphotericin therapy may be switched to
posaconazole. Liver function test monitoring is recommended in patients taking azoles.
