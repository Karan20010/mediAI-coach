This patient's 30-pack-year smoking history, low-grade fever, productive cough, normal pulse
oximetry, and pulmonary rhonchi suggest a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
exacerbation. Although expectorated sputum cultures are not routinely obtained in patients
with COPD exacerbation, they may help identify the underlying respiratory pathogen in certain
cases (eg, concern for drug-resistant organism). However, positive expectorated sputum
results often indicate contamination with oral flora rather than true infection.

This patient's sputum culture grew Candida albicans, an oval, budding yeast that forms true
hyphae ("germ tubes") when incubated at body temperature (37 C). C albicans is a normal
commensal of the skin and gastrointestinal tract that occasionally causes mucocutaneous
infection (eg, vulvovaginitis, cutaneous candidiasis) but rarely causes invasive disease (eg,
sepsis, chorioretinitis, endocarditis); invasive infection primarily occurs in those with significant
neutropenia or indwelling vascular catheters (which provide a portal of entry from the skin into
the bloodstream). Therefore, the presence of C albicans on a sputum sample almost always
indicates contamination with oral flora rather than true infection.

Other common oral contaminants (that almost never indicate true infection) include coagulase-
negative staphylococci and enterococci.
