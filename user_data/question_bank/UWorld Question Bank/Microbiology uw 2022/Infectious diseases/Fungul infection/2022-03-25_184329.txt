A 43-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to fever, chest pain, and
hemoptysis. He has a history of a hematologic malignancy for which he recently underwent a
cycle of chemotherapy. Laboratory studies show neutropenia due to the chemotherapeutic
agents. A nodule with surrounding hypoattenuation is revealed on chest CT. Galactomannan
and beta-D-glucan assays are elevated. Sputum cultures grow Aspergillus. The patient is
placed on intravenous amphotericin B. During the infusion, he develops headaches, rigors,
and hypotension. Over the next few days, there is a decline in renal function attributed to
amphotericin. These toxic effects are likely due to binding of the antifungal agent to which of
