Sporotrichosis is caused by Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus found in soil and
plant matter that may be traumatically inoculated into the skin (eg, thorn prick) during
outdoor activities (eg, gardening, landscaping). A mildly pruritic, erythematous, ulcerated
papule often forms at the inoculation site (eg, hand, forearm) within weeks. As the organism
spreads, additional lesions may develop along the draining lymphatic chain (ie, nodular
lymphangitis).

Biopsy of the lesions reveals mixed inflammation, including granulomas and neutrophilic
microabscesses in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. Stains for fungal organisms may
highlight rare, cigar-shaped yeast. The gold standard for definitive diagnosis is culture.

Sporotrichosis is typically limited to the skin and soft tissue, but disseminated infection may
develop in immunocompromised individuals. Itraconazole is the preferred treatment for
lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis.
