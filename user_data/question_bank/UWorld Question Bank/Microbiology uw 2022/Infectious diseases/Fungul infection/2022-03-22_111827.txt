Thrush is an oropharyngeal Candida albicans infection that usually presents with creamy
white, plaque-like lesions on the buccal mucosa, palate, tongue, or pharynx. The lesions can
be easily scraped off with a tongue depressor, revealing underlying erythematous mucosa.
The diagnosis is often made clinically, but microscopic examination will reveal budding yeasts
with or without pseudohyphae.

Candida albicans is a normal commensal of the human digestive tract that can cause
mucocutaneous infections when local microbial flora is disrupted (eg, antibiotic use) or the cell-
mediated immune response is impaired. Although Candida infections of the skin (eg, diaper
rash) and vulvovaginal region often occur in otherwise healthy individuals, oropharyngeal
infection is rare in the absence of antibiotics, chemotherapy, or inhaled corticosteroids. Young,
healthy individuals who develop thrush and have no clear inciting cause should be tested for
HIV, particularly when HIV risk factors (eg, multiple sexual partners) or symptoms of the virus
(eg, lymphadenopathy, weight loss) are present. A fourth-generation HIV antigen/antibody
test is typically used for screening.
