Aspergillus causes the following conditions:

Â¢ Invasive aspergillosis develops in immunosuppressed patients. The prolonged
neutropenia associated with leukemia and lymphoma treatment is a strong risk factor. It
most commonly affects the lung and can cause fever, pleuritic chest pain, and
hemoptysis. Aspergillus has a predilection for blood vessels and can spread
hematogenously, causing infection and infarcts involving the skin, paranasal sinuses,
kidneys, endocardium, and brain. Diagnosis is made by light microscopy, which reveals V-
shaped, narrow, septate hyphae invading the tissue. Voriconazole is used to treat invasive
aspergillosis.

Aspergillomas are Aspergillus fungus balls that grow in old lung cavities (eg, produced
by tuberculosis or bronchiectasis). They are limited to the preexisting cavity; invasion of
the surrounding lung tissue is rare in immunocompetent patients. Aspergillomas are often
surgically removed.

Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis occurs in asthma and presents with wheezing
and migratory pulmonary infiltrates. Increased serum IgE and increased titers of
antibodies against Aspergillus are characteristic. Treatment is with corticosteroids.
