(Choice B) Leukoplakia is a benign lesion of the tongue caused by hyperplasia of the

squamous mucosa that can evolve into dysplasia — carcinoma in situ — invasive carcinoma.

Leukoplakia appears as white patches or plaques on the oral mucosa. However, these lesions

cannot be easily removed with scraping (unlike thrush).

(Choice C) Coxsackievirus causes herpangina, which is usually seen in infants and children.
It is characterized by high fever, sore throat, and yellowish or grey-white papulovesicular
lesions on the throat (tongue lesions are rare). Coxsackievirus also causes hand, foot, and
mouth disease, which is characterized by tongue macules, vesicles, and ulcers. However, it is
also usually associated with a vesicular or macular skin rash.

(Choice D) Microscopy of herpes simplex virus (HSV) lesions will reveal multinucleated giant
cells. HSV usually causes multiple vesicular lesions on an erythematous base, not white
mucosal plaques.

(Choice E) Atrophic glossitis can be caused by vitamin B,, or folate deficiency. It is
characterized by atrophy of the filiform papillae leading to a smooth, glossy, erythematous
tongue.
