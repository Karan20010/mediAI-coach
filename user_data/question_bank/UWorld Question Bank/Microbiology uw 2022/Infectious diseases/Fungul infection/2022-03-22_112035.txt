This patient's symptoms are consistent with fungal rhinosinusitis. The biopsy shows fungal
hyphae branching at acute angles with septations, findings characteristic of Aspergillus
fumigatus. This fungus is widely distributed in the environment and commonly grows on
decaying vegetables. It is monomorphic, existing only in mold form (ie, multicellular hyphae).
