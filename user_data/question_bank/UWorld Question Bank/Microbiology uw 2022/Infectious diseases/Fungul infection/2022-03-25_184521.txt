Question: 1067137 Mark oe a Full Screen 2 Lab a
(Choice A) Azole antifungals do not bind directly to cell membrane sterols; they bind to the
enzyme that generates ergosterol. In contrast, amphotericin B binds to ergosterol, generating
pores in the cell membrane that lyse the cell; alterations to ergosterol's structure can impair
amphotericin B binding and lead to resistance, but would have no effect on azoles.

(Choice B) Filamentous fungi such as Rhizopus and Aspergillus can cause ischemic necrosis
by binding to components of the vascular wall (eg, basement membrane, extracellular matrix).
This feature is not targeted by azole antifungals.

(Choice D) Echinocandin antifungals inhibit the synthesis of beta-D-glucan, a branched
polysaccharide that serves as a crucial cross-linking element in the cell wall of many fungi.
Mutations to the enzyme that produces beta-D-glucan can lead to echinocandin resistance.

(Choice E) The hyphal form is required for Candida to be pathogenic, and Candida with and
without the hyphal form is typically seen in tissue cultures during infection. However,
mutations to the gene that triggers the hyphal form would not alter sensitivity to azole
antifungal medications.

Educational objective:
Azole antifungal medications (eg, fluconazole) block the fungal enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-
