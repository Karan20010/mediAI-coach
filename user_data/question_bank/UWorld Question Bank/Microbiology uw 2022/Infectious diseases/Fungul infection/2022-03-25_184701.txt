This homeless patient has hypoxia, bilateral interstitial infiltrates, and a positive silver stain
indicating likely Pheumocystis pneumonia (PCP), an atypical fungal infection caused by the
opportunistic pathogen P jirovecii. Inhalation of the organism leads to inoculation of the
alveolar space. Healthy individuals rarely develop symptoms as alveolar monocytes and
macrophages are stimulated by the cell-mediated immune response to rapidly clear the
organism. However, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, particularly those with
untreated AIDS (CD4 count <200/mm:), often cannot eliminate the pathogen.

PCP typically manifests with slowly worsening pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough, dyspnea),
hypoxia, and chest x-ray evidence of a diffuse, bilateral interstitial infiltrate. Because P sirovecii
cannot be cultured, diagnosis is made by identifying the organism in respiratory secretions
using specialized stains (eg, methenamine silver stain).

This patient also has oral pharyngeal candidiasis (white patches on the oral mucosa), an
opportunistic infection often seen in those with impaired cell-mediated immunity.
