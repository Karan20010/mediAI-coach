Mucor, Rhizopus, and Absidia species are saprophytic fungi present in the environment. They
are transmitted by spore inhalation and cause mucormycosis. Mucormycosis is very strongly
associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Patients with underlying immunosuppression (eg,
due to solid organ transplantation, hematologic malignancies, or glucocorticoid therapy) are
also at high risk.

Mucormycosis tends to affect the paranasal sinuses. Symptoms include facial and periorbital
pain, headache, and purulent nasal discharge. The fungi proliferate in the walls of blood
vessels and cause necrosis of the corresponding tissue. Black eschar (necrotic tissue) may
be seen on the palate or nasal turbinates.

Mucormycosis is diagnosed by light microscopy of a tissue specimen. Mucor, Rhizopus, and
Absidia fungi exist in mold form only. They form broad, nonseptate hyphae that branch at
wide, often 90Â° angles. Mucormycosis is treated by surgical debridement of necrotic tissue
and amphotericin B.
