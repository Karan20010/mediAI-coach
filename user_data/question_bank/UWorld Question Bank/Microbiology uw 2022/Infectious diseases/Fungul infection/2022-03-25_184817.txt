This patient underwent cytotoxic chemotherapy and subsequently developed a bloodstream
infection with Candida albicans, a small, elliptical, budding yeast. Visualization of
pseudohyphae, a chain of budding yeasts joined together with end-to-end at constrictions, is
an important diagnostic clue. C albicans is distinguished from other Candida species by its
ability to form germ tubes (true hyphae with no constrictions) when incubated at 37 C (98.6 F)
for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test).
