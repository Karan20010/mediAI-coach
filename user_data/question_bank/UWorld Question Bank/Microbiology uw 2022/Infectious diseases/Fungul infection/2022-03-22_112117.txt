â€œ3 (Choices B, D, and F) Blastomyces, Coccidioides, and Histoplasma are dimorphic fungi.

- 4
They grow as molds in nature but exist in yeast form in humans (Coccidioides exists in

7 8 endospore form at body temperature). As a result, hyphae would not be seen in biopsy

. 7

specimens.

(Choice C) Candida albicans is a component of normal human mucous membrane flora. On
light microscopy, it appears as an oval, budding yeast with pseudohyphae (ie, not true hyphae
but rather elongated yeast cells).

(Choice E) Cryptococcus neoformans, an oval, budding yeast with a thick capsule, causes
meningitis and lung infections in AIDS. India ink stain of cerebrospinal fluid shows a wide,
clear zone around the cell corresponding to the unstained capsule.

(Choices G and H) Malassezia furfur and Microsporum canis can cause cutaneous fungal
infections. They do not typically cause rhinosinusitis.

(Choice |) Rhizopus and Mucor form broad, ribbon-shaped, nonseptate hyphae that branch at
right or wide angles. They cause mucormycosis, which typically presents as a paranasal
infection in immunocompromised patients or those with diabetes mellitus. However,
Aspergillus can also cause rhinosinusitis identical in presentation to mucormycosis. The
presence of narrow hyphae with septations makes invasive aspergillosis more likely.
