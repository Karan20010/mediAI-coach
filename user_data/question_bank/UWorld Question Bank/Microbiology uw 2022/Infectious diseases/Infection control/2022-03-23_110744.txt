Hand hygiene by health care workers is the single most important measure to reduce the risk
of transmission of microorganisms between patients. It includes handwashing with soap and
water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers that do not require water. Proper handwashing
technique involves washing all surfaces of the hands and fingers with soap and water for at
least 15 seconds, drying with a disposable towel, and using the towel to turn off the faucet.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should cover all surfaces of the hands and fingers and be
allowed to dry. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing before and after
touching a patient, before aseptic procedures, and after contact with body fluids or patient

surroundings.
