Approximately 250,000 nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs) are estimated to occur in
the United States each year. Prior to the 1980s, the leading cause was gram-negative aerobic
organisms such as Escherichia coli that spread from primary infections in the genitourinary or
gastrointestinal tract. However, the increasing use of intravascular catheters, which provide
a portal of entry for skin flora to reach the bloodstream, has led to a shift in the underlying
microbiology of BSI; most cases are now caused by skin commensals such as coagulase-
negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus.

BSI is most common in those who have long-term (>12 days) central venous access as this
provides sufficient time for skin flora to colonize the internal/external lumen of the catheter, to
replicate within a biofilm of host (fibrin) and bacterial (glycoprotein) components, and to
subsequently spread to the bloodstream. BSI should be suspected when a patient with an
intravascular catheter develops new-onset fever or bacteremia.
