In a patient with HIV and multiple ring-enhancing lesions being treated empirically for
toxoplasmosis, lack of a clinical or imaging response after 1-3 weeks of therapy should raise
suspicion for other conditions requiring further evaluation, especially given negative
Toxoplasma serologies. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is the
second most common cause of ring-enhancing lesions with mass effect in HIV. Classically,
large, solitary lesions are more likely to suggest PCNSL rather than toxoplasmosis; however,
multiple lesions (as seen in this patient) are also common in PCNSL.

PCNSL is a diffuse, large-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin that usually occurs as a
late complication of HIV infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is identified in almost all cases.
Diagnosis of PCNSL can be made by positive EBV polymerase chain reaction analysis in the
cerebrospinal fluid. Definitive diagnosis requires brain biopsy. Although EBV infections in
general can be associated with abnormal T-lymphocytes (eg, atypical lymphocytes), T cell
infiltration is not commonly seen on brain tissue biopsy of patients with HIV who have PCNSL.
T-lymphocytes are the malignant cells in AIDS-associated T-cell lymphoma, not PCNSL
