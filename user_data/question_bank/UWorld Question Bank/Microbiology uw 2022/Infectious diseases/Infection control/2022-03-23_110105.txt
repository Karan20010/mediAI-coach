(Choice A) Amphotericin (with flucytosine) is used to treat cryptococcal meningitis, a well-
known cause of meningitis in AIDS patients that typically manifests with nausea, vomiting,
nuchal rigidity, and altered mental status. Ring-enhancing lesions are not commonly seen on
imaging as cryptococcomas are rare. Amphotericin can treat invasive aspergillosis; however,
central nervous system aspergillosis more classically presents as an abscess (eg, single ring-
enhancing lesion), is often accompanied by pulmonary (eg, cough, dyspnea) and orbital
manifestations in patients with HIV, and is primarily treated with voriconazole rather than
amphotericin.

(Choice B) Ampicillin is typically used to treat Listeria infection. L monocytogenes can cause
meningitis in immunosuppressed patients but does not typically form ring-enhancing lesions.

(Choice C) Ganciclovir is used in the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV
primarily causes symptomatic disease (eg, retinitis, esophagitis, pneumonia) in the
immunosuppressed. Characteristic manifestations of central nervous system involvement
include polyneuropathy, transverse myelitis, and encephalitis.

(Choice D) In developing countries, mycobacterial infection causes brain tuberculomas
(nodular granulomatous lesions), but this would be less likely in the United States.

Tuberculoma treatment typically includes 5 antitubercular drugs rather than only isoniazid and
