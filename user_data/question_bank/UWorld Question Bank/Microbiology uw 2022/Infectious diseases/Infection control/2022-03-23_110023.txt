Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan with a worldwide distribution. The cat
is the definitive host of this protozoan, with humans infected following ingestion of food or
water contaminated with cat feces (containing oocysts) or undercooked meat (containing
pseudocysts). Immunocompromised individuals exposed to T gondii can develop encephalitis
with multiple necrotizing brain lesions, resulting in fever, headache, altered mental status, and
focal neurologic findings. In this patient with HIV who has seizures and multiple ring-
enhancing lesions with mass effect, cerebral toxoplasmosis is a likely diagnosis. First-line
treatment (which can be given empirically, particularly if test results are unrevealing) includes a
combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (or pyrimethamine and clindamycin in case
of sulfa drug hypersensitivity) along with leucovorin (folinic acid).
