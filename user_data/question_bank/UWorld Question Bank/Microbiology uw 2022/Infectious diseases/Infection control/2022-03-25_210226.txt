Alcohols, including ethanol and isopropanol, are widely used as disinfecting agents in the
health care setting. They are commonly used to clean the skin before immunization or
venipuncture and to disinfect external surfaces of equipment. They function by disorganizing
the lipid structure in membranes, causing them to be leaky, and by denaturing cellular
proteins. Alcohols require the presence of water for maximal activity and are most effective at
60%-90% concentration. They are rapidly bactericidal and also tuberculocidal, fungicidal, and
virucidal, but do not destroy bacterial spores.
