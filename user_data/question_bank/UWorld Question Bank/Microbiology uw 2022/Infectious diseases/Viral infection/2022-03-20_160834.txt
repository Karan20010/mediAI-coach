cerebral cortices, ventriculomegaly, and subcortical calcifications. Viral RNA of a neurotropic

virus causes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells in the developing fetus, leading to disruption
of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Which of the following viruses most
likely caused this patient's in utero infection?
