This patient with HIV likely has cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis (intranuclear and
intracytoplasmic inclusions), which, in some patients (eg, with ganciclovir resistance or
refractory thrombocytopenia), is treated with foscarnet. Foscarnet is a pyrophosphate analog
that does not require intracellular activation. It directly inhibits both DNA polymerase in
herpesvirus and reverse transcriptase in HIV. Foscarnet must be administered intravenously.
In addition to treating ganciclovir-resistant CMV infections, foscarnet is useful in patients who
have acyclovir-resistant herpesvirus infections. Ganciclovir, a guanine nucleoside analogue
structurally similar to acyclovir, is often used for CMV infections. However, it requires
intracellular conversion by a virally encoded kinase and then by cellular kinases (Choice C).
