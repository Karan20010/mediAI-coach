These patients have a febrile illness with signs of meningitis (eg, neck stiffness, headache)
and encephalitis (eg, confusion, seizure, tremor, focal deficits), raising strong suspicion for an
outbreak of arbovirus meningoencephalitis (eg, West Nile virus, La Crosse virus).
Arboviruses are small RNA viruses that are harbored by birds and small mammals and are
transmitted to humans via biting arthropods (eg, mosquitos, ticks, fleas), primarily during the
summer months when arthropod populations are at their peak.

Infections in otherwise healthy individuals usually result in an asymptomatic low-level viremia
that is cleared within a week by the humoral antibody response. In contrast, patients who
cannot mount a rapid, effective antibody response (eg, elderly, immunocompromised) may
have persistent and more severe viremia; these individuals often develop a severe flu-like
illness (eg, fever, headache, fatigue, arthralgias) that may progress to meningitis and/or
encephalitis.

Most arbovirus infections are self-limited and resolve with supportive care, but some cases of
meningoencephalitis are fatal. Because no vaccines are currently available for North
American arboviruses (Choice E), prevention primarily relies on the elimination of vector
arthropod breeding grounds (eg, stagnant water) and the early identification of infected
arthropods (and birds) so that aerosolized insecticide can be sprayed.
