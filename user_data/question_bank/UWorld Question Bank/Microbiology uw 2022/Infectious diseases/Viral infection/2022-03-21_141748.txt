Educational objective:

Rotavirus is a common cause of self-limited childhood diarrhea in unvaccinated individuals. It
infects villous enterocytes in the duodenum and proximal jejunum and results in villous
blunting, proliferation of secretory crypt cells, and a loss of brush border enzymes; this results
in watery diarrhea without fecal leukocytes.
