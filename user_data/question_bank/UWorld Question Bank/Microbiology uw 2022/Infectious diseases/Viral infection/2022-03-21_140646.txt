(Choice A) Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, caused by coxsackievirus, presents with oral
ulcers and a nonpruritic rash of variable morphology (eg, macular, vesicular) on the hands and
feet. This patient's pruritus and lack of oral involvement make this diagnosis less likely.

(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults typically causes severe pharyngitis (primary
infection) or a localized cluster of perioral vesicles (reactivated infection). Although HSV can
cause a disseminated vesicular rash, this typically occurs in immunocompromised patients
(eg, HIV). In addition, the rash is painful with vesicles in the same stage of development.

(Choice C) Human herpesvirus 6, which causes roseola infantum, most commonly presents
with fever followed by a diffuse, maculopapular rash in young children. Vesicles would not be
seen, and infection in immunocompetent adults is rare.

(Choice D) Parvovirus causes erythema infectiosum. Prodromal symptoms (eg, fever,
headache) are followed by the development of malar erythema (slapped-cheek rash) and a
reticular truncal rash. This patient's vesiculopustular rash makes parvovirus unlikely.

(Choice F) Variola virus causes smallpox, which is characterized by a vesiculopustular rash
with lesions at the same stage of development, unlike in this patient. Moreover, smallpox has
been eradicated due to vaccination.
