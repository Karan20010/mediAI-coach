Parvovirus is a nonenveloped single-stranded (ss) DNA virus with an increased incidence in
children and teachers, as most individuals are infected during school outbreaks. Infection in
adults can present with an acute, symmetric arthralgia/arthritis involving hands, wrists,
knees, and/or feet, with or without rash.

Fetal infection with parvovirus can lead to interruption of erythropoiesis, causing profound
anemia and congestive heart failure. Fetal congestive heart failure can cause pleural
effusions, pericardial effusions, and ascites. The findings on fetal autopsy (pleural effusion

with secondary pulmonary hypoplasia, and ascites) represent fetal hydrops.

Parvovirus is also responsible for erythema infectiosum ("fifth disease"), which presents with a
"slapped cheek" appearance in children, and aplastic crisis in patients with sickle cell anemia.
