JC virus is a polyomavirus, typically acquired in childhood, that causes life-long, latent
infection of the kidney and lymphoid organs. Most adults have serologic evidence of exposure
but remain asymptomatic. However, those with severe immunosuppression, particularly
patients with advanced AIDS, are at risk for viral reactivation with spread to the brain. The
virus attacks oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce myelin, causing a severe
demyelinating disease called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

PML typically presents with slowly worsening confusion, ataxia, motor deficits, and seizure.
Brain MRI usually shows multifocal areas of white matter demyelination with no mass effect
or enhancement. Diagnosis is confirmed with JC virus PCR testing of the cerebrospinal fluid;
brain biopsy is rarely required. There is no specific treatment for PML, but patients with HIV
who develop the disease are treated with antiretroviral therapy to reduce immune
suppression. This often helps stabilize neurologic symptoms.
