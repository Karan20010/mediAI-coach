Educational objective:

In the United States, bats are the main source of rabies (only transmitted by mammals).
Agitation and spasms progressing to coma within weeks of exposure is strongly suggestive of
rabies encephalitis. Prophylactic vaccination is recommended for individuals at high risk for
exposure to rabid animals or their tissues. The approved rabies vaccines consist of various
rhabdovirus strains grown in tissue cell culture and then inactivated.
