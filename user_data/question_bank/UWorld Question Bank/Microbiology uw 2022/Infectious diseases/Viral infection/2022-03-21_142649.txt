This patient traveled to Brazil and subsequently developed a high fever and hemorrhagic
manifestations (eg, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, mucosal bleeding). The likely diagnosis is
dengue, a Fiavivirus infection transmitted by female Aedes mosquitoes. Dengue virus
causes approximately 400 million infections per year and is especially prevalent in tropical and
subtropical regions of Asia and South America (eg, Brazil).

Manifestations typically arise 4-7 days after transmission and include sudden-onset high
fever, headache, retroorbital pain, arthralgia, and myalgia. Hemorrhagic manifestations such
as petechiae, purpura, or mucosal bleeding (eg, epistaxis, melena) often occur within days of
symptom onset and can be life-threatening. Laboratory evaluation frequently reveals
thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and hemoconcentration.

Because Aedes mosquitoes also transmit the viruses that cause yellow fever, Zika, and
chikungunya, there are often simultaneous outbreaks in endemic areas during the rainy
seasons when mosquito populations peak. Patients are also at high risk for coinfection with
multiple mosquito-borne viral pathogens during these periods.
