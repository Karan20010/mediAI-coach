(Choices A, C, and F) No antirabies drugs targeting specific viral pathways (eg, cellular
entry) are available, and interferon is not used in rabies management.

(Choice D) Some live attenuated rabies vaccines have been used in wild animal populations,
but none are currently recommended in humans. The herpes zoster (shingles), varicella, and
yellow fever vaccines are live attenuated.

(Choice E) Toxoid (prepared from formalin- or heat-treated toxin) can induce humoral
immunity against the corresponding toxin without producing serious toxic effects. However,
rabies does not appear predominantly toxin-mediated. The tetanus-(reduced) diphtheria
vaccine contains inactivated bacterial toxoids.
