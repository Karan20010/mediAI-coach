(Choices A and D) Odynophagia (painful swallowing) associated with linear esophageal
ulcers due to CMV infection is seen in patients with HIV. Retinitis is one of the most common
manifestations of CMV infection in patients with HIV.

(Choice B) Disseminated CMV can cause diarrhea and hepatitis in the
immunocompromised. In this patient, the combination of a positive hepatitis B surface
antibody with a negative hepatitis B surface antigen and a negative hepatitis B core antibody
reflects immunization against hepatitis B, not prior hepatitis B infection.

(Choice E) A vesicular skin rash is seen in association with herpes simplex or herpes zoster

virus infection.

(Choice F) CMV pneumonitis typically occurs after organ transplantation.
