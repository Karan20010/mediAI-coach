This patient developed a transient febrile illness and rash while traveling in Puerto Rico and
now has severe, persistent polyarthritis. The likely cause is chikungunya, an alphavirus
infection transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Outbreaks are common in tropical and
subtropical regions (eg, Caribbean, Africa, Asia, Indian and Pacific Oceanic islands) during the
rainy seasons; travelers may bring the illness home.

Manifestations generally begin a few days after transmission and include high fever; diffuse
maculopapular rash; and severe, symmetric polyarticular arthralgia that begins in the small
joints of the hands and feet and may move proximally. Transient lymphopenia and
thrombocytopenia are common. Fever and rash usually abate within a few days, but many
(>70%) patients have persistent arthralgia, polyarticular arthritis (particularly of the wrists,
hands, or ankles), or tenosynovitis for weeks or months. Because Aedes mosquitoes also
transmit the viruses that cause dengue, yellow fever, and Zika, coinfection can occur.
