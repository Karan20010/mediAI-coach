(Choice G) Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) can cause acute, exudative
pharyngitis that is associated with fever, headache, and abdominal pain in school-aged
children. It can also be accompanied by scarlet fever, a diffuse "sandpaper"-textured rash
most prominent in skinfolds (eg, groin, axillae, antecubital fossa).
