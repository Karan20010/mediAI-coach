(Choice A) Borrelia burgdorferi is a spirochete that is the causative agent in Lyme disease,
transmitted to humans through the bite of the /xodes tick. Manifestations include erythema
migrans (target lesion), febrile illness with headaches and joint pains, and central nervous
system or cardiac involvement. Pneumonia would be unusual.

(Choice C) Epstein-Barr virus causes infectious mononucleosis (malaise, pharyngitis,
splenomegaly).

unpasteurized milk, but it is unlikely to cause a febrile illness with retroorbital headaches and
pneumonia.

and diarrhea.
