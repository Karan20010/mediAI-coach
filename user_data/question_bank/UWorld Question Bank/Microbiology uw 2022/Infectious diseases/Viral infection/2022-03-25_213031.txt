(Choice A) RNase enzymes present in the extracellular milieu as part of the innate immune
defense against viruses rapidly destroy unprotected mRNA. Therefore, mRNA vaccines are
generally encased in a carrier compound (eg, lipid bilayer) to protect it and to efficiently deliver
it into host cells.

(Choice C) mRNA vaccines provide protective immunity only when the MRNA is translated to
its encoded protein and expressed on the surface of host cells. An adaptive immune response
targeting the mRNA directly would not provide protective immunity, as the viral
capsid/membrane protects the genome while the viron remains extracellular.

(Choice D) Retroviruses (eg, HIV) can convert their genomic RNA to DNA and then integrate
into the host genome. However, mRNA is transcribed to protein and then degraded within host
cells; it is not integrated into the genome.

Educational objective:

mRNA vaccines deliver MRNA molecules encoding foreign protein into the cytoplasm of host
cells (particularly antigen presenting cells that avidly engulf the associated carrier compound).
The mRNA is then translated by ribosomes and displayed on the cell surface, leading to a
robust adaptive immune response.
