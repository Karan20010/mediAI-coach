This patient has classic symptoms of primary varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection, a
vaccine-preventable illness that causes varicella, or chickenpox. Primary infection usually
occurs in children but can develop at any age, with severe illness occurring more often in
adolescents and adults.

Transmission of VZV occurs via aerosolized droplets or direct contact, and a prodrome of
fever, headache, and malaise typically develops after a 2-week incubation period. Within a
day, a pruritic, maculopapular rash develops and evolves into pustules then vesicles. A
characteristic finding in varicella is the development of successive crops of lesions on the
face, trunk, and extremities, as seen in this patient with lesions in different stages of
development (eg, crusted lesions, new vesicles). Vesicles crust over and resolve within 1-2
weeks. Once the primary infection has resolved, patients are at risk for reactivated infection
(ie, herpes zoster).
