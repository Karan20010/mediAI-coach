reduces risk of other comorbidities (eg, pneumonia, encephalitis), recovery time, and length
of hospital stay. No other vitamin is linked to measles.

(Choice B) Vitamin B., or pyridoxine, deficiency can result in oral abnormalities (eg,
stomatitis, cheilosis) and irritability. Vitamin B, is given therapeutically in specific
circumstances (eg, to decrease adverse side effects of isoniazid therapy, to decrease
homocysteine levels).

(Choice C) Deficiency of vitamin B,., or cobalamin, results in macrocytic anemia;
hypersegmented neutrophils on peripheral smear; and neurologic signs, such as
paresthesias. Patients with a vegan diet are at risk as this vitamin is only found in animal
products.

(Choices D, E, and F) Like vitamin A, vitamins D, E, and K are fat-soluble vitamins and often
present in patients with fat malabsorption (eg, cystic fibrosis). Vitamin D deficiency results in
bony abnormalities, such as rickets and osteomalacia. Vitamin E deficiency results in
hemolytic anemia and neurologic abnormalities (eg, ataxia). Vitamin K deficiency presents
with easy bleeding (eg, easy bruising, gum bleeding, hematuria, hematochezia).
