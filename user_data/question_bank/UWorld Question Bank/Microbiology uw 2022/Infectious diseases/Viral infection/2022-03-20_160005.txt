This patient's presentation is consistent with roseola infantum, which is most commonly
caused by human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). Febrile seizures can be caused by any febrile
illness, and HHV-6 is one of the most common causes. However, most patients with HHV-6
infection do not develop seizures. Primary symptoms include high fever for 3-5 days
followed by an erythematous maculopapular rash. The rash usually starts on the trunk
and spreads to the face and extremities. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation, and
the infection is typically benign and self-limited.
