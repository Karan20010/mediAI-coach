Adenovirus infection is a common, usually self-limiting, disease caused by a double-
stranded DNA genome that is transmitted via direct contact, fecal-oral route, or respiratory
droplets. Adenovirus infection occurs year-round and in outbreaks in crowded quarters (eg,
day care centers, camp dormitories, military barracks).

Viral replication in epithelial cells can give rise to varying manifestations of disease based on
serotype, with upper respiratory involvement as the most common. Pharyngoconjunctival
fever is characterized by the acute onset of fever, cough, congestion, pharyngitis, and
conjunctivitis. Physical examination usually reveals an erythematous oropharynx with
bilateral, follicular conjunctival injection and serous discharge. Pneumonia occurs in a small
percentage of patients, such as the child with focal crackles.
