Influenza vaccination is administered either by injection (inactivated [killed] vaccine) or nasal
spray (live attenuated vaccine). Each seasonal influenza vaccine contains antigens (or
attenuated virions) from 3 or 4 influenza A and B virus strains. Antigens from multiple influenza
types are included in the vaccine because antibodies against 1 strain confer limited or no
protection against the others. Annual vaccination is recommended due to waning
effectiveness over time and because circulating strains of influenza change from year to year.
All individuals age >6 months should be immunized, especially health care workers and those
at risk of serious complications such as the elderly, patients with chronic illness (eg, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease), and immunocompromised individuals.

Inactivated versions of the influenza vaccine stimulate the formation of neutralizing
antibodies against the hemagglutinin antigen of included strains. Subsequent exposure to
a strain of influenza included in the vaccine will not result in infection because the antibodies
bind to hemagglutinin, thereby preventing hemagglutinin from attaching to the sialic acid
receptor on host respiratory epithelial cells (preventing viral entry).
