This patient has many of the classic features of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced
mononucleosis, including fever, profound fatigue, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytosis (with
atypical lymphocytes), and splenomegaly (palpable spleen tip). EBV is typically transmitted
from an asymptomatic virus shedder to a susceptible individual through saliva transfer (eg,
kissing).
