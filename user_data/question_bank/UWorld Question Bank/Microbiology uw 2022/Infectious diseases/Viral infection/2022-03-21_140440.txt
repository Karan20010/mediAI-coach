(Choice A) HBcAg is not detectable in serum as it is normally sequestrated within the HBsAg
coat.

(Choice B) HBsAg is the first virological marker detected in the serum after inoculation,
preceding both the elevation of serum aminotransferases and the onset of clinical symptoms.
It remains detectable during the entire symptomatic phase of acute hepatitis B and suggests
infectivity. It is not the most ominous marker in the pregnant woman, however.

(Choice D) Anti-HBc appears in the serum shortly after the emergence of HBsAg and remains
detectable long after the patient recovers. The IgM fraction signals the acute phase of
disease, whereas the IgG fraction signals recovery from the disease. Because IgM anti-HBc is
present in the "window period," it is an important tool for diagnosis when HBsAg has been
cleared and anti-HBs is not yet detectable. Thus IgM anti-HBc is the most specific marker for
diagnosis of acute hepatitis B.

(Choice E) Anti-HBe suggests the cessation of active viral replication and low infectivity.

(Choice F) Anti-HBsAg IgG appears in the serum after either successful HBV vaccination or
the clearance of HBsAg and remains detectable for life. It serves as an indicator of
noninfectivity and immunity. However, there is a time lag between the disappearance of

HBsAg and the appearance of anti-HBs in the serum, which is termed the "window period."
