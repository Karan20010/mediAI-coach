Patients with advanced AIDS can have reactivation of JC virus, which causes progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy. This condition usually presents with slowly progressive
confusion, ataxia, and motor deficits. Brain MRI reveals multifocal areas of white matter
demyelination with no mass effect or enhancement.
