Educational objective:

The HIV genome contains 3 major structural genes that are translated as polyproteins and
subsequently cleaved by host protease (env gene products) or viral protease (gag-po/ gene
products) into the individual proteins that compose the HIV virus. Protease inhibitors block
viral protease from cleaving gag-pol polyproteins, which results in the formation of immature

virions that are noninfectious.
