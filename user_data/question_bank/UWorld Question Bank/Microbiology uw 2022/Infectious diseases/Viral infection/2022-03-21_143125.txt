(Choice A) Varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are examples of

Question Id: 1374 Previous New

enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses. VZV exposure in the second trimester increases
the risk of fetal varicella syndrome (presents as limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, chorioretinitis).
Congenital CMV can cause jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, and periventricular calcifications.
Congenital CMV (and other TORCH infections), when severe, can also cause hydrops due to
multiorgan failure. However, parvovirus is the most common infectious agent causing hydrops
and is especially likely given the mother's history of transient arthralgias during pregnancy.

(Choice B) Rubella is an enveloped ssRNA virus. Congenital rubella infection
characteristically causes cataracts, sensorineural deafness, and a "blueberry muffin" rash
(purpuric lesions signify dermal erythropoiesis).

(Choice C) Group B streptococcus (GBS) is a gram-positive coccus that is present in chains
and colonizes the female genital and gastrointestinal tracts. Fetuses exposed to GBS via the
amniotic fluid during labor, or with rupture of membranes, can develop sepsis a few days after
birth. GBS exposure does not cause hydrops fetalis.

(Choice E) Congenital toxoplasmosis leads to chorioretinitis, hydrocephalus, intracranial
calcifications, microcephaly, and seizures. It is caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan,

Toxoplasma gondii.
