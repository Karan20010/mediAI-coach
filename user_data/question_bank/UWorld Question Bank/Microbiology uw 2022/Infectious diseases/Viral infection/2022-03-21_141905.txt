Educational objective:

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) commonly infects B cells, stimulating them to proliferate continuously
("transformation" or "immortalization"). EBV is an oncogenic virus that promotes polyclonal B
cell proliferation and heterophile antibody production. The heterophile antibody test is
sensitive and highly specific for EBV infection.
