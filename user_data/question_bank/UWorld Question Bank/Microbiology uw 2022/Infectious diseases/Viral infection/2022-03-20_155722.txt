macrophage lineage. Irradiation helps reduce this risk. Other causes of heterophile antibody-
negative mononucleosis-like syndromes include human herpesvirus-6, HIV, and
toxoplasmosis.

(Choice A) Coxsackie A viruses cause aseptic meningitis and herpangina (fever, posterior
pharyngeal gray vesicles/ulcers) in children.

(Choice D) Acute hepatitis C (HCV) rarely causes symptoms. Transfusion-acquired HCV can
cause chronic hepatitis, but highly sensitive blood donor screening tests have led to low
transmission rates. Atypical lymphocytosis is less common with HCV than with EBV or CMV.

(Choice E) JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a central
nervous system viral infection seen in immunocompromised patients. Clinical manifestations
include hemiparesis, visual field defects (eg, hemianopsia), and cognitive impairment.

(Choice F) Parvovirus B19 causes erythema infectiosum, a childhood illness characterized by
red, flushed cheeks ("slapped cheeks" appearance). The virus can also cause aplastic crises
in patients with sickle cell anemia and hydrops fetalis in the fetus.

Educational objective:
The Monospot test is positive in most cases of Epstein-Barr virus-associated mononucleosis.
