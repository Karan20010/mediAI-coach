(Choice A) Genital herpes simplex virus causes acute episodes of painful vesicles and ulcers,
which are not present in this patient. In addition, microscopy of herpes shows multinucleated
cells.

(Choice B) Human herpesvirus 8 in immunocompromised patients causes Kaposi sarcoma,
which typically presents with nontender, discolored (eg, pink, purple, red) papules on the
extremities, face, and genitalia. Biopsy shows whorls of spindle cell proliferation and
extravasated red blood cells.

(Choice C) Condyloma acuminata (due to human papillomavirus) are typically soft, verrucous
anogenital lesions without a central indentation. Microscopy shows papillomatosis and
perinuclear cytoplasmic vacuolation (koilocytosis).

(Choice E) Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, classically presents with a painless
genital ulcer in its primary stage. Secondary syphilis can cause condyloma lata, which are
pale papules and plaque-like genital lesions. Although the diagnosis is normally confirmed
through serologic testing, microscopy would show spirochetes on darkfield examination rather
than molluscum bodies in keratinocytes.
