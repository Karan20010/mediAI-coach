(Choice A) Fulminant viral hepatitis is rare but can occur with any of the hepatitis viruses (A,
B,C, D, or E). Therefore, vaccination against HBV would not eliminate fulminant viral
hepatitis.

(Choice B) There is currently no vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Vaccinating a
patient against HBV would not prevent HCV infection.

(Choice D) Hepatocellular carcinoma is most commonly associated with HCV or HBV
infection. Although universal vaccination against HBV would reduce the incidence of
hepatocellular carcinoma, it would not eradicate the condition.

(Choices E and F) HBV and HCV can cause extrahepatic manifestations such as
membranous glomerulopathy and mixed cryoglobulinemia due to the formation of circulating
immune complexes. Although vaccination against HBV would reduce the incidence of these
extrahepatic manifestations, it would not completely eliminate them.
