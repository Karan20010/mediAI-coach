This patient has a new infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), presenting with elevated
hepatic aminotransferases and confirmed on HCV RNA assay. The risk of HCV infection is
elevated in patients on hemodialysis due to their frequent exposure to blood products, and
these individuals are regularly screened for HCV.

Immediately after exposure to HCV, some patients develop jaundice, abdominal pain, and
elevated aminotransferases (ie, acute hepatitis C), whereas others remain asymptomatic.
Although some patients clear the virus spontaneously within 6 months of initial infection, the
majority (50%-80%) remain persistently viremic and develop chronic HCV unless they receive
treatment with antiviral medication (Choice E). Viral persistence is even more likely in elderly
or immunosuppressed individuals (eg, end-stage renal disease, HIV infection).

Most patients with chronic HCV exhibit nonspecific disease manifestations, including fatigue,
abdominal pain, and elevations in aminotransferases. Approximately 20% of chronic HCV
infections lead to cirrhosis, which takes decades (25-30 years) to develop. Of those with HCV-
related cirrhosis, a small minority develop life-threatening hepatic decompensation (eg,
esophageal variceal bleeding, ascites) or hepatocellular carcinoma (Choices B and C). Given
this patient's age and comorbidities, he is unlikely to survive long enough to develop cirrhosis

or carcinoma.
