Educational objective:

Infants born to HBeAg-positive mothers have a high risk of acquiring perinatal hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection. Infected neonates have high levels of HBV replication and are at high risk for
chronic infection, but are usually asymptomatic or have only mildly elevated liver function tests.
