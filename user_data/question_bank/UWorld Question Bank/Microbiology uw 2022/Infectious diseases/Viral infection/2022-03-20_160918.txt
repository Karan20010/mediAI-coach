(Choices A, B, and E) Cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and varicella
zoster virus (VZV) are double-stranded DNA viruses that can be transmitted in utero and
cause CNS abnormalities in the fetus. Typical CMV findings include hearing loss,
chorioretinitis, jaundice, and periventricular calcifications. When transmitted in utero, HSV and
VZV can cause diffuse cutaneous lesions and severe brain destruction; hypoplasia of the limbs
and eyes is also commonly seen with fetal VZV infection.

(Choice C) Parvovirus B19 is a single-stranded DNA virus that infects and destroys erythroid
progenitor cells and can result in fetal hydrops when the infection is contracted during
pregnancy.

(Choice D) Rubella virus is a single-stranded RNA virus that typically presents with cardiac
defects, hearing loss, and cataracts.
