A 42-year-old man comes to the emergency department due to fever, abdominal pain, and
explosive diarrhea. He has a history of HIV but has not been taking any medications. BMI is
18.2 kg/m2. Abdominal examination is notable for right-sided tenderness to palpation.

Laboratory results show a CD4 cell count of 38/mm:, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. A CT
scan of the abdomen reveals colitis. Colonoscopy reveals areas of erosions and ulcerations;
pathology demonstrates cells with viral intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. Antiviral
therapy is initiated to treat the colitis with an intravenous agent that does not require
intracellular activation and is known to bind in vitro with viral-encoded enzymes such as DNA
polymerase, RNA polymerase, and reverse transcriptase. Which of the following agents did
this patient most likely receive?

©) A. Acyclovir
(©) B. Foscarnet
