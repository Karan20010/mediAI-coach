Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most common viral opportunistic infection of the
gastrointestinal tract in patients with advanced AIDS. Initial infection with CMV is usually
asymptomatic or similar to Epstein-Barr virus-induced mononucleosis. As with all members of
the herpesvirus family, latent infection is established after resolution of the initial infection.
Reactivation can occur at any time but is most common in the setting of immunosuppression.

In patients with HIV, CMV colitis is the second most common reactivation syndrome after
CMV retinitis. Patients with CMV colitis have fever, anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal
pain. The pain may be vague initially but becomes more localized as the disease progresses.
Colonoscopy shows mucosal erythema, erosions, and ulcerations. Histologic examination of
biopsy specimens will reveal acute and chronic inflammatory changes, vasculitis, and large
cells with large, ovoid nuclei containing centralized intranuclear basophilic inclusions
(owl's eye appearance).
