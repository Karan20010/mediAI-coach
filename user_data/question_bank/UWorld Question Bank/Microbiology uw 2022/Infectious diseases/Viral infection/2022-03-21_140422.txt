Educational Objective:

Vertical transmission of hepatitis B from pregnant females to the unborn child can occur in
women with active hepatitis B infection. The presence of HBeAg (a marker of viral replication
and increased infectivity) in the mother greatly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the
virus. Because of this concern, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B are
passively immunized at birth with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active

immunization with recombinant HBV vaccine.
