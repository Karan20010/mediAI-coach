Individuals who do not have premalignant epithelial lesions are at very low risk of EBV-
associated epithelial cancers like NPC.

(Choice A) Adenovirus causes acute upper respiratory infection with pharyngitis, coryza, otitis
media, bronchitis, and/or pneumonia. It is not associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

(Choice B) Coronavirus is one of the most common causes of upper respiratory tract infection
(eg, common cold) but has no association with nasopharyngeal or other cancers.

(Choices C and E) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) are also
herpes viruses; as such, they cause acute infection followed by latent disease. Although CMV
can reactivate in immunocompromised individuals (eg, HIV, post-transplantation) and cause
severe end-organ disease (eg, retinitis, gastroenteritis), it is not an oncogenic virus. HHV-8
reactivation also primarily occurs in immunocompromised individuals and is associated with
Kaposi sarcoma.

(Choice F) The BK and JC viruses are members of Polyomaviridae and cause life-long latent
infections in the kidney. BK reactivation can cause nephropathy in renal transplant recipients,
and JC virus causes progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (primarily in patients with
advanced HIV).
