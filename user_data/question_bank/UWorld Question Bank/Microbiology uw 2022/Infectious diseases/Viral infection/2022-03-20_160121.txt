This asymptomatic patient with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against hepatitis A virus
(HAV) likely had a prior infection with HAV. In children age <6, HAV infection is most often
(>80%) silent or subclinical ("anicteric,"‚Äù with no jaundice observed). Less frequently, it can
present as an acute, self-limited illness characterized by jaundice, malaise, fatigue, anorexia,
nausea, vomiting, and right upper-quadrant pain. Clinical disease is typically more severe
(70% of symptomatic patients with jaundice) in adults (some of whom develop an aversion to
smoking, for unclear reasons), although in the United States most adults with anti-HAV IgG
antibodies have never experienced an icteric illness. Liver failure and death due to HAV are
extremely rare (<0.5% of cases) (Choice E).
