Biopsy of the ulcerative tonsil lesion in this patient with persistent throat pain shows malignant
cells with atypical mitotic figures and keratin pearls, findings consistent with head and neck
mucosal squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).

Although most head and neck cancers are linked to tobacco and excessive alcohol use,
patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (eq, tonsil, base of tongue) often lack traditional
risk factors. Instead, oropharyngeal cancer is frequently associated with human
papillomavirus (HPV) exposure, particularly in younger patients. HPV-positive HNSCC
primarily affects the oropharynx, possibly due to the higher concentration of lymphatic tissue
facilitating viral processing. The most common causative subtypes are HPV-16 and 18, which
are covered by the HPV vaccine.

HPV is a nonenveloped, double-stranded DNA virus that infects cutaneous and mucosal
tissues. Some strains (eg, HPV-1, HPV-2) cause skin warts. Others (eg, HPV-6, HPV-11)
cause anogenital papillomas or papillomas that affect the upper respiratory tract (ie, recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis). High-risk strains (eg, HPV-16, HPV-18) produce proteins (E6,
E7) that prevent apoptosis, promote cellular proliferation, and cause genetic instability; they
are also linked to cancer of the cervix, vulva, anus, and penis.
