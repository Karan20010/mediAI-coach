(Choice A) Patients with advanced AIDS are at risk for disseminated Mycobacterium avium
complex, which is often associated with diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. However,
acid-fast staining organisms and necrotizing and non-necrotizing granulomas are typically
seen on biopsy.

(Choice B) Cryptosporidium is a protozoan parasite that causes watery diarrhea in both
immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, it primarily affects the small
intestine, not the colon. Oocysts can be identified in the stool using microscopy with modified
acid-fast stain; biopsy will show basophilic parasites attached to the mucosal brush border.

(Choice C) Candida albicans is a normal part of human flora that often causes oropharyngeal
and esophageal infections in patients with advanced AIDS. However, Candida and other
yeasts (eg, Histoplasma capsulatum) are a rare cause of colitis.

(Choice E) Clostridium difficile is an exotoxin-producing, anaerobic bacterium that can cause
severe colitis, most commonly after antibiotic use. Patients usually have fever, abdominal
pain, leukocytosis, and diarrhea. Endoscopy is not usually needed but often reveals mucosal

pseudomembranes.
