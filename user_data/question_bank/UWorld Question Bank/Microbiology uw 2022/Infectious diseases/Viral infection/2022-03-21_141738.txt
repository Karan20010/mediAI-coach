Rotavirus is a segmented, nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA virus that is primarily
transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in children
worldwide and typically presents in those age <5 with acute, self-limited fever and watery
diarrhea that may lead to dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Rotavirus vaccination is
protective and has resulted in a dramatic reduction in disease incidence.

Rotavirus invades the villous epithelium of the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Infection
causes diarrhea via multiple mechanisms including villous blunting (loss of absorptive
capacity), proliferation of secretory crypt cells (Secretory diarrhea), and reduced brush border
enzymes (accumulation of unmetabolized disaccharides in the small intestine lumen).
Rotavirus-induced diarrhea is noninflammatory; therefore, fecal leukocytes and erythrocytes
are not typically seen. Repeat infections are often less severe than initial infection due to the
generation of protective secretory IgA against rotaviral antigens.
