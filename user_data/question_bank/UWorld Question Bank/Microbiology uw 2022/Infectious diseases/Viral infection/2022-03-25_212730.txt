oice A e Influenza viral genome consists of segmented RNA, which is translated
predominantly into individual proteins rather than a large polyprotein product. HIV protease
inhibitors (eg, darunavir) are used to counteract HIV polyprotein cleavage mediated by viral

protease.

(Choice B) Foreign (viral) protein synthesis can be inhibited by a- and B-interferons, which
induce the synthesis of proteins that have an antiviral effect. These antiviral proteins promote
the degradation of RNA and halt protein translation in virally infected cells only.

(Choice C) Impairment of viral RNA replication is accomplished by the reverse transcriptase
inhibitors used to combat HIV (eg, abacavir, tenofovir, zidovudine).

(Choice D) Amantadine (limited use in influenza management due to viral resistance) impairs
uncoating or disassembly of the influenza A virion after host cell endocytosis. Oseltamivir does
not operate via the same mechanism of action. Currently, amantadine is mainly used in
Parkinson disease as it increases dopamine release (unclear mechanism).

Educational objective:

Oseltamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor useful in the treatment and prevention of both
influenza A and B virus infections. This medication impairs the release of newly formed virions
from infected host cells and impairs viral penetration of mucous secretions that overlie the
