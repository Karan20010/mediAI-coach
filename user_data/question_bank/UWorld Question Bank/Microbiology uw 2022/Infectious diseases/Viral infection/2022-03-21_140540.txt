be accelerated (not blunted) T-lymphocyte activity against secondary infection due to display
of cross-reacting viral antigens on major histocompatibility complexes of infected cells (Choice
B).

(Choice A) Antigenic drift is a minor change in viral structure that makes neutralizing
antibodies formed during previous infection less effective. This can increase the risk of
reinfection and lead to outbreaks. Antigenic drift is frequently seen with the influenza virus, but
is not prominent with the dengue virus.

(Choice D) Dengue virus inoculation size is not strongly correlated with severity of illness
compared to many other viral infections (eg, influenza, hepatitis B).

(Choice E) Viral superinfection can occur when hepatitis D virus infects a patient with active
hepatitis B virus infection. Although superinfection can cause severe hepatitis (eg, elevated
transaminases, systemic symptoms, high fever), the presence of the shock syndrome and
hemorrhagic manifestations shortly after travel to South America makes dengue more likely.
Hepatitis D is uncommon in the western hemisphere unless patients are in a high-risk category
(eg, injection drug user).

There are 4 different serotypes of dengue virus. Repeat infection occurs when a person is
