Most cases of infectious mononucleosis (IM), caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are
associated with serum heterophile antibodies that agglutinate with erythrocytes from
unrelated species (eg, horse erythrocytes in the Monospot test, sheep erythrocytes in the
classic Paul-Bunnell test). The agglutination test may be negative at the beginning of the
infection and can be repeated later for confirmation. Because the Monospot (horse
erythrocyte agglutination) test was negative on 2 separate occasions in this patient with a
mononucleosis-like syndrome (fever, fatigue, splenomegaly, atypical lymphocytosis), his
symptoms are unlikely to be due to EBV; the lack of sore throat and lymphadenopathy is also
atypical for classic EBV-associated IM (Choice C).

In immunocompetent patients with a heterophile antibody-negative mononucleosis-like
syndrome, the most likely diagnosis is cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Pharyngitis and
lymphadenopathy are seen less commonly than with EBV. CMV can be acquired during the
transfusion of leukocyte-laden blood products, as the virus infects leukocytes of granulocyte-
macrophage lineage. Irradiation helps reduce this risk. Other causes of heterophile antibody-
negative mononucleosis-like syndromes include human herpesvirus-6, HIV, and
toxoplasmosis.
