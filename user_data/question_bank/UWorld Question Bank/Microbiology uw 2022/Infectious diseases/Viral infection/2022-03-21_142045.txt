Educational objective:

Nasopharyngeal cancer is endemic in southern China due to genetic and dietary factors that
promote nasopharyngeal epithelial pre-malignant lesions. In almost all cases, malignant
transformation occurs due to infection of premalignant cells with Epstein-Barr virus and the
subsequent expression of oncogenic viral proteins.
