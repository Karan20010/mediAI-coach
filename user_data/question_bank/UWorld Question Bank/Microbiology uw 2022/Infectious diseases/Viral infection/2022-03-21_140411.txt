Vertical transmission of hepatitis B from pregnant females to the unborn child can occur with
active hepatitis B infection. Typically, such transmission takes place during the passage of the
fetus through the birth canal, but transplacental infection can also occur. This is especially
common in those women who developed acute hepatitis B infection in the third trimester.

The presence of HBeAg (a soluble protein that is a marker of viral replication and increased
infectivity) in the mother significantly increases the risk of vertical transmission of the virus.
Were this woman HBeAg negative, her neonate's risk of infection would be 20%. If she were
HBeAg positive, however, her neonate's risk of infection would be 95%. Moreover, should the
infant become infected, his chance of progression to chronic hepatitis is 90%. Because of this
concern, the newborns of all mothers with active hepatitis B are passively immunized at birth
with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), followed by active immunization with recombinant
HBV vaccine.
