This infant was exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) during delivery. Mother-to-child
transmission most commonly occurs during delivery, but transplacental infection can also
occur. Maternal viral load and HBeAg status are the strongest risk factors for infant infection.
Infants born to HBeAg-positive women (as in this case) have a >90% chance of acquiring
infection, whereas the chance is less in infants born to HBeAg-negative women.

Viral replication occurs rapidly in infected infants due to immune system immaturity in
newborns. As a result, infected infants have high viral loads and HBeAg levels. Despite this
high level of replication, infants enter an immune-tolerant phase of chronic HBV infection in
which they are asymptomatic and have normal or only mildly elevated liver function tests.

Over time, chronically infected newborns are at high risk of progression to cirrhosis and
hepatocellular carcinoma. The chance of progression to chronic hepatitis B is 90% without
treatment, much higher than the chance of progression in older children and adults.
Administration of hepatitis B vaccine and immunoglobulin as soon as possible after delivery
can prevent chronic infection.
