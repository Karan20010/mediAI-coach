vaccine that can be administered to susceptible individuals. The protective effect generated
by this vaccine most likely involves which of the following mechanisms?

A. Enhanced extracellular RNase enzyme production (1%)
YB. Expression of viral protein by antigen-presenting cells (56%)

C. Formation of antibodies targeting viral MRNA (35%)

D. Integration of viral MRNA into the host genome (6%)
