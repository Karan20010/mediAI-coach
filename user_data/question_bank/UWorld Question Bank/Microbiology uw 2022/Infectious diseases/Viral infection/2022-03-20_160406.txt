(Choice A) Coxsackievirus is the leading cause of hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which is
characterized by low-grade fever, oral macules/vesicles, and a macular/papular/vesicular rash
on the hands, feet, and extremities. This virus does not typically cause malignant
transformation.

(Choice B) Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can also cause HNSCC; however, it is most specifically
implicated in the nasopharynx, rather than the oropharynx. The classic triad of
nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a neck mass, nasal obstruction, and a unilateral, persistent
middle ear effusion due to obstruction of the eustachian tube.

(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus causes latent infection in the sensory nerves. Itis
associated with vesicular lesions of the orolabial mucosa, not tonsillar ulcers, and does not
cause HNSCC.

(Choice D) HIV increases the risk of many types of cancer due to immune dysregulation. The
risk of cancers related to underlying infections, such as human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi
sarcoma), HPV, EBV, and hepatitis B and C viruses (hepatocellular carcinoma), is particularly
increased. However, oropharyngeal cancer is most tightly linked to underlying HPV infection
even in the setting of HIV.
