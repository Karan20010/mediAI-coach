(Choices A and D) Adenovirus most commonly causes pharyngitis with conjunctivitis and
fever. Parainfluenza virus is the most common cause of croup (laryngotracheobronchitis),
which presents with a barky, seal-like cough and inspiratory stridor. Both viruses cause
bronchiolitis far less commonly than RSV does.

(Choice B) Bordetella pertussis infection in infants classically causes upper respiratory
symptoms (eg, rhinorrhea, congestion) with progression to a whooping cough and bouts of
coughing and posttussive emesis. In contrast to this patient's examination, the lungs are
usually clear to auscultation.

(Choice C) Pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae typically presents with fever,
cough, and rales and wheezing on examination. However, M pneumoniae usually affects
children age >5 years and is a rare cause of bronchiolitis.

(Choice F) Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of lobar pneumonia in
children and presents with fever and cough. However, examination typically reveals focal
rales, not diffuse findings, as seen in this patient.
