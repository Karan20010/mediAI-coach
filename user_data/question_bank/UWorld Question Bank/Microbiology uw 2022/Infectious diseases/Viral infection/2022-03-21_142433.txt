Educational objective:

Q fever is a zoonotic infection that occurs in farm workers exposed to waste from cattle and
sheep. Its causative agent is Coxiella burnetii. A patient with exposure to waste from farm
animals who develops a nonspecific illness (myalgias, fatigue, fever [>10 days], retroorbital
headache) with a normal leukocyte count, thrombocytopenia, and increased liver enzymes
should be evaluated for acute Q fever infection.
