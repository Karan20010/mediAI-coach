Hepatitis E virus is an unenveloped, single-stranded RNA virus spread through the fecal-oral
route. Infection with HEV occurs primarily in young and middle-aged adults living in Asia, sub-
Saharan Africa, and Mexico, with an average incubation period of 6 weeks. While the virus is
shed in the stool during the acute illness, the disease is typically self-limited and not
associated with either chronic liver disease or a carrier state. HEV antigen or HEV RNA can
be detected in the stool or liver in the earliest stages of infection (when the patient is
asymptomatic). Later, serum transaminases and IgM anti-HEV titers rise in association with
Clinical illness. The most concerning feature of hepatitis E is the high mortality rate observed
in infected pregnant women.
