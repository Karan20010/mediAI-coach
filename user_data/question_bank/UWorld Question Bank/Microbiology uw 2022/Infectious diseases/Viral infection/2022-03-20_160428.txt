A 29-year-old woman comes to the office due to 2 weeks of severe, progressive joint pain in
her hands, wrists, and ankles. The pain started in several fingers and spread over the course
of a day to more joints. It is so severe that she is unable to perform daily activities, and
ibuprofen provides only partial relief. The patient has no medical conditions but developed a
high fever and diffuse rash on her trunk and extremities during a trip to Puerto Rico 2 weeks
ago. Evaluation at a local medical facility was negative for malaria, and her fever and rash
resolved spontaneously after a few days. She does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs
and is in a monogamous relationship with her husband. Temperature is 37 C (99 F), blood
pressure is 122/70 mm Hg, and pulse is 86/min. On physical examination, the patient has
pink, moist oropharyngeal mucosa; no rash; clear lungs; normal heart sounds; and no
abdominal organomegaly. Periarticular swelling and tenderness are noted in the wrists,
ankles, and interphalangeal joints of her hands. Range of motion in these joints is decreased
due to pain. Laboratory testing reveals lymphopenia. Which of the following is the most likely
cause of this patient's joint pain?

©) A. Acute joint inflammation from crystal deposition

©) B. Autoantibody-mediated inflammatory arthritis
