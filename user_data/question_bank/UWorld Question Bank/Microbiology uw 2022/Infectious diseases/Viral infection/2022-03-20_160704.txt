(Choice A) Gout causes recurrent, acute joint inflammation due to monosodium urate crystal
deposition. However, most cases are monoarticular and occur in lower extremity joints.

(Choice B) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are
autoantibody disorders that cause symmetric, inflammatory polyarthritis. Patients generally
develop morning stiffness followed by joint swelling in the fingers, wrists, and toes; this
migrates in SLE and progresses to eventual joint destruction in RA. The presence of a febrile
illness while traveling and persistent nonmigratory joint pain makes an infection like
chikungunya more likely than an autoantibody-mediated inflammatory arthritis.

(Choice C) Reactive arthritis is a rare condition that primarily follows a gastrointestinal (eg,
Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) or genital (eg, Chlamydia) bacterial infection.
Manifestations typically include an asymmetric oligoarthritis that often affects the knees. This
patient's febrile illness while traveling and symmetric polyarthritis make chikungunya more
likely.

(Choice D) Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. \nitial symptoms
usually include fever; malaise; and a spreading, annular rash (erythema migrans). Several
months or years later, late manifestations such as monoarticular arthritis of the knee or

asymmetric oligoarthritis can develop.
