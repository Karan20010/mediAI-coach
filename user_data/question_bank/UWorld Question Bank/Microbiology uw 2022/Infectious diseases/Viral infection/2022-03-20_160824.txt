A 24-year-old woman, gravida 1 para 0, at 26 weeks gestation comes to the emergency
department due to abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding. She recently emigrated from
Bolivia and reports no prior medical problems. The patient's only medication is a daily
multivitamin. Immunization status is unknown. The patient spontaneously delivers a stillborn
fetus with multiple congenital malformations. Fetal autopsy reveals microcephaly with thin
cerebral cortices, ventriculomegaly, and subcortical calcifications. Viral RNA of a neurotropic
virus is detected in body fluids of the mother and the fetus. Transplacental transmission of this
virus causes apoptosis of neural progenitor cells in the developing fetus, leading to disruption
of neuronal proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Which of the following viruses most
likely caused this patient's in utero infection?

(©) A. Cytomegalovirus

©) B. Herpes simplex virus
© C. Parvovirus B19

©) D. Rubella virus

©) E. Varicella zoster virus
