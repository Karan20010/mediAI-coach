The HIV genome contains 3 major genes (env, gag, and pol) that are transcribed as
polycistronic mRNA and translated into polyproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. The gag
and pol polyprotein products (gag-pol) are cleaved by HIV protease into individual HIV
enzymes and structural proteins.

Protease inhibitors inhibit HIV protease from cleaving the gag-pol polyproteins, which results
in the formation of immature, noninfectious virions due to impaired production of functional
viral proteins. Protease inhibitors are a common component of first-line HIV antiretroviral
therapy and are denoted by medications that end in "navir" (eg, darunavir, atazanavir,
ritonavir).
