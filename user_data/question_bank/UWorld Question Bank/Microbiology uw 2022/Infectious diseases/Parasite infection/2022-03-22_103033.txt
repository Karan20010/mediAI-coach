Phthirus pubis, the human pubic louse, is a translucent parasite approximately 1 mm long
with crab-like claws that allow it to grip pubic hair. Transmission usually occurs during sexual
contact whereby an infected individual transmits the louse to an uninfected individual by skin-
to-skin contact. Therefore, condoms are unable to prevent transmission (it is not transmitted
by fluids). Teenagers and young adults are affected most commonly due to higher numbers
of sexual partners.

Manifestations typically include intense pruritus in the pubic area with excoriations due to
scratching. Other hairy areas such as the axillae may be affected, but the scalp is typically
spared. Visualization of the louse or nits (oval, white, louse eggs on the hair shaft) confirms
the diagnosis. First-line treatment includes a topical permethrin cream to the affected area.
Permethrin blocks parasite sodium ion conduction in nerve cell membrane channels and
results in louse paralysis and death.
