Educational objective:

Strongyloides stercoralis is transmitted in tropical/subtropical climates when human skin
comes into direct contact with filariform larvae. The larvae penetrate the skin, enter the
bloodstream, pass through the lungs, and are swallowed into the digestive system. Common
manifestations include linear skin rash and irritative digestive/respiratory symptoms.
