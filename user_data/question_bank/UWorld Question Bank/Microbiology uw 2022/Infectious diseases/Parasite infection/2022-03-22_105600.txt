This immunocompromised patient has profuse watery diarrhea and stool studies revealing
acid-fast staining microorganisms. These findings are most likely due to infection with
Cryptosporidium parvum.

Cryptosporidium is a fecal-orally transmitted protozoan that most commonly causes
outbreaks in association with contaminated water; foodborne and person-to-person
transmission may also occur. Ingested oocytes travel to the small bowel where they release
sporozoites that attach to epithelial cells. Sporozoites mature intraluminally into meronts that
reinvade host cells (eg, auto-infection) as well as create new oocytes that are shed in feces.
These oocysts can be identified by modified acid-fast staining of stool specimens. Stool
PCR and immunofluorescent assay are also diagnostic.

Healthy individuals infected with Cryptosporidium usually develop mild, self-limited (10-14
days) diarrhea, but those with impaired immunity (eg, AIDS, organ transplant recipients on
immunosuppression therapy) are at risk for severe and protracted symptoms with fluid loss
sometimes exceeding >20 L a day.
