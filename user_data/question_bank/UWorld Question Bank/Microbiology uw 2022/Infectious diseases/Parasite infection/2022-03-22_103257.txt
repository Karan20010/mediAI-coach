Entamoeba histolytica is an amoeba that infects the gastrointestinal tract of humans and is
transmitted via the fecal-oral route when cysts are ingested from contaminated food or water.
Cases are most common in developing regions where sanitation is poor. Most infected
patients have no symptoms, but a minority (~10%) develop clinically significant colitis with
subacute bloody, mucoid diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The diagnosis is confirmed
when cysts and trophozoites are seen on stool studies and/or colonic biopsy demonstrates
flask-shaped ulcers (with trophozoites).

Although most infections stay localized to the colon, a small minority (~1%) disseminate
through the bloodstream to the liver, lungs, and/or brain. The most common extraintestinal
manifestation is a single amebic liver abscess in the right lobe of the liver. Invasive strains
are more likely to have amebic proteases that degrade host extracellular matrix components
and secretory IgA. Most invasive strains also demonstrate contact-dependent cytotoxicity,
which is facilitated by an amebic lectin that binds to host cells.
