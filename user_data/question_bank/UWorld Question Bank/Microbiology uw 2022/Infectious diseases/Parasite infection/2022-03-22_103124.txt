(Choice A) Oral acyclovir is used for genital herpes simplex virus infection, which usually
causes painful vesicular genital lesions on an erythematous base.

(Choice B) Oral doxycycline is first-line treatment for hidradenitis suppurativa, a chronic
follicular occlusive disease that manifests in the intertriginous skin areas (eg, groin, axilla,
inframammary). Manifestations usually include recurrent inflammatory nodules and abscesses
with pain and malodorous discharge.

(Choice C) Oral fluconazole can be used to treat mucocutaneous Candida infections.
Candida balanitis can cause severe pruritus but would be associated with white patches on an
erythematous base.

(Choice D) Topical imiquimod increases the immune-response to anogenital warts due to
human papilloma virus infection. It stimulates interferon-alpha, tumor necrosis factor, and
interleukin-1/6/8. Anogenital warts can have many presentations (eg, flat, dome-shaped,
filiform, pedunculated, verrucous) and may occasionally be pruritic.

(Choice F) Topical corticosteroids can be used to treat inflammatory cutaneous conditions
such as psoriasis and contact dermatitis. Although these conditions can cause erythema and
pruritus, they would not be associated with a translucent louse on examination.
