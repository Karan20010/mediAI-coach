symptoms began 10 days ago with episodic abdominal discomfort and loose stools. The
symptoms have progressively worsened, and he has had 6-8 stools mixed with blood and
mucus over the past 2 days. The patient recently returned from a 2-week trip to Egypt and felt
well while traveling. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg, and
pulse is 86/min. The abdomen is soft with mild tenderness on palpation of lower quadrants.
There is no guarding or rebound tenderness, and bowel sounds are hyperactive. Stool testing
