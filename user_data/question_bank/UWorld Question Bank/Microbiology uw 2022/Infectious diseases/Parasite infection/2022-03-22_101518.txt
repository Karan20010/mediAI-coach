This patient's recent travel, transient pulmonary symptoms, and subsequent gastrointestinal
manifestations are suspicious for a parasitic infection involving the lungs and intestines.
Stool microscopy reveals an oval egg with a thick outer shell and a single interior ovum,
thereby confirming Ascaris lumbricoides (roundworm) infection.

A lumbricoides is a common parasitic infection in Asia, Africa, and South America. Most cases
in the United States arise in travelers to these regions. Transmission occurs when eggs are
ingested via contaminated food or water. Eggs hatch into larvae in the small intestine,
penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate to the alveoli, where they mature. Pulmonary
infection is generally asymptomatic, but a minority of infected individuals develop Loeffler
syndrome, a transient, eosinophilic pneumonitis with pulmonary symptoms (eg, dry cough,
dyspnea, wheezing).

After several days, larvae are coughed out of the alveoli and subsequently swallowed into the
gastrointestinal tract, where they mature into long (25- to 35-cm) adult worms that shed up to
200,000 eggs per day. Most gastrointestinal infections are asymptomatic, but some patients
have abdominal discomfort, nausea/vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis of gastrointestinal
tract infection is made by inspecting the stool for eggs; treatment with antiparasitic drugs (eg,
albendazole) is generally curative.
