This neonate with retinal lesions (chorioretinitis) and hydrocephalus has a placenta
containing inflammatory cells, calcifications, and crescent-shaped organisms. These
findings are consistent with congenital toxoplasmosis, an infection caused by the
intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Nonspecific neonatal findings of jaundice and
hepatosplenomegaly are often present; diffuse intracranial calcifications are the classic
finding on imaging.

Parasitic spread of Toxoplasma begins via infected cats (host), which excrete oocysts that
contaminate soil and water. Humans typically acquire the infection due to either of the
following:

¢ Incidental ingestion of oocysts from cat feces (eg, handling kitty litter, consuming
unwashed produce)

¢ Consumption of undercooked meat from farm animals that ingested oocysts and
developed tissue infection

Ingestion of contaminated meat is the most common method of spread in pregnancy.
Therefore, although maternal infection is often asymptomatic, pregnant women are advised to
avoid raw, cured, and undercooked meat to reduce the risk of infection and transplacental
transmission to the fetus.
