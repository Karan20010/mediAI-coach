This patient from Guatemala with an adult-onset seizure and a cystic brain lesion likely has
neurocysticercosis (NCC), an infection caused by Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) eggs.
Although rare in the United States, T solium is endemic to rural areas of developing nations
(eg, Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, Asia) where sanitation is poor
and pigs roam freely.

T solium causes 2 distinct infections in humans, as follows:

¢ Tapeworm infection occurs when humans ingest T solium larvae in undercooked pork.
The larvae mature into adult worms in the digestive tract and secrete eggs into stool.

¢ Cysticercosis occurs when humans ingest T solium eggs in contaminated food or water.
The eggs hatch into embryos in the gastrointestinal tract, invade the bowel wall, migrate
through the bloodstream, and lodge in tissue (eg, brain, muscle, liver). In tissue, the
embryos form cysticerci, fluid-filled larval cysts with an invaginated scolex (head of
tapeworm with hooklets). Over months or years, the cysts degenerate, leading to
inflammation, edema, and symptoms (eg, seizure).
