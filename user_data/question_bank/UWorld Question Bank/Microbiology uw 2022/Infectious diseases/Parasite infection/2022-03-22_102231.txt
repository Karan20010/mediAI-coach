Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most common complication of Chagas disease. It is
thought to be caused by chronic, low-grade, parasite-mediated myocarditis, which leads to the
progressive destruction of cardiac fibers and subsequent cardiac fibrosis. Common
complications include biventricular heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias (particularly ventricular
arrhythmias), and ventricular aneurysm with intracardiac thrombus (leads to thromboembolic
disease/stroke).
