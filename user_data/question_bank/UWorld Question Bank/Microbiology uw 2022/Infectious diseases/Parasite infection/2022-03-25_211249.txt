Schistosomiasis is a parasitic blood fluke infection endemic to rural areas of sub-Saharan
Africa, Asia, and South America. Transmission occurs when humans bathe in freshwater
ponds, lakes, or rivers contaminated with cercariae from infected snails. Cercariae penetrate
the dermis and travel to the liver, where they evolve into adult worms and subsequently
migrate into the venules in the walls of the intestines, colon, or bladder.

Because adult schistosomes absorb host proteins and display host antigens on their surface,
they are relatively protected from immune recognition and generally do not cause symptoms.
However, adult worms shed eggs into the circulation that travel through host tissues and
induce eosinophilic granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis (as seen in the image
above). This can lead to indolent symptoms in the liver, spleen, bowel wall, and genitourinary
system. One characteristic manifestation of genitourinary schistosomiasis is the development
of hematuria at the end of voiding ("terminal hematuria") due to bladder wall inflammation
and ulcers; urinary calcifications, obstruction, and bladder cancer may eventually develop.
