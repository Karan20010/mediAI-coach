(Choice A) Bats are a major reservoir for the rabies virus.

(Choices B and E) The dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause
of hydatid cysts in humans. Disease can occur following ingestion of foods contaminated with
dog feces. Sheep are an intermediate host in this parasite's life cycle.

(Choice C) Infection with the human tapeworm Diphyllobothrium latum occurs due to the
ingestion of larvae from raw freshwater fish. Disease classically results in vitamin B12
deficiency and megaloblastic anemia.

(Choice D) Human tapeworm infections caused by Taenia solium occur following
consumption of larvae in infected undercooked pork. Cysticercosis is a disease caused by the
larval stage of the organism following ingestion of eggs found in the excrement of T solium
tapeworm carriers.
