Educational objective:

Hookworms are transmitted when human skin comes into contact with soil contaminated with
human feces. The larvae penetrate the skin, travel to the lungs, are coughed up, and then
subsequently swallowed. Adult hookworms live in the small intestine and feed on human
blood. Therefore, chronic iron deficiency anemia (microcytic anemia) is the greatest

complication.
