This patient with an acute febrile illness, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia (indirect
hyperbilirubinemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, low haptoglobin), abnormal liver function
tests, and intraerythrocytic inclusions (ring-shaped and "Maltese cross" forms) has babesiosis,
a tick-borne infection. A definitive diagnosis can be made from a Giemsa-stained blood smear
showing intraerythrocytic parasites. Splenectomy places patients at increased risk for severe
babesiosis, which can manifest as acute respiratory distress syndrome (dyspnea, coarse
crackles, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray).

Babesiosis (caused by Babesia microti) and Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi)
are both transmitted by the /xodes tick and occur in similar geographic regions. Coinfection
is common and could be considered in the appropriate epidemiologic setting (eg, patients who
present with babesiosis in a region endemic for Lyme disease and who do not improve despite
appropriate treatment).
