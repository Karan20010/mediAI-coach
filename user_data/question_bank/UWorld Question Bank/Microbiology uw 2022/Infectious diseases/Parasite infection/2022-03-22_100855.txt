Neurocysticercosis is a helminth infection that occurs after the ingestion of Taenia solium
eggs. It often presents with adult-onset seizure in patients from an endemic area. Imaging
reveals 21 cystic brain lesions. The presence of a scolex, the anterior portion of the worm with
hooks and suckers, is diagnostic.
