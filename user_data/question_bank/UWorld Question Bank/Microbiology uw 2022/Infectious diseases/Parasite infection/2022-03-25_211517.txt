Depending on the size of the cyst, surgery and adjunctive chemotherapy (eg, albendazole) are
the treatment of choice for symptomatic patients. Cyst manipulation (eg, surgery, aspiration)
should be performed with caution, as spilling of cyst contents can cause anaphylactic shock,

which likely occurred in this patient.
