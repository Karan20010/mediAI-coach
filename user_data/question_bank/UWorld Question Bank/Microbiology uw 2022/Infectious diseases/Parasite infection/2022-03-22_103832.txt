organ malignancies.

(Choice B) Cryptococcus neoformans can rarely cause eosinophilic meningitis. However,
cryptococcal infections primarily occur in those with profound immunocompromise (eg, AIDS)
and typically present with subacute manifestations (eg, fever and headache over 1-2 weeks).
This patient who is otherwise healthy and recently traveled to Asia is far more likely to have
Angiostrongylus cantonensis.

(Choice C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis is possible in a patient who travels extensively to
endemic areas. Although tubercular meningitis may occur, it causes lymphocyte-predominant
meningitis; eosinophilic meningitis is not seen.

(Choice D) Herpes simplex virus can cause encephalitis due to infection of the temporal
lobe. Patients usually present with fever, focal neurologic deficit, and/or seizure. Dramatically
elevated erythrocytes (due to cerebral microhemorrhage), not eosinophils, are typically seen
on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In addition, brain imaging generally reveals temporal lobe

abnormalities.

(Choice E) West Nile virus is usually marked by a lymphocyte-predominant meningitis;
profound cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia is uncommon.
