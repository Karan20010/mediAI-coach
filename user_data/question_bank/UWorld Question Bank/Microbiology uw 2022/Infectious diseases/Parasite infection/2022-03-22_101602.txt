Educational objective:

Ascaris lumbricoides is transmitted via contaminated food or water. Eggs hatch into larvae in
the small intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall, and migrate across the lung into the alveoli.
Larvae are subsequently coughed up and swallowed into the gastrointestinal tract, where they
mature to adult worms. Most patients are asymptomatic, but some develop early pulmonary
manifestations (Loeffler syndrome) or later gastrointestinal symptoms.
