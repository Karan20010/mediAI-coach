Educational objective:

Naegleria fowleri is a free-living, motile protozoan that lives in warm water. Exposure can
result in primary amebic encephalitis, which is characterized by acute fever, headache,
confusion, and neck stiffness. The diagnosis is confirmed when motile trophozoites are seen
on cerebrospinal fluid wet mount. Nearly all patients die.
