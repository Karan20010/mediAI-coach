Chagas disease is a vector-borne protozoan illness endemic to most Latin American
countries. Risk is greatest in those with long-term domestic exposure to the Triatomine bug,
which nests in thatched roofing and the cracks of adobe or unfinished brick. Transmission
occurs when the bug feeds on human blood during the night and defecates the underlying
pathogen, Trypanosoma cruzi, into the bite wound.
