Educational objective:

Red blood cells filled with multiple, small rings suggest Plasmodium infection (malaria).
Erythrocytic forms of this parasite may be treated with antimalarials such as chloroquine (in
non-resistant areas), atovaquone-proguanil, and artemisinins. Primaquine is required to kill P
vivax and P ovale liver hypnozoites.
