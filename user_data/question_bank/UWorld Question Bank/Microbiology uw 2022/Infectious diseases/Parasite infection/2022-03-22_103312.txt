Educational objective:

Entamoeba histolytica is an amoeba that causes colitis characterized by trophozoites and
flask-shaped ulcers on biopsy. It can occasionally (~1%) invade the colonic wall and
disseminate through the blood to the liver, brain, or lungs. A single amebic liver abscess is the
most common extraintestinal manifestation.
