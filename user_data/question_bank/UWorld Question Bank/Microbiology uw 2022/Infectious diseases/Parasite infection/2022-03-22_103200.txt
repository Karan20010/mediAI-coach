When examined for ova and parasites (stool smear with iodine staining), this patient's stool
reveals ellipsoidal cysts with smooth, well-defined walls and 2+ nuclei, consistent with Giardia
lamblia. Other classic findings include pear-shaped, flagellated trophozoites. Giardia is the
most common enteric parasite in the United States and Canada. When an individual drinks
contaminated water from an endemic area without first boiling it, Giardia can colonize the
duodenal and jejunal mucosal lining. Hikers and campers are particularly susceptible to
infection.

Giardiasis causes chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and flatulence. Metronidazole is an
accepted treatment for this protozoan flagellate. This drug can also be used to treat
Helicobacter pylori infections, amebiasis, and trichomoniasis.
