close contact with a carrier or infected individual. It is a common cause of community-acquired
bacterial meningitis and usually presents with rapidly progressive headache, myalgia,

Diagnosis is often made with blood culture and/or CSF Gram stain.

(Choice D) Malaria is a mosquito-borne protozoal illness that is endemic to Southeast Asia.
Patients with malaria can develop encephalopathy (cerebral malaria) with confusion,
