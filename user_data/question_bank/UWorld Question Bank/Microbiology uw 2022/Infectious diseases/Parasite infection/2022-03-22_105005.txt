(Choice E) Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidium and is transmitted
primarily by unprotected sexual intercourse. Patients with syphilis infections can occasionally
develop lymphocytic meningitis early in infection. However, syphilis is usually diagnosed with
serology; trophozoites would not be present in the CSF.
