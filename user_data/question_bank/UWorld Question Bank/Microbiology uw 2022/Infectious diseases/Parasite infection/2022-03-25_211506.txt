The tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus is the most common cause of hydatid cysts.
Most cases occur in individuals from endemic regions (eg, eastern Mediterranean, Middle
East, South America, sub-Saharan Africa, former Soviet Union, western China) or those
residing in the southwestern United States with sheep and dog (participate in the tapeworm
life cycle) exposure. Initial infection is generally asymptomatic, with subsequent
manifestations depending on cyst location and size. The liver is often affected (leading to
hepatomegaly or right upper quadrant pain), but other organs such as the lungs or muscles
can be involved. Unilocular lesions are typical of E granulosus, and multilocular lesions are
typical of E multilocularis.

When infection occurs, echinococcal larvae implant within the capillaries, triggering an
inflammatory reaction involving monocytes and eosinophils. Some larvae encyst. Microscopic
examination demonstrates an encapsulated and calcified cyst ("eggshell calcification")
containing fluid and budding cells that will eventually become daughter cysts. The outer wall is
composed of gelatinous sheets surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. Imaging (ultrasound,
CT, MRI) and serology testing can be used for diagnosis.
