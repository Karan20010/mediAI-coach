(Choice A) Artemisinin-based combination therapy is used for chloroquine resistant malaria.
Malaria can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, but patients are usually acutely ill (eg, fever,
chills, myalgia, headache). Giemsa-stained blood smear generally reveals intraerythrocytic
ring-shaped trophozoites, not eggs with a spine.

(Choice B) Bacterial infection of the gastrointestinal tract is common when traveling to
countries with poor sanitation and water control systems. Ciprofloxacin is sometimes used for
treatment. However, most cases are brief in duration, eosinophilia is not generally seen, and
eggs would not be present.

(Choice C) Ganciclovir can treat cytomegalovirus colitis, which frequently causes diarrhea
and abdominal pain. However, most cases arise in patients that are severely
immunocompromised. Furthermore, fever is usually present and biopsy would show
intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions, not eggs.

(Choice D) Metronidazole plus paromomycin is used to treat Entamoeba histolytica, which is
a common cause of dysentery (eg, diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain) in travelers. However, the
presence of several months of symptoms, eosinophilia, and eggs on biopsy make this
diagnosis unlikely.
