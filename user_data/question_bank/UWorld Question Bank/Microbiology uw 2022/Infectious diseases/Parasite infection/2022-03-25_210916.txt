This patient's travel history, chronic intestinal symptoms, eosinophilia, and biopsy findings
suggest schistosomiasis, a parasitic blood fluke infection primarily seen in rural parts of sub-
Saharan Africa and East Asia. Exposure occurs when humans swim or bathe in freshwater
that contains contaminated snails (the intermediate host). Cercariae from the snails
penetrate human skin and migrate to the liver, where they mature into adult worms. Adult
worms then travel through the portal circulation to the mesenteric venules (S mansoni and S
japonicum) or the venous plexus of the bladder (S haematobium).

Adult worms release eggs through host tissue to be excreted in feces or urine. Although most
patients are asymptomatic, eggs can trigger a significant granulomatous inflammatory
response, leading to manifestations in the gastrointestinal tract (eg, diarrhea, weight loss,
anorexia, anemia), bladder (eg, terminal hematuria), or periportal system (eg, portal
hypertension, splenomegaly). Eosinophilia is common early in the disease course as
eosinophils release granules that are toxic to adult worms.

Diagnostic confirmation requires the identification of round/oval eggs with a characteristic
terminal (S. haematobium) or lateral (S. mansoni) spine on stool/urinary testing or tissue
biopsy. Treatment with praziquantel, which alters parasite digestion and calcium transport, is
generally curative.
