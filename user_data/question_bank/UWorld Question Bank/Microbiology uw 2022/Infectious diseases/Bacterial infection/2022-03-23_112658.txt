Manifestations begin with fever, headache, myalgia, and malaise followed 3-5 days later by a
characteristic macular rash that becomes petechial over time. The rash typically begins on
the ankles or wrists and spreads toward the center of the body (centripetally) as well as to the
palms and soles. Thrombocytopenia frequently occurs as platelets are consumed due to
widespread vascular injury. Antibiotic therapy is required to prevent progression and,
potentially, death. First-line therapy is doxycycline, which inhibits protein synthesis by
binding the 30s bacterial ribosomal subunit.
