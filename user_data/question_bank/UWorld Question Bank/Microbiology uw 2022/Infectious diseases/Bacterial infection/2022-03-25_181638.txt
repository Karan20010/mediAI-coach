Fever, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pains, and erythroderma (diffuse macular rash resembling a
sunburn) are manifestations of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS can rapidly progress to
severe hypotension and multisystem dysfunction (eg, elevated creatinine, elevated
transaminases). Desquamation, particularly on the palms and soles, can occur 1-2 weeks
after the onset of illness. TSS has been associated with the use of tampons and nasal
packing.

Staphylococcus aureus strains producing toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST) are
responsible for most cases of TSS. TSST acts as a superantigen that activates large
numbers of helper T cells (compared to a regular antigen, which activates few helper T cells).
Superantigens interact with major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting
cells (eg, macrophages) and with the variable region of the T lymphocyte receptor to cause
a nonspecific, widespread activation of T lymphocytes. Activation of T cells is responsible for
the release of interleukin (IL)-2 from the T cells and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor from
macrophages. These ILs cause capillary leakage, circulatory collapse, hypotension, shock,
fever, skin findings, and multiorgan failure.
