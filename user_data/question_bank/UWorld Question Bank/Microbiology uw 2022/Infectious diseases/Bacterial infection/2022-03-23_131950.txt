(Choice B) Hospital-acquired, drug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant S aureus,
can cause neutropenic fever but do so much less often than endogenous commensal bacteria.

(Choice C) Pathogens spread from infected contacts (eg, influenza) are more likely to cause
severe infection in those with impaired immunity. However, the greatest cause of neutropenic
fever is endogenous bacterial flora.

(Choice D) The reactivation of latent bacterial (eg, tuberculosis) and viral (eg,
cytomegalovirus) pathogens is common in those with sustained impairments to cellular
immunity (eg, AIDS, immunosuppression following transplantation, immunotherapy for
rheumatologic conditions). Neutropenia following chemotherapy is typically transient; the
majority of infections in this setting are due to the invasion of commensal bacteria through
damaged gastrointestinal epithelium. Reactivation of latent viral or bacterial infections can
occur but is far less common.

(Choice E) Vector-borne and zoonotic organisms are not a primary cause of neutropenic
fever in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy. These pathogens are common in
travelers to developing nations.
