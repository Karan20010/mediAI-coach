Clostridium septicum is a spore-forming, exotoxin-producing, gram-positive bacterium that is
a normal commensal of the gastrointestinal tract in humans. Although the organism is largely
nonpathogenic, breakdowns in the gastrointestinal mucosa can lead to invasion with
subsequent hematogenous dissemination to healthy muscle tissue, resulting in
spontaneous gas gangrene (nontraumatic). Manifestations include rapid-onset muscle
pain, fever, hemorrhagic bullae with dusky surrounding skin, and tissue edema/crepitus.
Urgent antibiotics and surgery are required, as the infection is often fatal even with early
treatment.

Most cases of spontaneous gas gangrene are triggered by an underlying colonic
malignancy, which creates a portal of entry for the bacteria. Inflammatory bowel disease and
immunosuppression are also risk factors. Unlike C septicum gas gangrene, C perfringens gas
gangrene is usually associated with preceding trauma.
