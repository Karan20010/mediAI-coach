+ 4 transpeptidase that reduce beta-lactam binding or the production of enzymes (eg,

. - penicillinase) that break down the drug (Choices A and C).

_ 7 (Choice D) Polymyxin binds to lipopolysaccharide, leading to disruption of the bacterial

. 8

- 9 cytoplasmic membrane. It does not interfere with the bacterial cell wall.

(Choice E) Tetracycline binds to the 30S ribosomal subunit and prevents binding of
aminoacyl-transfer RNAs. Resistance stems primarily from an efflux pump or alteration to the
ribosome that allows translation to take place even when tetracycline is present.

Educational objective:

Vancomycin binds to the terminal D-alanine—D-alanine in bacterial pentapeptide peptidoglycan
subunits, which prevents transpeptidase from binding to the pentapeptide, thereby inhibiting
cell wall cross-linking. Resistance stems primarily from substitution of the terminal D-alanine
with D-lactate, which prevents vancomycin binding.
