This patient with an uncertain vaccination history likely died from diphtheria, a clinical illness
caused by toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. The disease is rare in the
developed world due to widespread vaccination with diphtheria toxoid, but outbreaks often
occur in regions where vaccination efforts are insufficient (eg, Southeast Asia). Most cases
are transmitted by aerosolized droplets from asymptomatic carriers or infected patients.
Although the pathogen has little capacity for invasion, it generates a potent exotoxin
(diphtheria toxin) that irreversibly inhibits protein synthesis through ADP-ribosylation of
elongation factor-2, leading to host cell death and necrosis. Local effects of the toxin include
pharyngitis and laryngotracheitis, often with an extensive, coalescing exudate
(pseudomembrane). Absorption of the toxin into the bloodstream results in potentially life-
threatening myocarditis and neuritis.

Diphtheria can be prevented with the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) childhood
vaccination, which generates neutralizing IgG antibodies against the binding component (B
subunit) of the diphtheria exotoxin. The vaccine inhibits toxin-mediated cell damage and also
reduces the competitive advantage of toxigenic strains, thereby reducing toxigenic carriage
rates within the population.
