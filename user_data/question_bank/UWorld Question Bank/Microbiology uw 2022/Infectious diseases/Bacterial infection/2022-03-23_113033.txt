aminoglycosides to interfere with protein translation. Other common resistance mechanisms
are the production of enzymes that inactivate the drug by altering its chemical structure or the
production of an efflux pump that decreases the drug's intracellular concentration.

(Choices B and D) Carbapenems and penicillins function similarly to other beta-lactam
antibiotics by inhibiting a family of enzymes responsible for cell wall construction. Resistance
to both can occur through alteration of the antibiotic binding site on the enzyme; decreased
permeability of the antibiotic into the cell wall; or production of beta-lactamases, which alter the
antibiotic structure by cleaving protein bonds in the antibiotic and inactivating it.

(Choice C) Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used to treat methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus infections. It binds to D-alanine-D-alanine, thereby preventing
peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis. Bacteria have been identified in which a D-alanine is
replaced by a D-lactate, leading to vancomycin resistance.

(Choice E) Resistance to the quinolones occurs by alteration of the genes encoding for DNA
gyrase and topoisomerase IV, development of an efflux pump, or alteration of the membrane
diffusion channels used by the antibiotic.
