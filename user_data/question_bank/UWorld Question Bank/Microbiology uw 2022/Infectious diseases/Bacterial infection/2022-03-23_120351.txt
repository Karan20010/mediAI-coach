MAC organisms are acquired by ingestion or inhalation. They are phagocytosed by
macrophages but initially evade destruction due to microbial virulence factors that prevent
phagolysosome formation. In healthy individuals, the infection is controlled with the cell-
mediated immune response. However, in patients with advanced AIDS, the body is unable to
generate sufficient CD4-mediated cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma) to activate macrophages,
which allows the pathogen to spread through the bloodstream and reticuloendothelial system.

Most patients with disseminated infection have nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss,
diarrhea). Widespread involvement of the reticuloendothelial system often causes anemia,
hepatosplenomegaly, and/or elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. The
diagnosis is usually made with blood cultures, but results may take weeks because
mycobacteria grow slowly. Histologic findings in the bone marrow include foamy macrophages
with intracellular, acid-fast bacilli. Granulomata may be seen.
