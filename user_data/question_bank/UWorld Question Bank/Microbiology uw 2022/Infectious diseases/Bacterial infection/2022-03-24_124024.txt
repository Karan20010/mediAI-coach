Educational objective:

Lysogenic bacteriophages are responsible for converting nonpathogenic Corynebacterium into
toxigenic Corynebacterium. Toxigenic strains elaborate the diphtheria exotoxin, which causes
pseudomembranous pharyngitis and potentially life-threatening systemic effects (eg,
myocarditis, neuritis).
