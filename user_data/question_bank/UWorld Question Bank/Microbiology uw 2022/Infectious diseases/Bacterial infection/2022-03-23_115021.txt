(Choice G) Primary syphilis commonly presents as a characteristically painless single genital
ulcer called a chancre. The diagnosis is established by identification of the organisms on
darkfield microscopy, serologic testing, or syphilis antibody testing. Secondary syphilis is often
characterized by systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, grey mucous patches, raised grey
genital papules (condylomata lata), and a diffuse rash involving the palms and soles.

(Choice H) Penile squamous cell cancer can present as lumps or ulcers, sometimes with
adenopathy. However, the lesions are typically painless, and average age at presentation is
50.
