(Choice A) Caspofungin is an antifungal agent that blocks synthesis of the glucan component
of the fungal cell wall. It is active against Candida and Aspergillus. Caspofungin does not bind
ergosterol.

(Choice B) Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant used in transplant recipients to prevent
rejection. It decreases the synthesis of IL-2, thereby inhibiting T cell proliferation.

(Choice C) Flucytosine is used in combination with amphotericin B primarily for the treatment
of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with HIV. It is a nucleotide analog that competitively
inhibits RNA synthesis in fungal cells.

(Choice D) Griseofulvin interacts with fungal cell microtubules, inhibiting mitosis. It
accumulates in keratin-containing tissues and is used to treat dermatophyte infections (eg,
Microsporum, Epidermophyton, Trichophyton).
