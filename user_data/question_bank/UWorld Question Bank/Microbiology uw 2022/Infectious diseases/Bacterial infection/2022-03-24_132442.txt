Leptospirosis is a widespread, zoonotic infection caused by several species of Leptospira, a
thin, highly coiled, motile spirochete that infects wild (eg, rodents) and domestic (eg, dogs,
cattle) animals. Infected animals harbor the organism in the proximal renal tubule and excrete
itin urine. Transmission to humans primarily occurs during outdoor recreational (eg, kayaking,
freshwater swimming) or occupational activities that exposes them to water contaminated
with animal urine.

Most cases of leptospirosis are mild or subclinical. However, some patients develop a flu-like
illness (eg, fever, rigors, myalgia, headache), lymphadenopathy, or more severe end-organ
disease such as renal failure or hepatic failure (eg, jaundice, hepatomegaly). Conjunctival
suffusion, redness of the conjunctiva that resembles conjunctivitis but is noninflammatory, is
an important diagnostic clue. Because spirochetes do not grow well on traditional culture
media, initial testing (eg, influenza antigen, blood culture) is often negative. However,
specialized culture media can often identify the corkscrew-shaped organism. Most cases
are self-limited and do not require treatment.
