4 gas transfer. They usually result in significant dyspnea and/or respiratory collapse, and are

. typically seen with newborn and acute respiratory distress syndromes.

20 (Choice C) Endotoxins (eg, lipopolysaccharide) are found in the outer membrane of gram-

23 released into the circulation. Gram-positive organisms do not have endotoxins but some

* release exotoxins.

. (Choice D) Intracellular organisms such as Neisseria, Listeria, and Mycobacterium
