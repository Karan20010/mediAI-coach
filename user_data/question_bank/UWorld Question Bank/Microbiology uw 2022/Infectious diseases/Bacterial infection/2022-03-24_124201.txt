Educational objective:

Bacillus anthracis is a large, sporulating, gram-positive rod that is encased in an
antiphagocytic polypeptide capsule composed of D-glutamic acid. Inhalation of B anthracis
spores can cause pulmonary anthrax, which is usually characterized by nonspecific symptoms

followed by hemorrhagic mediastinitis, shock, and death.
