(Choice A) For isoniazid monotherapy to result in the selective survival of intracellular bacilli
would suggest that isoniazid is unable to penetrate into (or is otherwise degraded by)
macrophages that house M. tuberculosis. However, this is not the case. Isoniazid can reach
therapeutic levels within macrophages, areas of caseous necrosis, and cerebrospinal fluid.

(Choice B) Decreased transport protein expression at the cell surface would interfere with the
effectiveness of drugs that require protein-mediated transport into the bacterial cell to reach
the intended target (eg, fluoroquinolones, macrolides, aminoglycosides).

(Choice C) $-lactamase induction within bacterial cells would not result from isoniazid
exposure because isoniazid is not a beta-lactam antibiotic.

(Choice D) Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body occurs when a small inoculum is
recognized and quickly destroyed by the cell-mediated immune system. This happens in the
majority of exposures. By the time tuberculosis has progressed to active, symptomatic
disease, large caseous and liquefactive necrotic granulomas have usually formed and a
lengthy treatment period with appropriate multidrug therapy is required to eradicate the
organism. Antibiotic therapy for tuberculosis lasts a minimum of six months.
