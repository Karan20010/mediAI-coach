(Choice B) Dental extraction is associated with endocarditis caused by viridans group
streptococci (VGS). In most cases, VGS cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in already
abnormal heart valves (eg, congenital valvular abnormalities, valves damaged by rheumatic
fever). VGS do not grow on hypertonic saline. In addition, almost all VGS species do not
grow on bile (VGS are also considered bile-insoluble as they exhibit no cell lysis in the
presence of bile, in contrast to the bile-soluble S pneumoniae).

(Choice C) Removal of a nasal polyp can cause transient bacteremia. Organisms that
colonize the nose include Corynebacterium species, Haemophilus species, staphylococci,
streptococci, and Neisseria species. Of these, staphylococci and streptococci may cause
endocarditis, but the organism described displays characteristics of Enterococcus.

(Choice D) Sinus infections are usually caused by S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or
Moraxella catarrhalis. S pneumoniae would be a very rare cause of endocarditis and is usually
identified by being bile-soluble and optochin-sensitive.

(Choice E) Skin biopsy is a benign procedure that would be unlikely to cause endocarditis.
Skin is colonized with many bacteria, including Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species,
Corynebacterium species, and Bacillus species.
