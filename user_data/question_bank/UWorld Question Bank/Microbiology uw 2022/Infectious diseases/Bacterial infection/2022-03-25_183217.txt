Educational objective:

Clostridium tetani produces the neurotoxin tetanospasmin, which blocks inhibitory
neurotransmission in the spinal cord and leads to tonic muscular contraction. Tetanus is
prevented by immunization with an inactivated toxoid that triggers the production of antitoxin
antibodies (active immunity).
