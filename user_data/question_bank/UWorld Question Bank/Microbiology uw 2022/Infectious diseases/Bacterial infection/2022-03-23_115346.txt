Francisella tularensis is a small, poorly staining coccobacillus that can persist in
environmental reservoirs (eg, mud, water, animal carcasses) for weeks or months.
Transmission to humans occurs primarily due to direct contact with an infected wild animal
(eg, hares, rabbits, squirrels) during hunting/skinning or due to a bite by a tick or mosquito
that recently fed on an infected wild animal.

F tularensis possesses several strong virulence factors (eg, capsule, lipopolysaccharide, pili),
and transmission of as few as 10 microbes can trigger infection. The pathogen multiplies at
the site of inoculation, travels to draining lymph nodes, and then spreads via the
lymphohematogenous route.

The symptoms of tularemia are dependent on the route of transmission. Ulceroglandular
disease, the most common presentation, typically occurs after cutaneous inoculation.
Patients develop a single papuloulcerative lesion with surrounding erythema and a central
eschar at the site of transmission. Tender regional lymphadenopathy occurs simultaneously
or within a few days and may become suppurative. Most patients have fever. Sometimes,
the cutaneous lesion is not present; other forms of tularemia can also occur, including
pneumonia.
