(Choice A) Bronchiolitis is a lower respiratory infection that is almost always viral in etiology.
Respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza are commonly implicated,
but not H influenzae.

(Choices B, D, and E) Most causes of bacterial conjunctivitis, acute otitis media, and sinusitis
in childhood are due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, nontypeable H influenzae, and Moraxella
catarrhalis. The Hib vaccine (which has no effect on nontypeable H influenzae) will not protect
a child from these infections.
