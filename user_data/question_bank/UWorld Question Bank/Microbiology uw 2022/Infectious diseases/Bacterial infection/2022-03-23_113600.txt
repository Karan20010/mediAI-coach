This patient with dysuria and urinary leukocyte esterase and nitrites likely has a urinary tract
infection (UTI), which is most commonly caused by fecal flora (eg, Escherichia coli). Females
are at increased risk because the urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Bacterial growth of
a single pathogenic organism on urine culture is typically diagnostic. However, urine dipstick
is usually performed initially because it rapidly assesses for UTI pending culture results.

The most specific dipstick finding for bacterial UTI is nitrites. Pathophysiology involves
production of nitrate reductase by certain bacteria (eg, E coli, Klebsiella, Proteus); this
bacterial enzyme reduces normal urinary nitrate (NO-) to nitrite (NO~). The level of nitrites

correlates with the incubation time of bacteria in the bladder.

In patients with UTI caused by nitrate reductaseâ€”producing bacteria, dipstick analysis
performed on the first voided urine in the morning is usually positive due to prolonged
overnight bacterial incubation (>4 hr), allowing nitrites to accumulate. In contrast, specimens
obtained during the day may show false negative results, as in this patient's initial sample,
because of the shorter duration of urine in the bladder and urinary frequency.
