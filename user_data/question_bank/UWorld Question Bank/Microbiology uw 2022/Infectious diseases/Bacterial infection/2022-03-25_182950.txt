This patient's rapidly worsening fever, vomiting, altered mental status, and nuchal rigidity are
consistent with meningococcal meningitis due to infection with Neisseria meningitidis.
Meningococcal infection usually occurs in children and young adults and can present acutely
with rapid progression (within hours) to meningococcemia and septic shock. These patients
frequently have thrombocytopenia and a petechial rash and are at risk for development of
disseminated intravascular coagulation.

A serious complication of meningococcemia is bilateral hemorrhagic infarction of the
adrenal glands, resulting in acute adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome).
Manifestations include hypoglycemia due to cortisol deficiency as well as hyponatremia and
hyperkalemia due to aldosterone deficiency. Loss of cortisol and aldosterone also contributes
to worsening shock and can result in rapid deterioration and death despite aggressive
intervention.
