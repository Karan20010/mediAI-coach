Educational objective:

The Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine induces anticapsular antibodies that facilitate
complement-mediated phagocytosis of the bacterium. The vaccination series has drastically
reduced the incidence of invasive disease caused by Hib, such as meningitis, bacteremia,
pneumonia, and epiglottitis.
