Neonatal tetanus (tetanus neonatorum) is a major cause of infant mortality in developing
countries but is rare in the United States. Neonatal tetanus results from the introduction of
Clostridium tetani spores to the infant, generally from unhygienic deliveries or cord care.
Symptoms typically begin 5-7 days after birth and can progress more rapidly than in adults.
Infected infants become irritable and have difficulty feeding and suckling due to tonic spasm
of the masticatory muscles (trismus). As the disease progresses, spasms and hypertonicity
become more generalized. Mortality approaches 100% without treatment.

Prevention of neonatal tetanus focuses on vaccinating women who are pregnant or may
become pregnant with inactivated tetanus toxin (tetanus toxoid). Appropriately vaccinated
women provide transplacental IgG to the fetus, which decreases the incidence of neonatal
tetanus by approximately 95%.
