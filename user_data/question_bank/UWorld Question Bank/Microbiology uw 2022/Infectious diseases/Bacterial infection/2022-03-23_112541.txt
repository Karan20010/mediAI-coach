Central venous catheters (CVCs) are commonly used for hemodynamic monitoring and
administration of fluids and medications in critically ill patients. Infection originating from the
patient's skin flora or bacteria on the hands of health care workers is one of the major
complications of CVCs. Gram-positive cocci, primarily coagulase-negative staphylococci
and Staphylococcus aureus, account for the majority of these infections.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend the following steps to reduce
CVC infections:

Hand hygiene with an alcohol sanitizer or soap and water prior to donning sterile gloves

Maximal barrier precautions during insertion (surgical mask, sterile gloves, long-sleeved
surgical gown, and a large sterile sheet drape)

Preparation of the insertion site with chlorhexidine antiseptic

Use of subclavian or internal jugular insertion sites (femoral vein has a higher risk of
infection) (Choice C)
Prompt removal of the catheter when it is no longer needed
