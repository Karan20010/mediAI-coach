(Choices A and F) Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis and is a starting substrate for the
synthesis of glucose, lactate, fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleic acids. Bacteria use
pyruvate in the metabolism of sugars for energy in the form of ATP.

(Choice B) Catalase is an enzyme present in staphylococci; the presence or absence of this
enzyme is used to differentiate staphylococci from streptococci.

(Choice C) Iron is an essential growth factor for many bacteria, and it is provided in all blood
agars from the iron within erythrocytes.

(Choice D) The use of lactose fermentation as a source of energy is best known in
Escherichia coli with the well studied /ac operon, an inducible and repressible genetic
sequence coding for the enzymes necessary for lactose fermentation in the absence of
glucose. Itis activated by a sensed glucose deficit and repressed when glucose is available
again.
