(Choice A) Bats can transmit rabies to humans via a bite wound. Manifestations typically
begin with flulike symptoms and progress to fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, coma,
and death. Rabies is a cylindrical, enveloped RNA virus; it is not a motile, corkscrew-shaped
organism.

(Choice B) Yersinia, a bacteria transmitted by animal (eg, rodent) fleas, can cause bubonic
plague, which typically presents with sudden-onset, flulike symptoms followed by intense pain
and regional lymphadenopathy (eg, inguinal). Yersinia grows well on traditional culture media;
it appears on Gram stain as a gram-negative coccobacillus.

(Choice D) Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tickborne illness caused by the small, gram-
negative bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii. Although initial symptoms are often flulike and may
include conjunctivitis, most individuals develop an erythematous rash that begins on the wrists
and ankles, spreads to the center of the body, and includes the palms and soles. The
organism is not corkscrew-shaped.

(Choice E) Tularemia is caused by the gram-negative bacterium Francisella tularensis, which
frequently infects rabbits. Manifestations typically include flulike symptoms followed by
lymphadenopathy and a papulo-ulcerative eschar at the site of inoculation.
