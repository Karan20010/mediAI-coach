(Choice A) Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative rod that exhibits bipolar staining (ends of
bacilli stain more than the middle). This organism causes a rapidly progressive soft tissue
infection following an animal (usually a cat) bite. Although Pasteurella infection may cause
draining cutaneous sinus tracts, infections are acute and not associated with tooth extraction
or sulfur granules.

(Choice B) Staphylococcus aureus is the leading cause of acute suppurative parotitis, which
is associated with firm, erythematous swelling in the area of the mandibular angle. However, S
aureus soft tissue abscesses progress rapidly and are painful and tender.

(Choice C) Sporothrix schenckii is a conidia-forming, dimorphic fungus that causes cutaneous
sporotrichosis when contaminated soil is inoculated into skin or soft tissue. Manifestations
include an ulcerating papule at the site of inoculation with proximal spread along the
lymphatics leading to additional lesions.

(Choice E) Pseudomonas is an oxidase-positive, gram-negative bacillus that can produce a
green pigment. Cutaneous Pseudomonas infections are most common after hot tub use and
are usually associated with acute folliculitis (tender, pruritic papules or nodules).
