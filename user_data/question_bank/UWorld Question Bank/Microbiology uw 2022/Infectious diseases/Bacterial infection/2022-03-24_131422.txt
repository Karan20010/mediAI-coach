have prosthetic heart valves, or have indwelling lines are at increased risk of infection.

(Choice B) Culture-negative endocarditis - due to Bartonella, Coxiella, Mycoplasma,
Histoplasma, Chlamydia, or the HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus,
Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella), among others - would be much less likely than S

(Choices C, D, E, and H) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae typically
cause pneumonia; Klebsiella can also lead to urinary tract infections. Nocardiosis typically

immunocompromised patients. Peptostreptococcus causes anaerobic infections (dental,
cutaneous, intraabdominal).

(Choice G) Streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly S bovis) is a part of the normal flora of the
colon, and bacteremia or endocarditis caused by S bovis is associated with colon cancer
