This patient with rapidly progressive systemic symptoms, generalized lymphadenopathy, and
an enlarged, painful lymph node likely has bubonic plague, an infection caused by the gram-
negative bacillus/coccobacillus Yersinia pestis. This highly virulent pathogen is endemic to
areas of North and South America, Asia, Africa, and Russia. It is primarily transmitted by
rodent fleas.

Manifestations begin with rapidly progressive fever, chills, weakness, and headache. Painful
regional lymphadenopathy develops concurrently or within a few days; lymph nodes swell,
develop overlying erythema, and often drain purulent fluid (buboes). When left untreated,
plague progresses to sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); the disease is
sometimes called "black death" due to tissue necrosis from DIC.

The most common first-line treatment for plague is an aminoglycoside. This class of
antibiotic prevents bacterial protein synthesis by binding with high affinity to the 30S
ribosomal subunit. Aminoglycosides have particular potency against the Enterobacteriaceae
family, Francisella tularensis, and Y pestis.
