The bacterial cell wall is composed of cross-linked peptidoglycan subunits on a backbone of
N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). Because cell wall disruption
results in bacterial lysis, many antibiotics target cell wall synthesis, including the following:

¢ Fosfomycin blocks development of the NAM-NAG polymer backbone by inhibiting the
enzyme MurA. Resistance stems primarily from efflux pumps or alterations to MurA that
prevent fosfomycin binding (Choice B).

¢ Vancomycin inhibits transpeptidase from cross linking a growing peptidoglycan chain by
binding to the D-alanine—D-alanine terminus of pentapeptide peptidoglycan subunits.
Resistance to vancomycin stems primarily from replacement of the terminal D-alanine—
D-alanine with D-alanine—D-lactate, which reduces vancomycin binding >1000-fold.

¢ Penicillin and cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) are beta-lactam antibiotics that bind to
and directly inhibit transpeptidase. Resistance stems primarily from alterations to
transpeptidase that reduce beta-lactam binding or the production of enzymes (eg,
penicillinase) that break down the drug (Choices A and C).
