(Choice B) Eosinophils are a component of the innate immune system and are tasked
primarily with the eradication of parasitic infections (eg, helminths). Eosinophils play a minor
role in the phagocytosis and destruction of intracellular bacteria.

(Choice C) The humoral immune system secretes immunoglobulins and is largely tasked with
eliminating extracellular infections such as Streptococci and Staphylococci. This system is not
able to effectively target intracellular bacteria as immunoglobulins cannot access the
intracellular space.

(Choice D) Mast cells contribute to defense against parasites and play an important role in
allergic responses, particularly immediate hypersensitivity reactions; they do not confer
immunity to intracellular pathogens.

(Choice E) The complement system is part of the innate immune system and aids in the
opsonization and destruction of bacteria. The terminal complement components (eg, C5b-C9)
create a membrane attack complex to lyse bacteria and are particularly important against
Neisseria infections.
