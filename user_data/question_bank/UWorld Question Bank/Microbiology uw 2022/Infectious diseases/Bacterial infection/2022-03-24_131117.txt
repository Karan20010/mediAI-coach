Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a progressive, fatal illness characterized by the development of thick,
viscous, clogging secretions in a multitude of organs. Young adults with CF typically have
several manifestations of the disorder, including pancreatic insufficiency (eg, diarrhea), chronic
sinusitis, nasal polyps, and chronic bronchitis (eg, long-standing productive cough,
hyperinflated lungs, barrel chest). However, persistent lower respiratory tract infection is
the major source of morbidity and death.

Early in the course of the disease, thick airway secretions obstruct mucociliary clearance and
lead to the colonization of the lower respiratory tract with pathogenic bacteria. Although
Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus are seen in children with CF,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the major pathogen in adults. This organism forms a biofilm
and switches to a mucoid phenotype to prevent its full elimination (even with antibiotics).
Neutrophils respond by releasing elastase, myeloperoxidase, and reactive oxygen species, but
these compounds are insufficient to clear the infection and progressively destroy the walls of
the airway, leading to bronchiectasis and respiratory decline.
