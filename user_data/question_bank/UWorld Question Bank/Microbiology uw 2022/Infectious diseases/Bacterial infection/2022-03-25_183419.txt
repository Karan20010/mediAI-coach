This patient's presentation suggests parotitis, an acute viral or bacterial infection of the
parotid gland. Acute bacterial suppurative parotitis can be due to Staphylococcus aureus
(most common) or mixed oral aerobes/anaerobes. Risk factors include dehydration,
intubation (elderly postoperative patients), medications that decrease salivary flow (eg,
anticholinergics), salivary flow obstruction (eg, salivary calculi, oral cavitary neoplasm), or
recent intense teeth cleaning.

Suppurative parotitis usually presents with acute onset of firm and erythematous
pre/postauricular swelling that extends to the mandible. Patients can also develop trismus,
dysphagia, and systemic findings (eg, fever, chills). The diagnosis can be confirmed by
imaging (eg, ultrasound, CT) showing parotid duct inflammation, obstruction by a stone, or
sometimes abscess. As the parotid gland secretes amylase, suppurative parotitis can present
with elevated serum amylase. However, affected patients have normal serum lipase levels.
without clinical evidence of pancreatitis (Choice D).
