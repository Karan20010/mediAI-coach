not kill the spores), gown for any patient contact, and nonsterile gloves that should be
changed after contact with contaminated secretions. Gloves alone would not be sufficient
(Choice D). In addition, a dedicated stethoscope and blood pressure cuff should be left in the

patient's room.

(Choice A) Certain pathogens are transmitted by droplets (>5 microns) that remain
suspended in air for limited periods only (eg, Neisseria meningitides, influenza, Bordetella
pertussis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus). In such cases, healthcare
workers need to wear a simple facemask when within 6-10 feet of affected patients (droplet
precautions). Gloves and gowns are not required.

(Choice B) Airborne precautions include an isolated room with negative pressure ventilation
and a respirator mask with filtering capacity (eg, N95 mask) to avoid potential exposure to
aerosolized particles (<5 microns) that can remain suspended in air for extended periods.
Gloves and gowns are not needed. Airborne precautions are required for certain bacteria (eg,
tuberculosis) and viruses (eg, varicella), but not for C difficile.

(Choices E and F) Sterile gloves generally are used for minor procedures or surgeries but
are not required in patients with contact precautions.
