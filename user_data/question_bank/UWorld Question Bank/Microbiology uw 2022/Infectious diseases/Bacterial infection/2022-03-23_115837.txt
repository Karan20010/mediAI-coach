(Choice A) Gram-stain cannot be used to definitively determine if GAS is present because
other oropharyngeal organisms (eg, viridans streptococci) also appear as gram-positive cocci
in chains.

(Choice B) Antibodies against M protein, a virulence factor that coats the surface of GAS,
provide protective immunity against future infections with a particular GAS strain. However,
antibody titers take several weeks to elevate after acute infection; therefore, antibody testing is
not used to diagnose acute pharyngitis.

(Choice C) Elevated antibody titers against streptolysin O indicate recent GAS infection and
can aid the diagnosis of GAS complications (eg, rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis).
However, antibodies against streptolysin take several weeks to form; therefore, they are not
used to diagnose acute pharyngitis.
