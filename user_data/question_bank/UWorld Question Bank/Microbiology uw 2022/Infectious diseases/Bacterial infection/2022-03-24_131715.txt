This patient has diarrhea with positive fecal leukocytes and occult blood, findings
consistent with inflammatory diarrhea. Inflammatory diarrhea is most often caused by
bacteria that directly invade intestinal epithelial cells and/or produce a cytotoxin, resulting in an
inflammatory response. Of the given choices, Campylobacter jejuni is the only bacterium
associated with inflammatory diarrhea.

Campylobacter jejuni resides in the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals and is
transmitted to humans primarily via ingestion of contaminated food, particularly undercooked
poultry. However, direct contact with domesticated animals (eg, dogs) is another important
source of transmission; puppies from crowded environments (eg, kennels) are especially likely
to harbor the bacterium. Following ingestion, Campylobacter colonizes the intestinal mucosa,
enters enterocytes within endocytic vacuoles, and causes cytotoxic injury.

Patients typically develop fever, crampy abdominal pain, and diarrhea that may be bloody.
Stool culture is diagnostic, and symptoms usually self-resolve within a week. However, in a
minority of cases, the host response to Campylobacter infection generates cross-reacting
antibodies to peripheral nerve myelin gangliosides, leading to Guillain-Barr√© syndrome.
