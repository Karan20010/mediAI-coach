(Choice A) Bartonella henselae is associated with cat-scratch disease, which can develop
following inoculation from an infected cat and presents with lymphadenopathy that is often self-
limiting. It is not associated with dog bites.

(Choices B and Il) Campylobacter jejuni typically causes gastrointestinal (diarrheal) illness,
and Proteus mirabilis is a common cause of urinary tract infection.

(Choices C and E) Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobe that can cause necrotizing SSTI,
which occurs most commonly after a traumatic wound and leads to myonecrosis and gas
gangrene. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae is a gram-positive rod (not a gram-negative
coccobacillus) that causes erysipeloid.

(Choices D and G) Coxiella burnetii can cause Q fever, a mild form of pneumonia.
Fusobacterium is part of the anaerobic oral flora potentially causing aspiration pneumonia or
pharyngitis (Lemierre disease).

(Choice F) Francisella tularensis causes tularemia, a zoonotic infection that can occur
following contact with lagomorphs and rodents (eg, rabbits, beavers, squirrels). The
presentation is variable (eg, severe febrile pulmonary infection, ulcerative disease at
inoculation site).
