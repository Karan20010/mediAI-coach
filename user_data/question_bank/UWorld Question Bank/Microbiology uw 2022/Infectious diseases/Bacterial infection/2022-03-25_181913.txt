(Choice A) The fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin) are emerging as new components of the
multi-drug regimen used to treat tuberculosis. They inhibit DNA gyrase, leading to fractures in
the bacterial chromosome and an inability to code for proteins necessary for survival.
Fluoroquinolones would not have an immediate effect on the acid-fastness of mycobacteria.

10 (Choice C) Rifampin is an essential component of the multi-drug regimen used to treat active
tuberculosis. Rifampin halts bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting bacterial DNA-dependent
3 RNA polymerase, thereby preventing DNA transcription into mRNA. Rifampin would inhibit
mycobacterial growth in an in vitro culture, but it would not cause the mycobacteria to lose

16 their acid-fastness.

18 (Choice D) Streptomycin is an aminoglycoside that inhibits the bacterial 30S (small)
ribosomal subunit, thereby halting protein synthesis. Mycobacterial cell growth is restricted
21 and eventually cell death results. However, the acid-fastness of the organism is not affected.
Streptomycin is also indicated in the treatment of plague (caused by Yersinia pestis) and
tularemia (caused by Francisella tularensis).

(Choice E) Vancomycin binds to D-alanyl-D-alanine residues, inhibiting polymerization and
cross-linking of the glycopeptides forming the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria (not

mycobacteria).
