This patient has a urinary tract infection caused by an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
(ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli. ESBL enzymes can inactivate extended-spectrum
penicillins and cephalosporins (including third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) and
monobactams (aztreonam). Genes encoding these enzymes are often located on plasmids
and therefore can be transferred between organisms and between different species through
conjugation. Some have been incorporated into bacterial chromosomes. Carbapenems (eg,
imipenem) are the treatment of choice for ESBL-producing organisms (although unfortunately,
organisms with carbapenem resistance have emerged).
