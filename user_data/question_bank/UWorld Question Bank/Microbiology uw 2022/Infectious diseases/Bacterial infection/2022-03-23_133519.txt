Educational objective:

Clostridium difficile requires additional contact precautions, including handwashing with soap

and water, a gown for any patient contact, and nonsterile gloves that should be changed after
contact with contaminated secretions. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers do not kill the bacterial

spores.
