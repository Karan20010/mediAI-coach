This patient with HIV has fever, headache, and central nervous system (eg, spinal fluid) culture
growing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, consistent with M tuberculosis meningitis. Initial
management is best accomplished through combination therapy with isoniazid (INH), rifampin,
pyrazinamide, and either an injectable aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone.

Streptomycin is one of the older drugs in the aminoglycoside family; therefore, bacterial
resistance to this antibiotic is widespread, resulting in its current usage being limited mainly to
the treatment of tuberculosis, plague, and tularemia. Like other aminoglycosides, streptomycin
can be administered only parenterally. It works by interfering with the 16s rRNA of the
bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit, thereby preventing bacterial protein synthesis. Mutations of
the genes that encode ribosomal proteins are responsible for aminoglycoside resistance
because they lead to modifications in the ribosomal binding sites for these drugs. Other
resistance mechanisms to aminoglycosides include aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (eg,
transferases) and mutated porins.
