This patient with a genital ulcer, inguinal lymphadenopathy, and positive
nontreponemal/treponemal testing was treated for primary syphilis with intramuscular
benzathine penicillin G. She then developed an acute febrile syndrome (fever, chills,
myalgia, headache) a few hours later, raising strong suspicion for the Jarisch-Herxheimer
reaction. This systemic inflammatory response occurs within hours of antibiotic initiation for
spirochetal infections (eg, syphilis, Lyme disease, leptospirosis). The rapid lysis of
spirochetes spills bacterial lipoproteins into the bloodstream and triggers a strong innate
immunologic response. Most cases are self-limited and do not require intervention.
