This young patient who engages in high-risk sexual activity developed dysuria, frequency, and
urethral discharge 3 months ago, indicating infectious urethritis. Gram stain at that time
showed intracellular gram-negative diplococci, which is diagnostic for Neisseria
gonorrhoeae infection. Because coinfection with N gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis
is common, and because Chlamydia cannot be seen on Gram stain due to lack of
peptidoglycan in the cell wall, the patient was treated empirically for both infections with
ceftriaxone and doxycycline.

Although treatment resolved the symptoms completely, the patient developed recurrent
manifestations after additional unprotected sexual encounters, raising suspicion for NV
gonorrhoeae reinfection. Gonorrhea infection generates IgA and IgG antibodies against the
bacteria; however, these antibodies provide limited or no protective immunity against future
infections due to an extremely high rate of antigenic variation in bacterial surface molecules
(eg, porins, Opa proteins, lipooligosaccharide).
