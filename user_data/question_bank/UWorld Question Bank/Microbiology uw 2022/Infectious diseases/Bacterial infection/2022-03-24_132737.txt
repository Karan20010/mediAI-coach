Streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive, lancet-shaped organism that grows in pairs
(diplococci). It colonizes the nasopharynx and is a leading cause of community-acquired
pneumonia, bacterial meningitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and sepsis.

The major virulence factor of S pneumoniae is a thick polysaccharide capsule, which
impedes phagocytosis and complement binding. Antibodies against the capsule form during
infection and are protective against future infections with that strain. However, over 90
capsular serotypes have been identified. Therefore, previous infection is rarely protective
against future infection. Other S pneumoniae virulence factors include IgA protease
(inactivates secretory IgA), adhesins (necessary for adhesion to epithelial cells), and
pneumolysin (a cytotoxin that causes pores in cell membranes and cell lysis).

Patients with HIV are at higher risk than the general population for S pneumoniae infection
because HIV impairs opsonizing antibody production, phagocyte recruitment, and cytokine
signaling, which are crucial for the control of encapsulated pathogens. Most patients with HIV
should receive the pneumococcal vaccine, which contains polysaccharide antigens from the
most common strains.
