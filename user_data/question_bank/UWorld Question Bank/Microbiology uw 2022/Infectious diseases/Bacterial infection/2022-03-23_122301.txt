(Choice B) Salmonella appears as a gram-negative oxidase-negative rod. Patients with
sickle cell disease are at increased risk of septic arthritis due to salmonella. However,
salmonella is an uncommon cause of septic arthritis in patients who do not have sickle cell
disease.

(Choice C) Viridans streptococci, a gram-positive alpha-hemolytic cocci in chains, is a
common cause of infective endocarditis and can lead to septic arthritis (due to septic emboli).
Patients with infective endocarditis can have flu-like symptoms and skin findings (eg, Osler
nodes, Janeway lesions). However, vesiculopustular lesions on the arms are much more
characteristic of DGI.

(Choice D) Staphylococcus aureus, a catalase-positive gram-positive cocci in clusters, is the
most common cause of septic arthritis. However, most cases in young adults are linked to
injection drug use. In addition, the presence of vesiculopustular lesions and oligoarticular
arthralgias make gonococcal arthritis more likely.

(Choices E and F) Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystals that appear as needle-
shaped negatively birefringent crystals. Pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate
dihydrate crystals that appear as rhomboid-shaped positively birefringent crystals. Both gout
and pseudogout cause inflammatory arthritis (eg, redness, warmth, pain, disability) with
