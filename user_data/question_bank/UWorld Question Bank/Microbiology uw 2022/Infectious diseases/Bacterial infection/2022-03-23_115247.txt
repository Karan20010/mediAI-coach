Vibrio vulnificus is a curved, gram-negative, free-living bacterium that grows in marine
environments. Transmission primarily occurs due to the consumption of raw seafood (eg,
oysters) or wound contamination. Manifestations are often mild, but individuals with liver
disease or iron overload are at very high risk of severe, fulminant infection (eg, sepsis,
necrotizing fascitis).
