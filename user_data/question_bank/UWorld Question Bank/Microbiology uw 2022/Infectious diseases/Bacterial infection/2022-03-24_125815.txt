Typhoid fever is caused by Sa/monella Typhi or Paratyphi and presents with escalating fever,
followed by abdominal pain, formation of rose spots on the chest/abdomen, and hemorrhagic
enteritis with possible bowel perforation. Humans are the only reservoir; transmission is fecal-
oral and primarily occurs due to ingestion of food or water contaminated with feces.
