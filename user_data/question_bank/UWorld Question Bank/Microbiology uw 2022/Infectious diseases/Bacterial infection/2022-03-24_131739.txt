(Choices A and E) Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus cause enterotoxin-mediated

food-borne illness. Ingestion of preformed toxin leads to rapid-onset vomiting and abdominal

pain; mild diarrhea (noninflammatory) can occur. S aureus is linked to precooked foods, dairy
products, and mayonnaise-based salads; B cereus is associated with starch-based foods (eg,
reheated rice).

(Choice C) Giardia lamblia is usually transmitted by contaminated water; food-borne or
person-to-person spread may occur. Symptoms include foul-smelling, watery diarrhea that is
noninflammatory. In addition, stool ova and parasite testing often reveals Giardia trophozoites
or cysts.

(Choice D) Norovirus, the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis, is usually transmitted
by fecally contaminated food or water. In contrast to this patient, those with norovirus typically
develop a vomiting-predominant illness with abdominal pain and noninflammatory diarrhea.
