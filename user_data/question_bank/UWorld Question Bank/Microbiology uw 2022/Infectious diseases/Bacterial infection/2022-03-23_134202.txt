antigen in its cell wall, and hydrolyzes hippurate.

(Choice A) Escherichia coli, a gram-negative rod, is a common cause of early neonatal
sepsis. Although E coli generates beta-hemolysins, it does not produce CAMP factor;
therefore, enhancement of S aureus hemolysis does not occur.

(Choice B) Enterococcus faecalis, a gram-positive cocci, is a common cause of sepsis in
preterm neonates but is rare in those born at term. In addition, it does not hemolyze red blood
cells (gamma hemolytic) or generate camp factor.

(Choice C) Staphylococcus epidermidis, a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters, is a
common skin commensal that does not cause hemolysis when plated on blood agar.

(Choice E) Streptococcus pneumoniae, a lancet-shaped, gram-positive bacterium, is alpha-
hemolytic (partial, green hemolysis) in aerobic conditions and beta-hemolytic in anaerobic
conditions. It does not generate CAMP factor.

Educational objective:

Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), one of the most common causes of early

neonatal sepsis, is typically identified by the presence of a narrow zone of beta-hemolysis
