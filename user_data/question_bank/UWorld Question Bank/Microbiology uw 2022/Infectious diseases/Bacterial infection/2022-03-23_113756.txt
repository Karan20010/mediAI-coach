Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection of the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia and is a
surgical emergency. The infection is often polymicrobial, but monomicrobial cases due to
Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) can also occur. S pyogenes is a PYR-
positive, beta-hemolytic, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains.
