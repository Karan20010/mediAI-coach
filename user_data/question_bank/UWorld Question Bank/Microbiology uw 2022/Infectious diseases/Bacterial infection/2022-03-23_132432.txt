Vibrio cholerae is an oxidase-positive, gram-negative, comma-shaped organism that requires
salt for growth and exists naturally in aquatic environments. Transmission occurs due to
ingestion of contaminated food or water. Sporadic cases are often caused by the consumption
of contaminated shellfish; outbreaks may occur in areas where safe water, sanitation, and
health care services are limited.

Pathogens typically cause diarrhea by invading/damaging the intestinal epithelium or releasing
enterotoxins. V cholerae is a noninvasive organism. It clumps together in colonies along the
surface of the small intestine and causes diarrhea via the elaboration of cholera toxin (related
to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin). This enterotoxin enters intestinal
epithelial cells and activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased chloride efflux, reduced
sodium reabsorption, and the subsequent movement of water from the enterocyte to the
gastrointestinal lumen.

Patients typically present with high-volume, watery diarrhea that can cause dehydration and
death within 12 hours. Because the pathogen is noninvasive and the toxin does not cause cell
death, stool microscopy generally reveals no leukocytes or erythrocytes. However, flecks of
mucus are often seen (rice-water stool) due to the activation of goblet cells. Aggressive fluid
resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy.
