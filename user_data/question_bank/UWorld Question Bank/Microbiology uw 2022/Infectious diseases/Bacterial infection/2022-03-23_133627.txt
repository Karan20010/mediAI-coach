This neonate with lethargy, poor feeding, and fever has meningitis. The most common
pathogens in this age group are group B Streptococcus (GBS) and gram-negative bacilli (eg,
Escherichia coli). |n this patient, cerebrospinal fluid shows gram-positive cocci in chains
with a narrow zone of hemolysis indicating GBS infection.

GBS is highly virulent due to the presence of a thick polysaccharide capsule composed of
galactose with terminal sialic acid (SA) residues. These bacterial SA moieties are identical to
SA epitopes on glycoproteins/glycolipids of host cells (molecular mimicry), allowing the
bacteria to evade host defenses. SA residues interact with receptors on phagocytes and are
recognized as self, which down-regulates phagocytosis, oxidative burst generation, and
production of neutrophil extracellular traps. SA residues also inhibit binding of the opsonin
C3b (limits opsonophagocytosis) and the generation of the anaphylatoxin C5a (limits immune
cell recruitment).
