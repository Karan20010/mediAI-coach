antigenic mimicry. GAS and cardiac myocytes have similar antigenic protein sequences.
Therefore, when the immune system mounts a response against GAS, it may also cause
myocarditis and valve destruction over time. GAS pharyngitis is not typically due to exotoxins
and does not classically cause local neuropathies (eg, soft palate paralysis).

(Choice B) Lecithinase (also known as phospholipase C, or Clostridium perfringens alpha-
toxin) is the exotoxin released by C perfringens. This enzyme degrades membrane
phospholipids (including lecithin), leading to cell membrane destruction and cell death. C
perfringens causes gas gangrene.

(Choice C) The shiga toxin of Shigella and the shigalike toxin of enterohemorrhagic
Escherichia coli (EHEC) cause inactivation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. By contrast,
diphtheria toxin inactivates EF-2, not the ribosome itself. Shigella and EHEC cause diarrheal
illnesses.

(Choice D) Pertussis toxin is an AB exotoxin released by Bordetella pertussis that catalyzes
ribosylation of G protein a, subunits. This results in increased cAMP production, which leads to

increased insulin production, lymphocyte and neutrophil dysfunction, and increased sensitivity
to histamine. Classic pertussis has a catarrhal stage (mild upper respiratory symptoms), a
