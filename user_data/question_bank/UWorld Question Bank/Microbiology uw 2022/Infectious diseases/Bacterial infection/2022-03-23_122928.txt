A 32-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to a mass under her right arm.
She first noticed the mass 3 days ago and it has become progressively more swollen and
painful. The patient has also had 5 days of high fever, chills, generalized muscle aches, and
severe fatigue. She works for the city sanitation department and mentions there has been a
recent surge in the rat population due to reduced frequency of trash removal. Temperature is
38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min.
Physical examination reveals an enlarged, tender right axillary lymph node that is
spontaneously draining purulent fluid. Several lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary, and
inguinal regions are enlarged bilaterally. There are no other wounds or rashes. Blood cultures
and an aspirate from a swollen axillary lymph node grow gram-negative bacilli. First-line
treatment for this patient's infection most likely involves a drug with which of the following
mechanisms of action?

©) A. Blockade of dihydrofolic acid formation and reduction
©) B. Disruption of protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit
©) C. Inhibition of the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis

) D. Interference with production of ergosterol during cell membrane formation aoe
