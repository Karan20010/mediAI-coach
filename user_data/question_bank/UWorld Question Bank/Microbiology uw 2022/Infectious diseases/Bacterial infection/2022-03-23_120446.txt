(Choice A) Cryptococcus neoformans, an encapsulated yeast, is a common cause of
meningoencephalitis in patients with advanced AIDS. Although it is a facultative intracellular
pathogen, it does not stain with acid-fast preparations. The pathogen is usually visualized with
India ink, mucicarmine, or methenamine stains.

(Choice B) Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of high-volume diarrhea and biliary
disease in patients with advanced AIDS. This organism's oocytes can be visualized with
modified acid-fast stain, and the pathogen is intracellular. However, it infects epithelial cells
and does not spread through the reticuloendothelial system to the bone marrow or lymph
nodes.

(Choice C) Legionella pneumophila is a gram-negative, intracellular bacteria that often
causes gastrointestinal symptoms prior to pneumonia. However, it does not stain with acid-
fast and does not generally cause lymphadenopathy or bone marrow infection.

(Choice E) Mycobacterium marinum is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that can cause skin

and soft tissue infection following exposure to water (eg, fish tanks). It does not generally
cause several weeks of diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.

(Choice F) Nocardia asteroides, a partially acid-fast organism, typically causes pneumonia

and/or brain abscess. Gastrointestinal symptoms, lymphadenopathy, and bone marrow
