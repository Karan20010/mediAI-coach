Educational objective:

Aminoglycosides work by interfering with the 30S ribosomal subunit and causing the cell to
misread messenger RNA, thereby halting protein synthesis. An important mechanism of
resistance is the methylation of the aminoglycoside-binding portion of the ribosome, which
inhibits the ability of aminoglycoside to interfere with protein translation.
