This patient has a skin and soft-tissue infection (SST1) that developed at the site of a dog bite
relatively soon following the bite. Pasteurella multocida is an organism found in the mouths
of dogs and is responsible for the majority of acute skin infections following a dog bite.
Infection typically occurs within 24 hours of inoculation and has a characteristic mouse-like
odor (indole-positive species). P multocida SSTI can also occur following a cat bite. Other
organisms associated with dog bites include staphylococci, streptococci, and Capnocytophaga
canimorsus. Management includes wound care and antibiotics (eg, amoxicillin-clavulanate).
