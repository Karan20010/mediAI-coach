Educational objective:

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of skin and soft-tissue abscess (eg,
furuncle). Treatment of the abscess with incision and drainage and antibiotics can eliminate
the local infection but does not eliminate colonization of the anterior nares and skin.

Therefore, recurrent infections are common.
