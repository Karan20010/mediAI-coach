A 21-year-old man comes to the urgent care clinic with a lesion on his penis. He noticed a
painful ulcer on the right side of his penis 4 days ago and it has progressively increased in size
since then. The patient has had no dysuria, hematuria, or penile discharge. He is a tourist
visiting New York City from Botswana. He is HIV-positive and is sexually active. The patient
currently takes no medications. He appears comfortable and is afebrile. On genitourinary
examination, there is a 1.5-cm ulceration on the right side of the base of the penis; the lesion is
very tender and soft; has irregular, ragged borders; and is covered with grey exudate. There is
a palpable, tender, enlarged inguinal lymph node in the right groin. The examination is
otherwise unremarkable. A scraping of the ulcer is performed. Polymerase chain reaction
testing for herpes simplex virus is negative, and darkfield microscopy reveals no organisms.
