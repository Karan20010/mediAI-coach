increases cAMP concentration via ADP-ribosylation of a membrane G-protein.

(Choices B and C) Both Clostridium botulinum and C difficile are sporulating bacteria whose
vegetative forms generate exotoxins. However, the exotoxins produced by these bacteria
operate by different mechanisms than edema factor or lethal factor. Botulinum toxin is an
endopeptidase that blocks neuromuscular cholinergic transmission; toxins A and B (generated
by C difficile) inactivate Rho family proteins, leading to a derangement of cytoskeletal structure
and guanosine triphosphate signal transduction.

(Choice D) Shigella dysenteriae invades colonic mucosal cells and produces Shiga toxin, an
exotoxin that cleaves a peptide off the 60S ribosomal subunit and causes irreversible inhibition
of protein synthesis.

(Choice E) Streptococcus pyogenes strains that have been exposed to a specific lysogenic
bacteriophage produce pyrogenic exotoxins, which cause scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic
shock syndrome. These exotoxins are proteases that degrade host cell proteins or
nonspecifically activate T cells (superantigens).

Educational objective:
Bacillus anthracis edema factor is an adenylate cyclase that increases intracellular cyclic AMP,
leading to neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction and tissue edema. This mechanism of
