Question Id: 931
(Choices B and E) Both cardiac tamponade and a saddle pulmonary embolus can cause
obstructive shock that results in multiorgan failure. However, shock due to these conditions is
not usually associated with adrenal insufficiency, and this patient's other clinical features (eg,
neck stiffness, rash) suggest meningococcal meningitis as the primary cause.

(Choice C) Intracerebral hemorrhage with increasing intracranial pressure can present with
severe headache, vomiting, altered mental status, loss of consciousness, and death. Neck
stiffness may be present if the hemorrhage extends into the subarachnoid space and irritates
the meninges. However, this patient's fever, petechial rash, and adrenal insufficiency make
meningococcal meningitis more likely.

(Choice D) Necrotizing pancreatitis typically presents with worsening abdominal pain and
vomiting, and if infected can lead to septic shock and death. However, it is not associated with

neck stiffness and a petechial rash.

Educational objective:

Meningococcal meningitis is a rapidly progressive infection that can spread systemically (ie,
meningococcemia) and lead to septic shock, multiorgan failure, and disseminated
intravascular coagulation. Meningococcemia is also associated with bilateral hemorrhagic
infarction of the adrenal glands, which can result in acute adrenal insufficiency (Waterhouse-
