(Choice H) Toxoplasma may be acquired via consumption of undercooked meat and
unwashed produce or contact with cat feces. It is associated with meningoencephalitis in
immunocompromised patients (eg, advanced AIDS). In immunocompetent individuals,
toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic but may present with flu-like symptoms and
lymphadenopathy; diarrhea would be less likely.
