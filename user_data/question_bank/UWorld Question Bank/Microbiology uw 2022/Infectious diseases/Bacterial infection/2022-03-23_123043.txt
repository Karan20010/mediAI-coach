(Choice A) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole blocks bacterial dihydrofolate formation and
reduction, which inhibits the generation of purine nucleic acids for DNA synthesis and repair.
Although trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be used for plague, it is not a first-line therapy
due to overall low efficacy (mortality rate 20-30%).

(Choice C) Penicillin agents inhibit the bacterial enzyme transpeptidase, which catalyzes the
final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan elongation. Although penicillin antibiotics are often
administered with gentamicin to treat infection with gram-positive organisms (penicillin disrupts
the cell wall so gentamicin can enter the cytoplasm), Y pestis is a gram-negative pathogen;
therefore, penicillins are not helpful.

(Choice D) Azole antibiotics inhibit the fungal enzyme 14 alpha-demethylase, which helps
generate ergosterol. Ergosterol is a crucial component of the cell membrane of yeasts.
Bacteria would be unaffected by inhibition of this fungal enzyme.

(Choice E) Vancomycin binds to the D-alanyl—D-alanine terminus of peptidoglycan, which
blocks transpeptidase from elongating the peptidoglycan chain. Although vancomycin is
sometimes used for streptococcal or staphylococcal adenitis, it has no efficacy against gram-
negative pathogens.
