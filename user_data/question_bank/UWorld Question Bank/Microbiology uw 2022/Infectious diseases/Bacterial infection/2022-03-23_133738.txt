Mechanism of action of bacterial toxins

Organism Toxin Microbiology
Corynebacterium Diphtheria | Inactivates EF-2 via ribosylation, thus inhibiting host
diphtheriae toxin cell protein synthesis
Pseudomonas : Inactivates EF-2 via ribosylation, thus inhibiting host
. Exotoxin A
aeruginosa cell protein synthesis
__ |Superantigen that acts locally in the gastrointestinal
Enterotoxin . -
Staphylococcus tract, causing vomiting
aureus ' Superantigen that stimulates T cells, leading to
TSS Toxin | |
widespread cytokine release & shock
. Induces actin depolymerization, leading to mucosal
Clostridioides | | ;
_ Cytotoxin B |cell death, necrosis of colonic mucosal surfaces &
difficile ;
pseudomembrane formation
Clostridium Botulinum | Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine at the
botulinum toxin neuromuscular junction, resulting in flaccid paralysis
