(Choice B) Many bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae) are resistant to phagocytosis due
to the presence of a polysaccharide capsule. However, B anthracis has a polypeptide, not
polysaccharide, capsule.

(Choice C) Staphylococcus aureus produces protein A, which binds the Fc portion of IgG.
This inhibits opsonization and complement-mediated killing of the bacteria.

(Choice D) Intracellular polyphosphate granules are characteristic of Corynebacterium
diphtheriae; they can be visualized on microscopy after growing the pathogen on Loeffler
medium and staining it with methylene blue.

(Choice E) Peritrichous flagella (flagella distributed uniformly over the entire surface of a
bacterial cell) are not present on the surface of B anthracis as this organism is nonmotile.
Peritrichous flagella are characteristic of highly motile organisms such as Proteus mirabilis.
