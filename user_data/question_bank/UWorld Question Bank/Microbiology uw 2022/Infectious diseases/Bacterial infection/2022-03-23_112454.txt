A major polysaccharide component of the fungal cell wall is 1,3-beta-D-glucan. Caspofungin
and the other echinocandin antifungals (eg, micafungin) block glucan synthesis. Whereas
polyene and azole antifungals target the fungal cell membrane, the echinocandins are unique
in that they suppress fungal cell wall synthesis. Caspofungin is most active against Candida
species and Aspergillus. |t is not active against Cryptococcus neoformans and has limited
activity against Mucor and Rhizopus species. This patient likely has an infection due to a
caspofungin-resistant strain of Candida (uncommon).
