This child has high fever and rapidly progressive respiratory distress (eg, retractions,
stridor) with a swollen epiglottis ("thumbprint sign") on lateral neck x-ray. These findings are
consistent with epiglottitis, an uncommon but potentially fatal infection of the upper airway.
Progressive epiglottic inflammation can also cause dysphagia and drooling with pooled oral
secretions, and the potential for acute airway obstruction makes rapid diagnosis critical.

Epiglottitis once occurred mainly in young children (age ~3) due to high rates of infection with
Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). With widespread vaccination against Hib, rates of
epiglottitis dramatically declined; now, adults and school-aged children are more commonly
affected. H influenzae remains the most common pathogen, including Hib (due to waning
immunity) and nontypeable strains for which there are no vaccines. Hib epiglottitis is often
associated with concomitant bacteremia, and Gram stain would show gram-negative
coccobacilli consistent with H influenzae.
