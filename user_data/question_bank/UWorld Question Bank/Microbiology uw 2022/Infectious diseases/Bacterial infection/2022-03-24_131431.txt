(Choice I) Streptococcus viridans is the most common etiologic agent in subacute bacterial
endocarditis (SBE) following dental work. SBE occurs most frequently in patients with a
preexisting valvular abnormality (eg, rheumatic heart disease, congenital heart
malformations). The presentation is typically subacute (over weeks rather than days).
