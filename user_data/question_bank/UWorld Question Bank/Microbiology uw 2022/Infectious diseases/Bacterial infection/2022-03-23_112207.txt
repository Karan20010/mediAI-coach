This patient with low-grade fever, sore throat, persistent cough, and chest x-ray evidence of a
bilateral patchy infiltrate likely has "walking pneumonia", a form of atypical pneumonia
usually caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Chlamydia pneumoniae.

Unlike most bacteria, Mycoplasma and Chlamydia do not have cell walls composed of
peptidoglycan. Mycoplasma completely lacks a cell wall, while Chlamydia has a cell wall
composed of an alternate protein. Therefore, these pathogens cannot be seen on Gram stain
(which stains peptidoglycan) and cannot be treated with antibacterial agents that target
peptidoglycan such as penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, or carbapenems (Choice B).
Treatment requires a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor such as a macrolide or
tetracycline.

Legionella pneumophila is another common cause of atypical pneumonia. However, this

pathogen usually is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, diarrhea), more severe
Clinical illness (eg, high fever), and lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray.
