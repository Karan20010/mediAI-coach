(Choices C and D) Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gram-negative rods
that can cause UTI, most commonly in patients with indwelling Foley catheters. However, in
contrast to E coli, these organisms are lactose nonfermenters (ie, do not form pink colonies on
MacConkey agar).

(Choice E) Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the second-most frequent cause of UTI after E
coli in young, sexually active women but is less common in the elderly population. Moreover,
staphylococci are gram-positive, and therefore would not grow on MacConkey agar.
