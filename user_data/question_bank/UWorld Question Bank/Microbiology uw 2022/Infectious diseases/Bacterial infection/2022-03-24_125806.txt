Typhoidal Sa/monella species invade enterocytes, travel from the apical to the basolateral end
of the cell in vacuoles, and emerge in the intestinal submucosa. Here, the organism is
phagocytosed by macrophages but is able to evade destruction due to a specialized capsular
antigen (Vi) that impairs the macrophage-mediated oxidative burst. The pathogen
subsequently replicates in an unchecked fashion within macrophages and spreads through the
lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system, leading to widespread, systemic illness.

Manifestations typically develop over weeks in a step-wise fashion. Patients usually develop a
progressive fever, often with relative bradycardia (pulse-temperature dissociation),
followed by abdominal pain, salmon-colored macules on the trunk ("rose spots"), and
constipation or diarrhea. Dissemination through the reticuloendothelial system often causes
hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, and leukopenia. Later, ulceration of Peyer patches (lymphoid
aggregations in the small intestine submucosa) can result in gastrointestinal bleeding or
intestinal perforation. Antibiotic treatment is required to prevent complications and death.
