urination for 2 days and right-sided back pain for 1 day. Her temperature is 38.3 C (101 F),
blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 94/min, and respirations are 18/min. Examination is
notable for right-sided flank tenderness to palpation. Urinalysis is positive for nitrites,
leukocyte esterase, and bacteria. Urine and blood cultures are obtained, and the patient is

started on antibiotic therapy. The next day, urine culture grows >100,000 colony-forming
units/mL of Escherichia coli. The organism is found to have a methyltransferase that
