Diphtheria is caused by infection with toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a non-
spore—forming, gram-positive rod that is transmitted by aerosolized droplets. Cases are rare in
the United States due to widespread vaccination efforts. However, infections can occur in
those who received inadequate childhood vaccines or those who did not receive booster
vaccination every 10 years.

The manifestations of diphtheria are due to the elaboration of diphtheria toxin (DT), an
exotoxin that irreversibly inhibits host protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of elongation
factor-2. Local effects include pharyngitis and tonsillitis, often with thick, grey-white
pseudomembranes. Systemic effects are caused by the absorption of DT into the
bloodstream and include potentially life-threatening cardiac (eg, myocarditis) and neurologic
complications.

The primary treatment for diphtheria is the urgent administration of diphtheria antitoxin,
which contains preformed, neutralizing antibodies that binds and inactivates circulating
toxin. Because it cannot inhibit the toxin that has already entered cells, it should be
administered as soon as possible. Antibiotic therapy (eg, penicillin, erythromycin) is also given
to reduce continued elaboration of DT from the nasopharyngeal infection.
