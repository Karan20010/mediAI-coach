as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of diagnosis.

(Choice A) Vaccination is an important public health strategy for control of meningococcal
disease in general, but does not play a role in post-exposure prophylaxis. Immunity following
a post-exposure vaccination does not occur in time to prevent disease.

(Choice B) Aperson's risk for infection is 500-1,000 times greater following an exposure to a
meningococcal disease patient, and disease onset can be rapid. Therefore, observation alone
is not an appropriate strategy for exposed close contacts.

(Choice C) Although penicillin can be used for treatment of susceptible meningococcal
infections, it has not been shown to eliminate nasal carriage or prevent secondary cases.
Therefore, it should not be used for chemoprophylaxis.

(Choice E) Sulfamethoxazole was the first agent to be used as chemoprophylaxis for
