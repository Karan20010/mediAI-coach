Diphtheria

Epidemiology

¢ Endemic in developing countries due to inadequate

vaccination but rare in developed countries

Microbiology/
pathogenesis

Corynebacterium diphtheriae colonize respiratory tract &
secrete diphtheria toxin, the primary virulence factor
Diphtheria toxin is an AB exotoxin that inhibits protein
synthesis by ADP-ribosylation of EF-2

Toxin acts locally, causing respiratory cell necrosis with
formation of fibrinous, coagulative exudates

Clinical symptoms

Sore throat
Fever

¢ Cervical adenopathy

Pharyngeal exudates/coalescing pseudomembrane
