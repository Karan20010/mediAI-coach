(Choices A and C) Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for infections,
including CAUTI; glucosuria (spontaneous or due to glucosuric medications [eg, sodium-
glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors]) further increases the risk. Female patients are also at
increased risk, likely due to a shorter transit distance to the bladder. However, the duration of
catheterization has a higher attributable risk for CAUTI compared to these factors.

(Choice D) Smoking may increase susceptibility to bladder infection but only minimally
increases CAUTI risk; moreover, this patient's light and remote smoking history represents a
less significant risk factor than her extended duration of catheterization.

(Choice E) Urinary incontinence is the most common inappropriate indication for placement of
an indwelling catheter. However, incontinence itself is not associated with a significant
increase in the risk for CAUTI.
