innate immune cells (eg, macrophages), triggering the release of endogenous pyrogens (eg,
IL-1, IL-6, prostaglandins) and inflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha,
interferon). These cytokines disrupt endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability,
resulting in profound hypotension and end-organ dysfunction/failure.

(Choices A and C) Core polysaccharide and O antigen are also components of LPS.
However, core polysaccharide, which contains a short chain of sugars that differs among
bacteria, is not involved in the virulence of LPS. Similarly, O antigen is a variable
polysaccharide on the outer surface and is a target for recognition by the host immune system
but is not directly responsible for the manifestations of septic shock.

(Choice D) Peptidoglycan is a component of the bacterial cell wall that provides structural
integrity and protection from environmental forces (eg, osmotic stress). Peptidoglycan does
not play a role in the development of gram-negative septic shock.

(Choice E) Many gram-negative bacteria (including E coli) have surface lipoproteins (SLPs),
or proteins attached to a lipid anchor, projecting from the inner or outer membrane. These
SLPs help move nutrients into the cell and facilitate immune evasion but are not responsible
for causing septic shock.
