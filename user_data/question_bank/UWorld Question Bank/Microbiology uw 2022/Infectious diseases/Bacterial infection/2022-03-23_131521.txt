Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive bacterium that grows in grape-like clusters.
Approximately 30% of individuals in the community-setting are colonized with S aureus. The
pathogen is transmitted by direct contact, colonizes the anterior nares, and spreads to the
skin. Defects in the mucosal or cutaneous barrier can lead to invasion. The most common
manifestation is skin and soft-tissue abscess; patients usually develop a localized pustule
that evolves over days into a painful nodule with a necrotic, purulent center and surrounding
indurated erythema. Treatment with incision/drainage and oral antibiotics is usually curative of
the localized infection. However, oral antibiotics do not eliminate S aureus colonization of the
nares and skin so recurrent infections are common.

Colonization with methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) is associated with a low risk of illness.
In contrast, methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) colonization is much more likely to cause
disease due to expression of associated virulence factors (eg, leukocidin).
