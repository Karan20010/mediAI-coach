The public health department of a developing country performs an epidemiologic study to
assess the nationwide incidence of upper respiratory infections among children. The data
show a high rate of childhood bacterial pharyngitis. Current practice guidelines indicate that a
rapid test should be performed in children to identify the presence of bacterial antigens. If this
test is negative, a throat culture, the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, is then performed.
To offset cost and avoid losing patients to follow-up, the department is considering
recommending the empiric use of penicillin for the treatment of suspected bacterial
pharyngitis. Which of the following would be expected to decrease after long-term

implementation of this guideline?

©) A. Deaths associated with diarrheal illness

() B. Diagnoses of serum sickness-like reactions
©) C. Incidence of nephritic syndrome

©) D. Need for cardiac surgery

() E. Use of broad-spectrum antibiotics
