Question Id: 14883

(Choice A) Antigenic variation involves rapid mutation of surface antigens, which limits the
ability of immunoglobulin formed during previous infection to prevent future infections. It is
seen primarily with viruses (eg, influenza) and certain bacteria (eg, Neisseria meningitidis);
however, GBS is virulent primarily due to SA on its capsule, not antigenic variation.

(Choice B) Catalase-producing organisms (eg, Listeria, Staphylococcus) can break down
hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water, which limits oxidative damage. Listeria
monocytogenes can cause neonatal meningitis, but Gram stain would show gram-positive
rods, not cocci; Staphylococcus species are an uncommon cause of neonatal meningitis and
are gram-positive cocci in clusters, not chains.

(Choice C) Increased uptake of extracellular iron, an essential micronutrient for most bacteria,

is not a major virulence factor for Streptococcus species.

(Choice D) Lipopolysaccharide is a major virulence factor of gram-negative bacteria such as
E coli. \t limits host opsonophagocytic killing. However, GBS does not have
lipopolysaccharide because it is a gram-positive organism.

(Choice F) Rapid, flagella-mediated motion is a virulence factor because it assists bacterial
invasion (eg, E coli). However, GBS does not have flagella; it has pili, cell wall appendages

that aid in bacterial adhesion.
