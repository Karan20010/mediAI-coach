spectrum antibiotics due to the high incidence of polymicrobial infection.

(Choice A) A hydrophila is an oxidase-positive, nonâ€”lactose-fermenting, gram-negative rod.
It can cause gastroenteritis, wound infections, and bacteremia following exposure to
contaminated water.

(Choice B) C perfringens is a large, spore-forming, anaerobic, gram-positive rod that is
catalase and coagulase negative. It is implicated in food poisoning, clostridial myonecrosis
(gas gangrene), and bacteremia. On blood agar, it produces a double zone of beta-hemolysis.

(Choice C) S aureus is a gram-positive coccus that grows in clusters. It is catalase positive,
coagulase positive, and PYR negative. S aureus produces large colonies and demonstrates
beta-hemolysis. Like S pyogenes, S aureus can also cause monomicrobial necrotizing
fasciitis.

(Choice D) S agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is a coagulase- and catalase-negative, PYR
negative, gram-positive coccus that grows in chains. Colonies produce a narrow zone of beta-
hemolysis that enhances when plated perpendicular to S aureus (positive CAMP test). S
agalactiae can cause skin and soft tissue infections, as well as newborn sepsis and meningitis.
