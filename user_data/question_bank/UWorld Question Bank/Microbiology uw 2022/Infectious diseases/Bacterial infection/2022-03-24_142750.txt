(Choice A) Inhaled, racemic epinephrine can be used in the treatment of croup, which usually
presents with cough, inspiratory stridor, and/or hoarseness. Epinephrine could reduce airway

swelling in patients with diphtheria, but it would not inhibit the local and systemic effects of the

toxin.

(Choice B) C diphtheriae is noninvasive and does not typically enter the bloodstream.
Although antibiotics are administered in acute infection, this component of therapy is less
important than providing antitoxin to neutralize DT.

(Choice C) Corticosteroids are sometimes used in the treatment of epiglottitis to reduce
airway inflammation and limit the risk of airway compromise. Epiglottitis manifestations
typically include stridor, drooling, respiratory distress, and the assumption of the "tripod"
position. Most cases are caused by infection with Haemophilus influenzae type B in
unvaccinated individuals.

(Choice E) Active immunization with the diphtheria toxoid (given as part of the childhood
DTaP vaccine) prevents diphtheria. Diphtheria toxoid can also be given as part of tetanus
boosters in adults. However, the immune response to vaccination is slow; in undervaccinated
patients who are acutely ill, administration of preformed antitoxin antibodies is preferred.
