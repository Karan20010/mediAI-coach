Researchers studying fungal pathogens isolated an ergosterol biosynthetic gene by
polymerase chain reaction. Using homologous recombination, they then developed a new
strain of Candida with a mutated allele for that gene. The mutant strain was cultured in the
presence of several different antifungal agents. Compared to isolates from the wild-type
strain, isolates from the mutant Candida strain exhibited enhanced growth in the presence of

drug X. Further investigation revealed that the mechanism of resistance to drug X was a
decrease in ergosterol incorporation into the cell membrane. Based on this data, drug X is
likely to be most closely related to which of the following antifungal agents?
