Campylobacter jejuni is a motile, oxidase-positive, gram-negative, curved rod that is a
leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. This pathogen resides in the gastrointestinal tract of
a wide range of mammals and is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. Most cases arise when
humans ingest contaminated food, particularly undercooked poultry or unpasteurized milk,
but a minority are caused by close contact with domesticated animals (eg, dogs, farm
animals).

C jejuni is enteroinvasive and typically causes fever, abdominal pain, and diarrhea that may
be bloody. Stool studies usually reveal inflammation (ie, blood, leukocytes); culture of stool
(enriched media at 42 C [107.6 F] and microaerophilic conditions) is diagnostic. Most cases
are self-limited and resolve within a week with supportive treatment.
