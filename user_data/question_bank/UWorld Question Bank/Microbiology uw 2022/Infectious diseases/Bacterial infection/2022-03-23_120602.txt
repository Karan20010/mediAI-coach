Educational objective:

Clostridium septicum is a spore-forming, exotoxin-producing, gram-positive organism that is
the most common cause of spontaneous gas gangrene (eg, rapid-onset pain, hemorrhagic
bullae, tissue crepitus). Underlying colonic malignancy is the greatest risk factor for infection.
