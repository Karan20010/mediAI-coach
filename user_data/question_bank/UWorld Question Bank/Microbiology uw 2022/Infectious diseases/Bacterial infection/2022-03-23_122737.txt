Patients with indwelling bladder catheters are at increased risk for urinary tract infections
(UTIs) caused by both typical (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
Saprophyticus, Proteus mirabilis) and opportunistic (eg, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, other
Staphylococci, fungal) organisms. This patient's culture results are consistent with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the only non-lactose-fermenting, Gram-negative rod listed. It is
also the only one that is oxidase positive.
