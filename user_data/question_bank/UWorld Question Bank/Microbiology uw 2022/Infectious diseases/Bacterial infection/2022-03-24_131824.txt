A 65-year-old man is admitted to the intensive care unit with second- and third-degree burns
over 25% of his total body surface area. Intravenous fluids and analgesics are administered,
and his wounds are cleaned and debrided. After 7 days, the patient develops a fever and his
leukocyte count rises to 16,000 cells/uL. Examination of the burns on his left leg shows
surrounding warmth, erythema, and induration. Gram stain of his wound tissue is shown in the
image below.
