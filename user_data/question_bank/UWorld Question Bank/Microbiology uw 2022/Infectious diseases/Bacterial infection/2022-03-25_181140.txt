5 (Choice A) Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination uses Mycobacterium bovis, which shares

: antigens with tuberculous mycobacteria. This vaccination primes the lymphocyte response

8 against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, therefore protecting against infection, morbidity, and

° mortality. Patients with previous BCG vaccination can have false-positive (not false negative)

it TST.

13 (Choice B) TB infection is primarily controlled by macrophages and T lymphocytes. The
humoral immune system plays a minimal role and does not contribute to TST induration.
16 Therefore, an autoantibody disorder is unlikely to cause anergy.

18 (Choice D) Induration typically takes 48-72 hours to form following TST. This patient's test
was negative at 72 hours, an appropriate time frame for TST interpretation.

a (Choice E) Acid-fast bacillus stain and TST do not differentiate nontuberculous from
tuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a common
cause of a false-positive (not a false-negative) TST. This patient's history of residence in a TB-
endemic country, hemoptysis, night sweats, and upper lobe infiltrate are all highly suspicious
for pulmonary TB.
