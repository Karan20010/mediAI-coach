mixed inflammatory infiltrate. Modified silver stain can also identify the organism.

(Choice A) Actinomyces israelii is a branching, gram-positive bacterium that grows in
filaments. It primarily causes a cervicofacial infection that begins as a slowly growing mass
which evolves into multiple abscesses and draining sinus tracts with yellow ("sulfur") granules.
Histopathology typically shows chronic inflammatory granulation tissue surrounding dense
fibrosis.

(Choice C) Blastomyces dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that primarily causes acute or
chronic pneumonia but can also spread to the skin, leading to verrucous lesions with irregular
borders. Culture is usually required for diagnosis and histology will show granulomas.

(Choice D) Mycobacterium marinum is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that is found in fresh
and salt water. It can inoculate areas of broken skin (eg, abrasions) and result in an infection
marked by cutaneous papules, ulcers, and scarring. Histology reveals granulomatous
inflammation.

(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus skin infections (eg, folliculitis) are more common in
patients with HIV. However, these infections typically develop over a few days and are
associated with purulent fluid.
