transferases) and mutated porins.

(Choice B) Structural alteration of enzymes involved in DNA winding-unwinding is the means
by which many microorganisms become resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics.
Fluoroquinolones inhibit the bacterial enzymes DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and
topoisomerase IV.

(Choice C) Structural alteration of enzymes involved in RNA synthesis is the mechanism
through which organisms become resistant to rifampin. Rifampin inhibits the bacterial DNA-
dependent RNA polymerase, thereby preventing the transcription of DNA into MRNA.

(Choice D) Decreased activity of bacterial catalase-peroxidase is a mechanism of
mycobacterial resistance to INH. Mycobacterial catalase-peroxidase is required for the initial
enzymatic conversion of INH to its active metabolite within the mycobacterial cells; without this
enzyme, INH is unable to inhibit mycobacterial mycolic acid synthesis.

(Choice E) Increased activity of enzymes involved in cell wall polysaccharide synthesis is the
means by which mycobacteria develop resistance to ethambutol. Ethambutol interferes
specifically with mycobacterial peptidoglycan cell wall synthesis, possibly through inhibition of
arabinosyl transferase. This drug is ineffective against organisms other than mycobacteria.
