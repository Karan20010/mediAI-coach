This elderly patient with fever, hypotension, and altered mental status has sepsis. The
presence of Escherichia coli bacteremia suggests the source is a urinary tract infection
(UTI). E coliis a normal gastrointestinal commensal organism. UTI arises when the organism
contaminates the periurethral area and uses special adhesive proteins called pili to attach to
and ascend the uroepithelium. Predisposing factors include urinary obstruction (eg, benign
prostatic hypertrophy), fecal incontinence, neurogenic bladder (eg, due to diabetes), and
indwelling catheterization.

E coliis the leading cause of UTIs, and most cases of E coli bacteremia are due to
hematologic dissemination from the urinary system. Bloodstream infection can lead to
sepsis due to overwhelming release of inflammatory cytokines; clinical manifestations include
hyper/hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, leukocytosis, and organ dysfunction (eg,
confusion, acute kidney failure).
