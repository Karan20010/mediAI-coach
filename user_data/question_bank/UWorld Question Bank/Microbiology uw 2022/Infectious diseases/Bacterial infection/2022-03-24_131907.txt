Burn patients are at increased risk of bacterial infection due to loss of the barrier function of
the skin, post-burn immune dysfunction, and lack of blood flow to necrotic areas. Common
pathogens include Gram-positive (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species) and
Gram-negative (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and
Acinetobacter species) bacteria.

This patient's burn is infected with Gram-negative rods that are oxidase-positive and non-
lactose- fermenting, making P aeruginosa the most likely pathogen. Cephalosporins such as
cefepime and ceftazidime have good anti-pseudomonal coverage.
