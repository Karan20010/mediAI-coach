This patient with recurrent boils and skin abscesses is likely colonized with Staphylococcus
aureus, a gram-positive cocci that grows in clusters. Methicillin-resistant strains are able to
grow in the presence of oxacillin due to the acquisition of a mobile genetic element that
contains the mecA gene, which encodes for penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2a. PBPs
catalyze peptidoglycan cross-linking during cell wall synthesis; they are the target of beta-
lactam medications, which bind to and irreversibly destroy the enzyme. Unlike other PBPs,
PBP 2a has a low affinity for beta-lactams and continues to cross-link peptidoglycan in the
presence of oxacillin, methicillin, cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin), and other beta-lactam
medications.

Therefore, treatment of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) generally requires the use of a
nonâ€”beta-lactam drug. Common medications for MRSA include trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (inhibits 2 steps in folate synthesis), clindamycin (inhibits bacterial protein
synthesis by binding to the 50s ribosomal subunit), doxycycline (inhibits protein synthesis by
binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit), or vancomycin (inhibits integration of peptidoglycan
subunits) (Choices B, C, D, and E).
