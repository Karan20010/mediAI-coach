This patient undergoing chemotherapy has neutropenic fever, defined as a temperature
>38.3 C (>101 F) and an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm: (eg, 700 leukocytes x [20%
neutrophils +10% bands] = 210 neutrophils/mms). Neutropenic fever without an identifiable
source (eg, normal chest x-ray, normal urine culture, normal examination) is believed to be
caused by translocation of endogenous bacteria into the bloodstream from mucositis, which
results from chemotherapy-induced disruption of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Patients with
severe neutropenia are at higher risk for overwhelming bacterial infection due to a blunted
neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response.

This patient's very rapid onset (eg, 4 hours) of fever and signs of septic shock (eg,
hypotension, tachycardia) is most consistent with a gram-negative bacterial

infection (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Gram-negative infections are frequently identified
as the causative pathogen of neutropenic fever and are associated with a rapid clinical
deterioration due to the production of endotoxins, which stimulate the widespread release of
proinflammatory mediators (eg, tumor necrosis factor) that results in hemodynamic
decompensation. Gram-positive infections (eg, from indwelling catheters) also occur but tend
to be less virulent with a slower onset and less severe course.
