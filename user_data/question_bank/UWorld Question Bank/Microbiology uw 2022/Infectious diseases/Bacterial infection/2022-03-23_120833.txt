This patient with tender axillary and epitrochlear lymphadenopathy has histopathologic findings
consistent with catscratch disease, caused by Bartonella henselae infection. B henselae is
a fastidious, gram-negative coccobacillus that is transmitted to humans (typically children
and young adults) through a scratch or bite from an infected cat.

Askin lesion (eg, erythematous papule, vesicle) usually forms at the inoculation site (eg,
hand, arm) within days of the scratch; however, this lesion may go unnoticed. Within weeks,
patients develop tender lymphadenopathy proximal to the skin lesion (eg, axillary,
epitrochlear). Additional symptoms may include fever, malaise, aches, and night sweats. The
diagnosis is often made clinically and confirmed with serologic testing, but biopsy of the
affected lymph node may be performed in some cases. Histopathology often shows
necrotizing granulomas and stellate-shaped microabscesses (ie, collections of
neutrophils). A silver stain (eg, Warthin-Starry) can be used to highlight the organisms.

The symptoms are typically self-limiting in immunocompetent patients, and the
lymphadenopathy often resolves within a few months. However, antimicrobial therapy (eg,
azithromycin) is typically recommended to accelerate recovery and decrease the likelihood of
systemic disease.
