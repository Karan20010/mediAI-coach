This patient most likely has typhoid fever, an invasive Sa/monella infection. Salmonella
species are gram-negative, non-lactose-fermenting, motile enteric rods divided into
nontyphoidal and typhoidal strains. Both strains penetrate enterocytes, where they travel in
vacuoles from the apical to the basolateral end of the cell and invade the lamina propria.
However, the pathogenesis then diverges, as follows:

Â¢ Nontyphoidal strains (eg, S Enteritidis) are phagocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages
in the lamina propria and induce a massive inflammatory response with neutrophilic
infiltration. This cytokine-mediated response causes gastroenteritis (eg, watery diarrhea,
abdominal pain, fever), which usually self-resolves, as in this patient's prior history.

In contrast, typhoidal strains contain specialized virulence factors (eg, Vi capsular
antigen) that inhibit neutrophil recruitment and phagocytosis, limiting the acute
inflammatory response that helps contain nontyphoidal species. It also inhibits
macrophages from generating an oxidative burst to destroy the bacteria, allowing the
pathogen to undergo extensive, unchecked intraphagocytic replication and
dissemination through the lymphatic and reticuloendothelial system. This results in
typhoid fever, as seen in this patient.
