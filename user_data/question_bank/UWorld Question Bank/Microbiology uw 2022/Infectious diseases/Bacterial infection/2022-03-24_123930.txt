Manifestations begin approximately a week after transmission of the typhoidal strain, which
typically occurs via consumption of food or water contaminated by human feces in regions of
poor sanitation. Initial symptoms include an escalating fever that is often associated with
relative bradycardia (pulse-temperature dissociation). A week later, patients typically
develop abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, hepatosplenomegaly, and transient salmon-
colored macules (rose spots) on the trunk. Blood culture is diagnostic.
