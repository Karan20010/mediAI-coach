(Choice B) Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin) is the major component of the cell wall in
gram-negative, not gram-positive, bacteria (some sources erroneously report that L
monocytogenes contains lipopolysaccharide). Endotoxin activates complement, coagulation,
and fibrinolysis, which can lead to septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

(Choice C) Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic gram-positive rod, produces an exotoxin
(botulinum toxin) that inhibits the synaptic transmission of motor neurons. Patients typically
develop descending, symmetric motor deficits; minimal sensory changes; and no fever.

(Choice D) Pathogenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produce an exotoxin that
inhibits elongation factor in host cells, which causes pseudomembranous pharyngitis and
myocarditis. Although C diphtheriae is a gram-positive rod, it does not cause febrile
gastroenteritis.

Educational objective:

Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular, gram-positive rod that most often causes
febrile gastroenteritis. Pathogenesis is mediated largely by listeriolysin O, an enzyme that
creates pores in phagosomes, which allows the bacteria to escape lysosomal destruction.
Pregnant women in the third trimester are at greatest risk; infection increases the risk of fetal
demise, early labor, and neonatal infection.
