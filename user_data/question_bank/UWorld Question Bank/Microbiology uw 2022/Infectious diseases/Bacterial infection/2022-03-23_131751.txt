(Choice A) Efflux pumps are generally globular proteins with multiple domains. They reside
in the bacterial cell membrane and excrete toxic substances from the interior of the cell.
Bacteria can use efflux pumps to generate antibiotic resistance to drugs that operate in the
interior of the cell, such as fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.

(Choices B and C) The bacterial cell wall of S pyogenes provides mechanical support and
protects it from osmotic lysis. It is composed primarily of peptidoglycan, which forms a mesh-
like, cross-linked polymer of peptides and sugars.

(Choice E) Porins in the cell membrane aid in the movement of nutrients into bacterial cells.
They are composed of protein strands that group together to form a barrel (beta-barrel).
