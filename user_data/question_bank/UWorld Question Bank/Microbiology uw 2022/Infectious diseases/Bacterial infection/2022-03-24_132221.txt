Sputum cultures are typically performed during CF pulmonary exacerbation to identify the
pathogen and guide antimicrobial management. In addition to regular blood (eg,
Streptococcus), chocolate (eg, H influenzae), and MacConkey (eg, Pseudomonas) agars,
sputum should also be plated on mannitol salt agar (eg, S aureus) and B cepaciaâ€”selective
agar.
