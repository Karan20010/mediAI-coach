This patient's annular, erythematous rash with central clearing suggests erythema migrans
(EM), the hallmark feature of early localized Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the
spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick during blood
feeding. B burgdorferi replicates at the site of inoculation, which generates a rash 7-14 days
after transmission in most patients.

EM typically begins as a confluent macule that expands outward as B burgdorferi spreads
through the dermis. Most cases evolve over days into an annular lesion with central
clearing, which resembles a bull's-eye. Pain is rare, and pruritis is typically mild or absent.
However, some patients have systemic manifestations (eg, malaise, fever, headache).
Because many patients with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite, suspicion for Lyme disease
should be raised in any individual from an endemic area who develops a characteristic EM
rash.
