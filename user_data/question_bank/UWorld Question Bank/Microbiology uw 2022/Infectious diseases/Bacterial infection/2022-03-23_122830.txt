Ehrlichia chaffeensis is harbored by white-tailed deer in the southwestern, southeastern,
and mid-Atlantic United States. It is transmitted to humans by tick bite (eg, lone star tick) and
subsequently spreads to tissue rich in mononuclear cells (eg, bone marrow, lymph nodes,
liver, spleen), leading to nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, chills, myalgia, headache),
maculopapular rash, and significant laboratory abnormalities (eg, lymphopenia,
thrombocytopenia, elevated aminotransferases).

E chaffeensis replicates in membrane-bound vacuoles within the cytoplasm of monocytes and
can be visualized on peripheral blood or buffy coat examination as mulberry-shaped,
intraleukocytic inclusions (morulae). Treatment with antibiotics (eg, doxycycline) is usually
curative.
