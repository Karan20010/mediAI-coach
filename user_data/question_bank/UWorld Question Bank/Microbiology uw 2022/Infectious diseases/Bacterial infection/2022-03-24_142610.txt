Educational objective:

Listeria is a relatively common foodborne illness associated with outbreaks after the
consumption of contaminated food, particularly processed meats and dairy products. Healthy
patients may develop gastroenteritis; patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity are at risk
for invasive infection (eg, sepsis, meningoencephalitis); and listeriosis in pregnancy is
associated with adverse fetal outcomes (eg, fetal death, premature birth).
