ceftaroline).
(Choice A) Resistance to tetracycline and sulfonamides is due at least in part to a decrease
in the levels of drug accumulation due to decreased uptake and/or increased efflux.
(Choice B) Approximately 95% of S aureus isolates in the United States produce

penicillinase, which causes penicillin resistance by breaking penicillin's B-lactam ring.
However, nafcillin is penicillinase-stable (along with oxacillin and methicillin).

(Choices C and D) Mutations in DNA gyrase cause resistance to quinolone antibiotics.
Mutations in RNA polymerase cause resistance to rifampin.

Educational objective:

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is resistant to all B-lactam antibiotics, including
beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics, as it has an altered penicillin-binding protein that does not
bind B-lactams effectively.
