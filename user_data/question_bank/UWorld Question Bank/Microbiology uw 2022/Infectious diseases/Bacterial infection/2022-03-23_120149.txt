Educational objective:

Bacillary angiomatosis is primarily seen in patients with advanced AIDS. It is caused by the
gram-negative bacterium Bartonella henselae, which is typically transmitted by a cat scratch.
Patients usually develop highly vascular, violaceous, cutaneous lesions over weeks or
months. Histology of the lesions reveals large endothelial cells forming small vascular
channels with a surrounding inflammatory infiltrate.
