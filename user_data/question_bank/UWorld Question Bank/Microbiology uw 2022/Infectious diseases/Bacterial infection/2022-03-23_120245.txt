This patient's presentation and the finding of gram-negative diplococci highly suggest
meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis. N meningitidis is transmitted by direct contact with
contaminated respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets. As a result, people with close
or intimate contact (eg, household contacts, kissing contacts, health care workers who directly
contacted secretions) are at markedly increased risk of meningococcal infection. Antibiotic
chemoprophylaxis can prevent these secondary cases if given promptly. A history of
meningococcal vaccination does not preclude the need for antibiotic chemoprophylaxis.

Of the listed agents, rifampin is the only effective choice. Rifampin penetrates well into all
body compartments, including the upper respiratory tract, and will eliminate nasopharyngeal
colonization. Other effective agents include ciprofloxacin (not routinely used in children due to
concerns about connective tissue injury) and intramuscular ceftriaxone, which is effective but
not widely used due to the painful mode of administration. Chemoprophylaxis should be given
as soon as possible, preferably within 24 hours of diagnosis.
