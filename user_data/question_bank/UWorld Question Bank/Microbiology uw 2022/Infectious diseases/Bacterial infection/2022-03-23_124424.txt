The 50% infectious dose (ID,,) corresponds to the minimum number of organisms required to
cause disease in 50% of exposed individuals. When controlling for the route of exposure and
overall health of the host, the ID.. is generally correlated inversely with degree of disease
communicability.

The organism in Line 2 (Salmonella) has an ID;,of approximately 10â€™, whereas the organism in
Line 1 has a much lower ID,, of about 102. Of the given options, the organism with the lowest

ID;, is Shigella flexneri. Depending on the species, as few as 10 Shigella organisms can
cause disease.
