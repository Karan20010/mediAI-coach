Educational objective:

Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound
packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic
superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) into the blood. Superantigens bind to the
MHC-II complex of antigen-presenting cells without processing and nonspecifically activate T
cells. This leads to a dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines, which causes the
manifestations of the disease (eg, hypotension; high fever; organ failure; diffuse, erythematous
rash).
