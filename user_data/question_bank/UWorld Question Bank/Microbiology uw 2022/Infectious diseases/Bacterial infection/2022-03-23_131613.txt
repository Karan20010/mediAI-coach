(Choice B) Latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by the presence of organisms
in walled-off granulomas. Patients with latent tuberculosis are asymptomatic and most will
never have reactivation of disease. Reactivation is classically characterized by the formation
of apical, cavitary lesions in the lung, weight loss, and cough.

(Choice C) Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular organism that invades as a
small elementary body and then evolves to the metabolically active reticulate body once inside
host cells. Recurrent Chlamydia symptoms (eg, dysuria, purulent urethra discharge) in
patients who have been adequately treated (eg, azithromycin) usually indicates a new infection
due to continued high-risk behavior (eg, unprotected sex).

(Choice D) Scabies is a skin mite (Sarcoptes scabie/) that causes intensely pruritic eruptions,
particularly of the finger webs, wrists, axilla, areola, and genitalia. The mite burrows into the

epidermis and lays eggs. Topical treatment with permethrin is usually curative, but recurrence
can occur if close contacts and environmental harbors (eg, sheets) are not adequately treated.

(Choice E) Clostridium difficile spores are hardy and resistant to heat and soap. Infection
usually causes colitis with watery diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Recurrent infection
after treatment with oral antibiotics (eg, vancomycin) is common and may require a repeat
pharmacologic treatment or, in some cases, fecal transplant.
