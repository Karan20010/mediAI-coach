Enterococcal endocarditis (representing up to 30% of nosocomial endocarditis cases)
usually occurs in elderly men who have recently undergone manipulation of areas colonized by
this organism. The genitourinary tract (eg, cystoscopy) is the most common portal of entry;
gastrointestinal (eg, colonoscopy) or obstetric procedures are also risk factors. Enterococci
can also cause urinary tract infections (most common), intraabdominal and pelvic infections,
and wound infections. Enterococci are typically gamma-hemolytic (no hemolysis on agar),
catalase-negative, pyrrolidonyl arylamidase-positive, Lancefield Group D gram-positive
cocci that can grow in hypertonic (6.5%) saline and bile. The most common species of
enterococci (formerly classified under the genus Streptococcus) are Enterococcus faecalis
(80%-90%) and Enterococcus faecium (10%-15%).

Enterococci are resistant to many antibiotics and can be very difficult to treat. A cell wall-active
agent (such as ampicillin) is often combined with an aminoglycoside for synergistic effect, but
increasingly bacteria resistant to both aminoglycosides and B-lactams (including penicillinase-
resistant types) are emerging. Strains with vancomycin or linezolid resistance have also
appeared.

(Choice B) Dental extraction is associated with endocarditis caused by viridans group
streptococci (VGS). In most cases, VGS cause subacute bacterial endocarditis in already
