as E coli into the urinary tract. Other predisposing factors for E coli UTl—particularly in older
women—include diabetes, urinary retention or incontinence, and instrumentation of the urethra

(eg, intermittent catheterization), all of which are present in this patient.

(Choices C and D) Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are gram-negative rods
that can cause UTI, most commonly in patients with indwelling Foley catheters. However, in
contrast to E coli, these organisms are lactose nonfermenters (ie, do not form pink colonies on
MacConkey agar).

(Choice E) Staphylococcus saprophyticus is the second-most frequent cause of UTI after E
coli in young, sexually active women but is less common in the elderly population. Moreover,
staphylococci are gram-positive, and therefore would not grow on MacConkey agar.

Educational objective:
Escherichia coli are lactose-fermenting, indole-positive, gram-negative rods that grow on
MacConkey agar and are the most common pathogen causing urinary tract infection.
