Educational objective:

Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, is transmitted primarily by rodent fleas.
Manifestations include rapid-onset systemic symptoms (eg, high fever, chills, weakness,
headache) and painful, purulent regional lymphadenitis. First-line treatment is with
aminoglycosides, which block bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 30S ribosomal

subunit.
