The removal of RNA primers and their replacement with DNA is accomplished by DNA
polymerase I, the only bacterial DNA polymerase with 5' to 3' exonuclease activity. DNA
polymerase III has 5' to 3' polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease ("proofreading") activity;
however, it cannot remove RNA primers as it lacks 5' to 3' exonuclease activity (Choice B).

Educational objective:

During bacterial DNA replication, DNA polymerase | functions to remove RNA primers (via 5' to
3' exonuclease activity) and replace them with DNA (via 5' to 3' polymerase activity). DNA
polymerase | is the only bacterial DNA polymerase that possesses 5' to 3' exonuclease activity.
