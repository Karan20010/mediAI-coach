Educational objective:

"Hot tub folliculitis" is a superficial and self-limited Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of the
hair follicles that tends to occur in minor outbreaks following exposure to a pool or spa in which
the chemicals have not been maintained at appropriate concentrations. Pseudomonas are
gram-negative, oxidase-positive, nonlactose-fermenting, motile rods that produce green
pigment.
