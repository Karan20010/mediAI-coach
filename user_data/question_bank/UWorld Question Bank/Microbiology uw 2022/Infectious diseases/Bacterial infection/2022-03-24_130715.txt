Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is a potential complication of group A streptococcal
infection (eg, impetigo, pharyngitis). Symptoms include proteinuria (often associated with
periorbital or generalized edema) and hematuria. Acute rheumatic fever is a postinfectious
sequelae of streptococcal pharyngitis only, not impetigo.
