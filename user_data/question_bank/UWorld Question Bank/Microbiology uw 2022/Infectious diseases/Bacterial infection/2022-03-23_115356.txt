Educational objective:

Francisella tularensis is a highly virulent, gram-negative coccobacillus transmitted to humans
during contact with an infected wild animal (eg, hare, rabbit, squirrel) or due to a bite with a tick
or mosquito that recently fed on an infected animal. The most common manifestation is
ulceroglandular disease, which is characterized by rapid-onset fever, a single papuloulcerative
lesion with central eschar at the site of inoculation, and painful regional lymphadenopathy.
