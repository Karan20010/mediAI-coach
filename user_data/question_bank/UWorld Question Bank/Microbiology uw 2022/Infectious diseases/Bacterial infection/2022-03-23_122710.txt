(Choices A, B, and D) Foodborne illness can also be caused by other bacterial mechanisms,
such as:

¢ Enterotoxin production within the intestine by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and
Vibrio cholera, whose toxins cause watery diarrhea, and enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC)
and Shigella, whose toxins cause inflammatory/bloody diarrhea

¢ Bacterial invasion of the intestinal mucosa by Salmonella, enteroinvasive E coli (EIEC),
and Campylobacter jejuni causes inflammatory/bloody diarrhea

¢ Enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC) attaches to enterocytes and effaces their surface,
resulting in watery diarrhea; this strain does not produce toxins

However, gastroenteritis due to these bacteria generally takes >24 hours to manifest, as the
bacteria require time to proliferate and subsequently produce enterotoxin and/or invade the
intestinal epithelium.

(Choice E) Most gram-negative enteric pathogens contain endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) that
is released upon cell lysis. However, endotoxin released in the gastrointestinal tract is not
typically absorbed in sufficient quantities to cause systemic illness. Endotoxin-mediated illness
(eg, sepsis) occurs when gram-negative bacteria are present in the bloodstream.
