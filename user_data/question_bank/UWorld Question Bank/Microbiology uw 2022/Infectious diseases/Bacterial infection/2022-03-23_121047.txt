This patient likely has Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis (which may occur in patients
who are unvaccinated or immunocompromised). Haemophilus (from the Greek for blood-
loving) requires both X factor (hematin) and V factor (NAD+) to support growth. Sheep blood
agar does not allow Haemophilus growth due to insufficient nutrients and the V factor-
inactivating enzymes in the medium.

Growth of Haemophilus species on sheep blood agar can be achieved by cross-streaking the
medium with Staphylococcus aureus. H influenzae colonies will grow around the streaks of B-
hemolytic S aureus colonies because the latter actively secrete V factor (NAD+) into the
medium and facilitate release of additional X factor (hematin) from B-hemolysis-induced
erythrocyte lysis. This is known as the "satellite" phenomenon.
