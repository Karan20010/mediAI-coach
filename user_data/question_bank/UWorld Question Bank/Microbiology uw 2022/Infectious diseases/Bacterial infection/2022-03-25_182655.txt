Educational objective:

The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an acute inflammatory reaction that occurs within hours of
treatment for spirochetal infections (eg, syphilis). The rapid lysis of spirochetes releases
inflammatory bacterial lipoproteins into the circulation and causes acute fever, rigors, and
myalgias.
