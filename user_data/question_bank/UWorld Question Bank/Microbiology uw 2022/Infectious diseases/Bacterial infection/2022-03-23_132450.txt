mucus are often seen (rice-water stool) due to the activation of goblet cells. Aggressive fluid
resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy.

(Choice A) Charcot-Leyden crystals (from eosinophil breakdown) in the stool are sometimes
seen in intestinal parasitic infections. Diarrhea with peripheral eosinophilia can be seen with
Strongyloides, Ancylostoma, Ascaris, Toxocara, and Trichinella (but not with Giardia or
Entamoeba).

(Choice B) The presence of leukocytes with monocytic predominance is typical for typhoid
fever caused by Salmonella Typhi.

(Choices C and D) Invading bacteria that cause dysentery or inflammatory diarrhea (eg,
Shigella species, Salmonella species, Campylobacter jejuni, enteroinvasive E coli [EIEC]) are
usually marked by leukocytes with neutrophilic predominance and erythrocytes. A
hemorrhagic organism (eg, enterohemorrhagic E coli 0157:H7, which causes toxin-mediated
enterocyte death and intestinal hemorrhage without mucosal invasion) would be characterized
by erythrocytes without leukocytes.

Educational objective:
Vibrio cholerae and id enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli cause a purely toxin-mediated watery
