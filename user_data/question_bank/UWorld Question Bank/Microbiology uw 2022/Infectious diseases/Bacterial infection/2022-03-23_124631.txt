This patient's chronic cough, weight loss, cervical lymphadenopathy, and cavitary pulmonary
lesion suggest active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Exposure to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis usually results in lifelong latent infection due to the formation of granulomas,
which wall off the pathogen and limit spread. However, the formation and maintenance of
granulomas rely on coordination between monocytes and T lymphocytes. Host conditions
that weaken these aspects of immune function often significantly increase the risk of
reactivation TB; these include the following:

¢ Chronic kidney disease is associated with impaired function of monocytes and the cell-
mediated immune response due to uremia and hypoalbuminemia. Risk of TB is increased
6- to 50-fold in this population and is greatest in those with end-stage disease.

¢ Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is associated with immune impairment and
alterations to cytokine signaling, which weaken the development and maintenance of
granulomas. Risk of TB is greatest in those with chronic hyperglycemia (eg, this patient
with hemoglobin A1c of 8.5%).

Increased risk of reactivation TB is also seen in those with immunosuppression (eg, HIV,
immunomodulatory/glucocorticoid medications), substance abuse, malnutrition, and advanced
age.
