Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an exotoxin-mediated disease associated
with rapid-onset high fever, hypotension, multiorgan failure, and a diffuse, erythematous rash.
Most cases are linked to prolonged tampon use or nasal wound packing, which provides a
medium for localized Staphylococcus aureus proliferation and the elaboration of pyrogenic
toxin superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 [TSST-1]) into the bloodstream.

Pyrogenic toxin superantigens are generated by strains of S aureus (and Streptococcus
pyogenes) that have acquired an underlying mobile genetic element via bacteriophage or
plasmid. These exotoxins are called superantigens because they bind to the invariant region
of the MHC-II complex of antigen-presenting cells without first being internalized and
processed (MHC-II antigens are normally processed by the phagolysosome) (Choice E). The
superantigen/MHC-II complex subsequently interacts with the variable part of the T-cell
receptor beta chain, which results in the nonspecific stimulation of a large percentage
(>20%) of total T cells and the massive release of inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-2, TNF-
alpha & beta, interferon-gamma). Cytokine release mediates the major manifestations of TSS
including fever, increased capillary permeability, and hypotension.
