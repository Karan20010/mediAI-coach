Inhalation of spores into the alveoli causes pulmonary anthrax. Alveolar macrophages
phagocytose the spores and bring them to mediastinal lymph nodes, where the spores
germinate into vegetative rods and multiply. The vegetative form of the bacteria contains a
polypeptide capsule composed of D-glutamic acid, which is antiphagocytic. B anthracis
rods also produce a potent exotoxin complex composed of edema factor, lethal factor, and
protective antigen, which enter host cells and cause cell death.

Initial manifestations of infection are nonspecific (eg, myalgia, fever, malaise), but proliferation
of the bacteria in the mediastinum eventually causes hemorrhagic mediastinitis (often visible
on chest x-ray as a widened mediastinum). Subsequent dissemination through the
bloodstream causes shock, brain edema/hemorrhage, and death. Although pulmonary anthrax
is quite rare, it can be seen in individuals who handle contaminated hides or animal hair
("woolsorter's disease") or those exposed to aerosolized biologic weapons (eg, opening
contaminated mail).
