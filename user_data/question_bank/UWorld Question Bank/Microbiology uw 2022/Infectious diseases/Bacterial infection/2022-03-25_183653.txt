Cytotoxic chemotherapy induces apoptosis in dividing cells by impairing mitosis or inducing
DNA damage. These medications are administered at the highest tolerable dose so that
maximal effect can be achieved. However, the effects are not selective; all cell lines with
high turnover rates are impacted, including tumor, hair follicle, bone marrow, and
gastrointestinal (Gl) epithelial cells.
