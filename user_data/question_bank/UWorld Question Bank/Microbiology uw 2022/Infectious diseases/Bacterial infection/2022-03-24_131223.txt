the airway, leading to bronchiectasis and respiratory decline.

(Choice A) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to
Aspergillus fumigatus that primarily manifests with asthma-like symptoms. Although ABPA can
occur in patients with CF, it is far less common than Pseudomonas lower respiratory infections.

(Choice B) Moraxella catarrhalis is an upper respiratory pathogen that frequently causes otitis
media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and laryngitis. Although this organism is a common cause of
exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it is not a frequent colonizer of
patients with CF.

(Choice C) Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections can cause coughing for several weeks or
months and, occasionally, hemoptysis. However, thick sputum production is uncommon. In
addition, chest x-ray typically reveals cavitary lesions in the upper lobes.

(Choice E) Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of community-acquired
pneumonia and a frequent underlying pathogen in sinusitis, bronchitis, and otitis media. It is
not a typical cause of persistent infection in patients with CF.

Educational objective:
In patients with cystic fibrosis, pathogenic bacteria colonize the respiratory tract early in the
