This patient has a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUT]), and the antibiotic
resistance pattern (ie, extended-spectrum, beta-lactamaseâ€”producing Escherichia coll)
suggests a nosocomial source. CAUTI is most commonly due to the formation of a bacterial
biofilm on the catheter surface or retrograde passage of bacteria via the catheter lumen.

The duration of catheterization is the single most important risk factor for CAUTI. Placement
of a catheter for >48 hours (when biofilm formation is most likely to occur) significantly
increases CAUTI risk. Prevention includes avoiding inappropriate catheterization (eg,
incontinence alone is an inappropriate indication for indwelling catheter placement) and
promptly removing the catheter when it is no longer needed (eg, immediately following
surgery).
