- expected to be elevated.
6 (Choice A) B-type natriuretic peptide is secreted by the ventricles in response to elevated

: failure often have elevated jugular venous pressure and lower extremity edema, pulmonary
10 examination findings are usually bilateral, and fevers and leukocytosis would not be expected.

= be decreased in this acutely ill patient. Prealbumin levels are also decreased in cases of

Educational objective:
Acute phase reactants (APRs) are proteins whose serum concentrations change by 225%
during periods of inflammation Procalcitonin is 4a unique APR that can rise or fall depending
