Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus [GBS]) is often a normal commensal of the
genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts of pregnant women. Those who are colonized and do
not receive intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis can transmit the bacteria to the fetus during
passage through the vaginal canal, leading to neonatal sepsis (eg, irritability, lethargy,
grunting, tachypnea, temperature instability, hypotension) within hours of birth.

GBS is a leading cause of early neonatal sepsis and can be identified by the following
laboratory features:

¢ Narrow zone of beta-hemolysis (clear) when plated on blood agar.

¢ Production of CAMP factor, a phospholipase that enhances the activity of beta-
hemolysins secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Testing for CAMP factor
(CAMP test) can confirm the presence of GBS; this test plates suspected GBS colonies
perpendicular to an appropriate S aureus strain and evaluates for enhanced areas of
hemolysis (arrow-shaped zones in the image above).

GBS is also catalase-negative (as are all streptococci), contains the Lancefield group B
antigen in its cell wall, and hydrolyzes hippurate.
