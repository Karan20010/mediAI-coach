Educational objective:

Chancroid, due to Haemophilus ducreyi, presents as deep, painful (you "do cry" with H
ducreyi) ulcers with ragged borders that are associated with a grey exudate and inguinal
lymphadenopathy. Diagnosis is established by Gram stain and culture of the organism from a

scraping of the ulcer base.
