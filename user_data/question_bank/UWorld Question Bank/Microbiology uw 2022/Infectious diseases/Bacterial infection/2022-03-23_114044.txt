Educational objective:

Toxigenic strains of Corynebacterium diphtheriae produce diphtheria toxin, which irreversibly
inhibits host protein synthesis due to ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2. Local effects
include pseudomembranous pharyngitis; systemic effects include potentially life-threatening
myocarditis and neuritis. Immunization with diphtheria toxoid generates protective circulating
IgG against the exotoxin B subunit.
