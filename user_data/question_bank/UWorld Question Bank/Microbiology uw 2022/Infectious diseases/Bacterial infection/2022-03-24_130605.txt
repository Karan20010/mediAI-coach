The main classes of antifungal medications currently in use include:

1. Polyenes (eg, amphotericin B, nystatin): Bind to ergosterol molecules in fungal cell
membranes, creating pores and causing cell lysis

2. Triazoles (eg, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole): Inhibit the synthesis
of ergosterol

3. Echinocandins (eg, caspofungin, micafungin): Inhibit the synthesis of glucan, a
component of the fungal cell wall

4. Pyrimidines: Flucytosine, the only agent in this class of antifungals, is converted to 5-
fluorouracil within the fungal cell and interferes with fungal RNA and protein synthesis.

Of these agents, only the polyenes (amphotericin B, nystatin) depend on the amount of
ergosterol incorporated into fungal cell membranes for their efficacy. These drugs bind to
ergosterol molecules, forming pores in the membrane and allowing leakage of ions (especially
K-) from the cells. This disruption of cell membrane integrity leads to cell lysis. An organism
that decreases the amount of ergosterol in its cell membrane would likely become resistant to
polyenes. Amphotericin B is a systemic antifungal active against Candida, Aspergillus,
Cryptococcus, Histoplasma, Blastomyces, and Coccidioides. Nystatin is used topically; oral
candidiasis is the main indication for its use ("swish and swallow").
