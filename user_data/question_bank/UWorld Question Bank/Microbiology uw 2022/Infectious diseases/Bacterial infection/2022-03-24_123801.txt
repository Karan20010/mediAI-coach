The elimination of intracellular pathogens is largely reliant on the cell-mediated immune
response as bacteria within cells are protected from circulating immune factors (eg,
antibodies, complement). Cells infected by intracellular bacteria display bacterial protein
fragments on their surface, which triggers cell lysis by cytotoxic T cells. This releases the
organism from the protected intracellular space and exposes it to phagocytosis by
macrophages. Although intracellular pathogens can often replicate within inactivated
macrophages due to virulence factors that prevent phagolysosome destruction, cytotoxic T-
cells release interferon gamma to activate macrophages leading to the formation of fully
mature (acidified) phagolysosomes capable of destroying the bacteria.

As the elimination of Listeria is reliant on the cell mediated immune response, patients with
impaired cell-mediated immunity are at greatest risk for invasive Listeria infections (eg,
sepsis, meningitis), particularly those at the extremes of age (ie, neonates, elderly) or patients
who are immunosuppressed (eg, Hodgkin disease, AIDS) or pregnant.
