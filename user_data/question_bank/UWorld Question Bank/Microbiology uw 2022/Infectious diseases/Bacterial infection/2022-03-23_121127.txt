A 6-year-old, previously healthy girl is brought to the emergency department due to fever,
abdominal pain, and diarrhea for the past day. The symptoms began abruptly with high fever,
as well as cramping periumbilical pain, and were quickly followed by low-volume diarrhea
mixed with blood and mucus. The patient has had no sick contacts and has not traveled
recently; the family had dinner at a buffet restaurant 3 days ago. Temperature is 38.9 C (102
F). Physical examination reveals mild, diffuse abdominal tenderness with no guarding or
rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. Stool occult blood testing is positive,
with numerous leukocytes in the stool. Culture of stool yields gram-negative, oxidase-positive,
curved rods. Which of the following is the most likely pathogen responsible for this patient's
symptoms?

SY _ A. Campylobacter jejuni (74%)
B. Escherichia coli (4%)
