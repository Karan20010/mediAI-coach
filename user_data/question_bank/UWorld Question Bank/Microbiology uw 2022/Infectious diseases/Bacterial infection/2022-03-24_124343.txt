Educational objective:

Bubonic plague causes a febrile illness with regional inflammatory lymphadenopathy

(buboes). The underlying pathogen is Yersinia pestis, a small gram-negative
bacillus/coccobacillus that exhibits bipolar staining (resembling a closed safety pin). The major
environmental reservoir is rodents; transmission usually occurs via rodent fleabite.
