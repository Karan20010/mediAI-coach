(Choice A) A tall body habitus is often seen in Marfan syndrome. Although these individuals
have an increased risk of spontaneous pneumothorax, manifestations would include acute
shortness of breath and imaging evidence of air between the lung and chest wall.

(Choice B) Patients who work with hot tubs and swimming pools can develop hypersensitivity
pneumonitis due to inhalation of Mycobacterium avium, a nontuberculous mycobacterium.
Although most cases are marked by acute dyspnea, chronic symptoms can occur. However,
imaging would generally show patchy, ground-glass pulmonary infiltrates, not a cavitary lesion.

(Choice C) Living with pets increases the risk of asthma due to increased exposure to
allergens. Asthma is typically marked by recurrent bronchoconstriction with acute periods of
dyspnea, wheeze, and cough. Chest x-ray may show hyperinflation and bronchial thickening
but not cavitary infiltration.

(Choice D) Travel to areas endemic for TB can increase risk of exposure and subsequent
infection. Endemic regions include India, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia. Denmark
has a low incidence of TB; it is unlikely that the patient acquired the infection during his visit to
this country.
