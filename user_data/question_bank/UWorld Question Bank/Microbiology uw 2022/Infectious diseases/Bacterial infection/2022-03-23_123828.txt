Staphylococcus epidermidis, a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species and a component
of normal skin flora, is one of the most common causes of infections associated with foreign
bodies (including ventriculoperitoneal shunts). S epidermidis is adept at causing foreign body
infections because of its ability to form biofilms.

Once introduced into the body, foreign bodies quickly become coated with a layer of host
proteins, including fibrinogen and fibronectin. These proteins then serve as binding sites for S
epidermidis. After attachment occurs, the bacteria multiply and communicate with one another
to induce synthesis of an extracellular polysaccharide matrix that encases the bacteria. The
resulting biofilm functions as a barrier to antibiotic penetration and interferes with host
defenses, including opsonization, neutrophil migration, and even T lymphocyte activation.
Once mature, these biofilms can disperse individual pathogen “seeds” (planktonic cells) into
the bloodstream and surrounding areas, further disseminating the infection. Definitive
treatment of infections caused by biofilm-producing organisms often requires removal of the

foreign body.
