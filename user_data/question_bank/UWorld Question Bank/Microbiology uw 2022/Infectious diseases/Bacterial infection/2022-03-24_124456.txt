Bordetella pertussis, a gram-negative coccobacillus, most commonly infects
unvaccinated/undervaccinated infants and children. The bacterium is largely noninvasive and
secretes several exotoxins that damage ciliated respiratory epithelium. Symptoms include a
mild cough and rhinorrhea followed by severe, paroxysmal cough that may be associated with

an inspiratory whoop and vomiting.
