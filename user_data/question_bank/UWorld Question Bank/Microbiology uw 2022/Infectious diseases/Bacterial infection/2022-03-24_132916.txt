to bind to and inactivate the penicillin binding proteins of Listeria.

(Choice A) Although many Haemophilus influenzae organisms produce beta lactamases, they
are effectively treated with a beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitor (eg, amoxicillin/clavulanate)
or with third-generation cephalosporins.

(Choice C) Neisseria meningitidis is effectively treated with third-generation cephalosporins.

(Choice D) Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) is universally susceptible to
ampicillin or penicillin as well as third-generation cephalosporins.

(Choice E) Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of meningitis in older
infants and children. Although this organism has increasing penicillin and cephalosporin
resistance, vancomycin provides effective coverage (and would result in symptomatic
improvement).

Educational objective:

Ampicillin is the treatment of choice for Listeria, which is not sensitive to cephalosporins.
Listeria most commonly causes disease in those with deficient cell-mediated immunity, such
as young infants or immunocompromised patients.
