Group A streptococcus (GAS), also called Streptococcus pyogenes, is the leading cause of
bacterial pharyngitis in children and adolescents. Manifestations include abrupt-onset
fever and sore throat; patients may also have nausea, vomiting, and headache. Examination
often reveals exudative tonsillopharyngitis and enlarged tonsils. An alternate diagnosis should
be suspected in those with manifestations of viral illness (eg, coryza, conjunctivitis, cough,
hoarseness, mouth ulcers).
