Educational objective:

Intracellular bacterial organisms such as Legionella pneumophila are primarily countered by
the cell-mediated immune response. Intracellular pathogens that replicate within phagosomes
(eg, Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis) trigger activation and differentiation of T-helper
subtype 1 cells with subsequent macrophage activation via interferon-gamma.
