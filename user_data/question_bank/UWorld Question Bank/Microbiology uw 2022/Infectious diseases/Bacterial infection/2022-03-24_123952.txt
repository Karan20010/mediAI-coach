(Choice A) Contact between Entamoeba histolytica and the host cell results in insertion of an
amebic channel-forming protein in the host cell membrane, causing cell death. Symptoms
include bloody diarrhea and/or extraintestinal manifestations (eg, liver abscess). Rash is
uncommon, and blood cultures would not show gram-negative rods.

(Choice B) Campylobacter infection causes acute, self-limited diarrhea (<7 days) and may
result in cross-reacting antibodies to ganglioside G,,,, leading to Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome.

Rose spots, hepatosplenomegaly, and pulse-temperature dissociation would not be expected.

(Choice D) Rotavirus and Giardia damage intestinal villi, leading to intestinal malabsorption
due to villous blunting and decreased levels of brush border enzymes (eg, maltase, lactase).
