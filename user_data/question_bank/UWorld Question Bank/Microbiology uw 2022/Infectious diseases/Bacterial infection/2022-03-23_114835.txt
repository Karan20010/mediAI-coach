Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative bacterium transmitted
through sexual contact. It presents as one or more deep, painful ulcers (you "do cry" with H
ducreyi) with ragged borders that are associated with a grey exudate and inguinal
lymphadenopathy. On Gram stain, the organism appears as curved, gram-negative rods,
often in a clumping pattern. The disease is relatively uncommon in the United States but has
much higher prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and regions of Asia.
