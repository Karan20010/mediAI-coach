Educational objective:

Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli cause a purely toxin-mediated watery
diarrhea. The toxins secreted by these organisms modify electrolyte handling by enterocytes
but do not cause cell death; therefore, no erythrocytes or leukocytes are typically noted on

stool microscopy.
