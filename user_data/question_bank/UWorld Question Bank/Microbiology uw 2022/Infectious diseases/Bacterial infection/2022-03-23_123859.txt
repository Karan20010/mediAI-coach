= risk of infection from these organisms.

= (Choice C) Protein A is a surface protein found on the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus that
27 binds to the Fc region of immunoglobulins. S aureus uses Protein A to inhibit opsonization and
* phagocytic engulfment.

Â° (Choice D) Exotoxin production is not a known pathogenic mechanism of S epidermidis.
