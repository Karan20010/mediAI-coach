(Choice A) Babesia is a protozoa transmitted by ticks in the northeastern and midwestern
United States. It appears as a ring-shaped, intraerythrocytic parasite (similar to Plasmodium).

(Choice B) Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease and is transmitted by ticks (eg, Ixodes
scapularis). Initial infection usually causes nonspecific symptoms (eg, fatigue, headache,
myalgia) and a spreading, annular rash called erythema migrans. However, B burgdorferi is
not typically visualized on microscopy and does not replicate in membrane-bound inclusions.

(Choice D) Francisella tularensis is an aerobic, gram-negative bacterium that is transmitted
when humans come into contact with infected animals (eg, rabbits). It causes tularemia, which
is typically characterized by tender, regional lymphadenopathy and a single, papulo-ulcerative
lesion with eschar. This pathogen does not grow within membrane-bound vacuoles within
leukocytes.

(Choice E) Rickettsia rickettsii is a tick-borne, gram-negative, obligate, intracellular bacterium
that attacks vascular endothelial cells and causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Patients
typically develop nonspecific symptoms (eg, fever, headache, myalgia) followed by a
blanching, erythematous, centripetal rash that begins on the ankles and wrists.
