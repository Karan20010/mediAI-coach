The low ID;, of Shigella is related to virulence factors expressed in various locations in the

gastrointestinal tract:

¢ Stomach: Shigella can survive a low-pH environment, the primary reason for its low
ID. On exposure to acidic conditions, Shigella species upregulate the transcription of pH-
resistant virulence genes, making them relatively resistant to degradation in the
stomach. This characteristic is in contrast to the acid-sensitivity of Salmonella, which
contributes to its higher ID...

¢ Proximal small intestine: Bile salts are normally bactericidal, but exposure to them
upregulates production of adhesin proteins and promotes formation of Shigella biofilms.

¢ Distal small intestine: Shigella invades cells forming the epithelial barrier and can spread
to other cells laterally (ie, cell-to-cell spread) without reentering the gut lumen.

Other organisms that can cause diarrhea with a small inoculum include Campylobacter jejuni
(500 organisms), Entamoeba histolytica (1-10), and Giardia lamblia (1-10).
