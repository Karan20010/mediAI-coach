Educational objective:

Staphylococcal foodborne illness is due to the consumption of a preformed enterotoxin in
contaminated food. Most cases can be prevented by washing hands thoroughly prior to food
preparation (prevents contamination) and ensuring proper refrigerated storage (prevents
bacterial proliferation/enterotoxin production).
