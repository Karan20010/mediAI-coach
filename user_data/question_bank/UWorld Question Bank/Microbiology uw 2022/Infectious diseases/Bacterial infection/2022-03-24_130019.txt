This patient with diarrhea has stool cultures growing gram-negative bacilli that are nonlactose
fermenting and oxidase negative, findings consistent with nontyphoidal Salmonella
gastroenteritis. Transmission typically occurs via consumption of contaminated poultry
products (eg, chicken salad), including eggs.

Ingested Sa/monella must survive the acidic environment of the stomach prior to traveling to
the small intestine to cause disease. Therefore, patients on acid suppression (eg, proton
pump inhibitors) require smaller infectious doses and are at greater risk. Once in the small
intestine, the organism penetrates enterocytes and elicits a profound inflammatory response,
which is typically limited to the gastrointestinal tract.

Symptoms (eg, fever, diarrhea) usually resolve within days in healthy, immunocompetent
patients; however, invasive disease is more likely in patients at extremes of age and in those
with impaired immunity (eg, AIDS, tumor necrosis factorâ€”alpha inhibitor). Rather than
confinement within the small intestine, bacteria can spread through the bloodstream and
reticuloendothelial system (similar to typhoidal Sa/monella). Sites of extraintestinal
nontyphoidal Salmonella infection include the vasculature (mycotic aneurysm), heart
(endocarditis), and bone. Osteomyelitis usually develops at sites of prior bone
injury/prosthesis; it also occurs more commonly in patients with sickle cell disease.
