A 43-year-old immigrant from Southern Asia suffers from a cough that has lasted for several
months duration. He comes to the clinic today because of recent onset hemoptysis. On
further evaluation, he reports a 15-Ib weight loss over the past four months. Sputum cultures
grow acid-fast bacilli that are susceptible to most antimycobacterial drugs in vitro. Isoniazid
monotherapy in this patient would most likely result in:

A. Bacteriocidal effect on only extracellular bacilli (16%)

B. Decreased transport protein expression on the cell surface (10%)
C. B-lactamase induction within bacterial cells (1%)

D. Rapid mycobacterial elimination from the body (8%)

JY E. Selective survival of bacterial cells secondary to gene mutation (62%)
