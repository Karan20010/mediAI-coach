Acute phase reactants (APRs) are proteins whose serum concentrations change by 225%
during periods of inflammation. Procalcitonin is a unique APR that can rise or fall depending
on the etiology of the infection; elevated levels correlate with a bacterial source, whereas low
levels indicate a viral source.
