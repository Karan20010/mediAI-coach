The most frequent CNS tumor in immunosuppressed patients is a primary CNS lymphoma.
This CNS tumor is commonly associated with AIDS.

Primary CNS lymphomas appear microscopically as dense, cellular aggregates of uniform,
atypical lymphoid cells. The majority of primary CNS lymphomas arise from B-cells. Diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype. The cells of CNS lymphomas are
commonly positive for the B-cell markers CD20 and CD79a.

Primary CNS lymphomas are universally associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The
clinical presentation is non-specific. Mental status changes, seizures, or progressive focal
neurologic deficits may occur. Most of CNS lymphomas are high-grade and respond poorly to
chemotherapy.
