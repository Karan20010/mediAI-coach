Congenital syphilis is acquired via transplacental transmission of the spirochete Treponema
pallidum and may present with pain and limited extremity movement due to long bone
involvement (eg, metaphyseal erosions, periosteal inflammation). Nonspecific manifestations
include hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
