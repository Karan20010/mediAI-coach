of the vaccine.

Educational objective:

Initial vaccination generates an early IgM response by short-lived plasma cells followed by a
delayed-onset, longer-lasting IgG response due to T-cell dependent class switching (IgM
peaks before IgG). Due to formation of memory B cells, secondary responses (eg, booster
vaccination, pathogen exposure) are characterized by a rapid and sustained IgG response

with a short-term, more muted IgM response.
