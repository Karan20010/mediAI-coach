*Genes specific to toxigenic strains are assessed.
EIA = enzyme immunoassay; IV = intravenous; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; PPI = proton
pump inhibitor.

Treatment options for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) typically include oral fidaxomicin
or oral vancomycin. Fidaxomicin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits the RNA polymerase
sigma subunit, the component involved in binding promoter DNA so that transcription can be
initiated. Inhibition of transcription leads to impaired protein synthesis and eventual cell death
(bactericidal activity against C difficile).

Fidaxomicin is administered orally and has minimal systemic absorption, resulting in high
concentrations in the colon and feces. It also has a narrow spectrum of activity, with a lesser
effect on normal colonic flora than vancomycin.
