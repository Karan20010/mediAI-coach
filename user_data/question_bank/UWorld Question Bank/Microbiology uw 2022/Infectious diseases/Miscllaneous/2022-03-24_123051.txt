This infant with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy has multifocal bony erosions,
findings worrisome for congenital syphilis. This infection is acquired via transplacental
transmission of the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Although routine first-trimester
screening and treatment when indicated help decrease the risk of in utero transmission, lack
of prenatal care increases the risk of fetal transmission.

Classic neonatal findings include copious rhinorrhea and a maculopapular rash involving the
palms and soles; however, skeletal abnormalities due to spread of T pallidum to the bone
may be the primary reason for evaluation. Typical signs and symptoms include the following:

¢ Bilateral and symmetric metaphyseal erosions and periosteal inflammation of long bones
¢ Pathologic fractures
¢ Swelling, pain, and limited movement of affected extremities

Nonspecific findings in congenital syphilis include fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and

lymphadenopathy. Pancytopenia can also occur, and anemia is the most likely cause of this
patient's pallor.
