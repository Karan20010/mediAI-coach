3 (Choice A) The rash of erythema multiforme often involves the palms and soles and may be
precipitated by an infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) associated with fever, as well as
enlargement of the lymph nodes, liver, and spleen. However, the rash is characterized by
target lesions with a dusky center, findings not seen in this patient.

(Choice B) Kawasaki disease, which is exceedingly rare in neonates, can present with a
desquamating rash involving the hands and feet. However, other diagnostic criteria include
fever 25 days, a cervical node >1.5 cm, conjunctivitis, and mucositis, none of which are seen
in this patient. In addition, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are
inconsistent with this diagnosis.

(Choice C) Measles initially presents with a prodrome of fever and rhinorrhea but also
conjunctivitis and cough, findings not seen in this patient. The subsequent rash spreads
cephalocaudally and typically spares the palms and soles, making this diagnosis unlikely in
this patient.

(Choice D) Scarlet fever due to group A Streptococcus causes pharyngitis with a diffuse, fine,
rough (sandpaper) rash that spares the palms and soles, unlike in this patient.
Reticuloendothelial involvement (ie, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly) is not
seen.
