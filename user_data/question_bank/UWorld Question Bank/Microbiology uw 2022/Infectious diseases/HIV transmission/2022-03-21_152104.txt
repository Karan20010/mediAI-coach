(Choice A) Antigenic mimicry is the sharing of antigenic sequences between the
microorganism and the host cell, facilitating immune evasion. The gonococcal
lipooligosaccharide is similar in structure to human cell membrane glycosphingolipids.
However, this is not related to antibody formation against the pilus. Antigenic mimicry can lead
to autoimmune disease if the host mounts an immune response against the infectious epitope
and that epitope has sufficient sequence homology with a host antigen.

(Choice C) Plasmid conjugation plays an important role in gonococcal antibiotic resistance.

(Choice D) Pilin proteins do not represent a low molecular weight structure that would be
poorly immunogenic.

(Choice E) Gonococcal pili are protein polymers. In addition, vaccines have been developed
against non-protein structures (eg, meningococcal vaccine, pneumococcal vaccine).
