A scientist is conducting research to discover novel drug targets for antiretroviral agents
against HIV. An HIV-positive blood sample is analyzed in the laboratory, and purified CD4 T
lymphocytes are extracted. Using molecular tracing techniques, the scientist follows a viral
HIV protein that is synthesized in the blood sample's T cells. The protein becomes
glycosylated before being proteolytically cleaved into 2 smaller proteins in the Golgi
apparatus. Which of the following best describes the function of these 2 newly formed HIV
proteins?

A. Viral DNA integration into the host genome (10%)
B. Viral DNA synthesis from RNA template (12%)
C. Viral polyprotein cleavage (12%)

YD. Virion attachment to the target cells (61%)

E. Virus-induced cell apoptosis (3%)
