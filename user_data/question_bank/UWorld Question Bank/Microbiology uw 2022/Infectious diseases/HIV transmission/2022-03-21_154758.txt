Acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with the shedding of viral antigens
(HBsAg, HBeAg) and HBV DNA into the bloodstream and the development of IgM antibodies
against HBc. Patients are often asymptomatic, but a minority develops constitutional
symptoms (eg, fatigue, loss of appetite), hepatomegaly, icterus, and significant elevations in
aminotransferase levels. Transmission in low-prevalence countries (eg, United States) is
usually due to injection drug use or unprotected sex.

HBV is an encapsulated virus with a partially double-stranded DNA genome. It binds to and
enters hepatocytes using a host cell bile salt transporter and then sheds its coat in the host
cytoplasm. The partially double-stranded genome is "repaired" and transcribed by host cell
machinery, yielding a + sense single-stranded mRNA template. This serves as a pre-
genome for future progeny; it is converted by viral reverse transcriptase into the partially
double-stranded DNA genome of budding viral particles (which are subsequently released
from the cell). The mRNA template is also translated by host ribosomes into the proteins that
compose the virus.
