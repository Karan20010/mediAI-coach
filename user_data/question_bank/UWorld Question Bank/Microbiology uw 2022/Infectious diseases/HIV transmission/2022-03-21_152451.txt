Primary herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection is characterized by the
gingivostomatitis (vesicles on the lips and hard palate, fever, lymphadenopathy) seen in this
young patient. Recurrent HSV-1 infection causes lip lesions that are typically less severe due
to existing cellular and humoral immunity from prior infection.

HSV-1 and other herpesviruses are enveloped and possess double-stranded DNA
genomes. Transmission is usually by direct contact with infected oral secretions or lesions.
Inoculation occurs on mucosa or skin where the virus replicates rapidly in the host cell nucleus
and causes abnormal cell division, resulting in intranuclear inclusion bodies and
multinucleated giant cells visible on Tzanck smear. The vesicular lesions result from cell
lysis and necrosis as well as tissue destruction, inflammation, and fluid accumulation between
the dermis and epidermis.
