Educational objective:

In the HIV replication cycle, polyprotein precursors are encoded by the structural genes gag,
pol, and env. Only the env gene polyprotein product (gp160) is glycosylated. This polyprotein
is subsequently cleaved in the Golgi apparatus to form the envelope glycoproteins gp120 and

gp41.
