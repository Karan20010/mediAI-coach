(Choice A) HIV-associated nephropathy is due to viral infection of kidney epithelial cells and
typically manifests with hematuria, hypertension, and edema. Biopsy classically shows focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis and significant interstitial inflammation.

(Choice B) Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is most common in black patients who have
markedly elevated blood pressure. It usually is characterized by proteinuria with or without
renal insufficiency. Biopsy typically reveals damage to the renal vasculature (eg, intimal
thickening, luminal narrowing), glomeruli (eg, glomerulosclerosis), and renal interstitium (eg,
fibrosis, atrophy).

(Choice C) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is an immune complex disease of the
glomeruli caused by a preceding infection with a nephritogenic strain of group A beta-hemolytic
streptococcus. Patients may have proteinuria, edema, hypertension, and/or acute kidney
injury. However, they usually also have red/brown urine and biopsy evidence of diffuse
proliferative glomerulonephritis.

(Choice E) Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is often used in patients with advanced AIDS to

prevent Pneumocystis pneumonia and/or Toxoplasma gondii. \t can cause interstitial nephritis
and acute kidney injury but does not usually cause focal damage to the proximal tubule.
