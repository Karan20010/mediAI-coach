(Choice A) Most of the proteins necessary for HIV replication are translated into a polyprotein
precursor that is then cleaved into individual proteins by viral and cellular protease enzymes.
The action of viral protease can be directly prevented by protease inhibitors such as

EE saquinavir.

10 (Choice B) Complementary DNA synthesis from the HIV RNA template is directly impaired by
= nucleoside and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

8 (Choice C) Drugs that bind to gp41, HIV's transmembrane envelope protein, are known as

14

15 fusion inhibitors (eg, enfuvirtide). These drugs prevent gp41 from undergoing the

conformational changes necessary for viral membrane fusion with the host cell membrane.

(Choice E) For HIV to infect a cell, the envelope glycoprotein gp120 must bind to both a CD4
molecule and a chemokine receptor (eg, CXKCR4 or CCR5). CCR5 antagonists, such as
maraviroc, exert their antiviral activity against HIV by blocking attachment and entry of CCR5-
tropic viruses into CD4+ T cells and macrophages.

Educational objective:
Integration of double-stranded HIV DNA into the host cell's chromosomes is necessary to
induce viral gene expression and prevent degradation of the viral genome. Raltegravir is an

integrase inhibitor that disrupts HIV genome integration, preventing synthesis of viral MRNA.
