HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is converted into cDNA by the HIV enzyme reverse
transcriptase. This enzyme grows DNA by adding nucleotides to the terminal 3’-hydroxyl
group using a 3-5’ phosphodiester bond. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NRTIs) such as zidovudine block this step in viral replication. This class of medications is
composed of nucleoside/nucleotide analogues that do not have a 3’-hydroxyl group. When
reverse transcriptase incorporates an NRTI into a growing DNA strand, it results in chain
termination because no 3'-hydroxyl group is available to add additional base pairs.

Zidovudine (ZDT) was the first approved HIV medication but is now used primarily to prevent
maternal to fetal transmission of HIV during labor and delivery. It is a thymidine analogue that
contains an azido group in place of the hydroxyl group usually found at the 3’ end of thymidine.
