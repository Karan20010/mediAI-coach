was quickly followed by pain in the right ankle and left wrist. She has no prior medical
problems and takes no medications. Temperature is 38 C (100.4 F), blood pressure is 124/82
mm Hg, and pulse is 90/min. The extremity joints are not erythematous or swollen, but
tenderness is present along the tendons of the left wrist and right ankle. Several small,
