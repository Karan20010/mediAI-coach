Patients with HIV have progressive impairment of the cell-mediated immune response that
puts them at risk for opportunistic infections (Ols) with bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal
pathogens. Ols are associated with significant morbidity and mortality and also worsen HIV
progression and viremia. Antimicrobial prophylaxis can decrease the risk of developing
certain Ols and is recommended in addition to antiretroviral therapy for all patients with HIV
who have CD4 counts <200/mm:.

Antimicrobial prophylaxis is guided by the patient's CD4 count, as follows:

¢ CD4 count <200/mm: — Antimicrobial prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci

pneumonia is indicated. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the first-line agent.

¢ CD4 count <100/mm: — Patients require antimicrobial prophylaxis against Toxoplasma
gondii reactivation if they have serologic evidence of previous exposure (positive
Toxoplasma |gG antibody). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also used for prophylaxis
against this condition (Choice F).

¢ CD4 count <50/mm: — Patients require antimicrobial prophylaxis against Mycobacterium
avium-intracellular (mycobacterium avium complex). Azithromycin is used most commonly
(Choice D).
