The presence of a generalized rash, lymphadenopathy, and a corkscrew-shaped organism
on histopathology suggests secondary syphilis, a spirochetal infection caused by Treponema
pallidum. \Inoculation occurs via skin-to-skin contact during sexual intercourse; replication of T
pallidum at the site of transmission results in an ulcer with heaped up borders (primary
syphilis). Subsequent spread through the dermal lymphatic system leads to systemic spread.

Secondary syphilis develops in untreated patients weeks or months after the chancre has
resolved. Common manifestations include a diffuse, macular rash and generalized
lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is generally made with nontreponemal (eg, rapid plasma
reagin) and treponemal-specific (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) serologic
testing because microscopy is technically difficult and less sensitive. However, dark-field
microscopy or specialized silver stains can identify the spirochete.

All stages of syphilis are most effectively treated with penicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic that
disrupts cell wall synthesis by inhibiting transpeptidase, a bacterial enzyme necessary for cell
wall cross-linking. Because penicillin is effective only against bacteria that are dividing, and
because T pallidum replicates slowly, penicillin preparations that provide prolonged exposure
(eg, intramuscular penicillin G benzathine) are required.
