Educational objective:

Bacterial vaginosis causes a thin, gray or clear, malodorous discharge from overgrowth of
anaerobes (eg, Gardnerella vaginalis) and a loss of lactobacilli in the vaginal flora. Diagnosis
is confirmed by the presence of clue cells and a positive amine whiff test with potassium
hydroxide. Treatment is with clindamycin or metronidazole.
