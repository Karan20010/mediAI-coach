Syphilis: diagnostic serology

Nontreponemal ¢ Antibody to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen
(RPR, VDRL) ¢ Lower sensitivity in early infection

Treponemal ¢ Antibody to treponemal antigens
(FTA-ABS, TP-EIA) |¢ Greater sensitivity in early infection

FTA-ABS = fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (test); RPR = rapid plasma reagin (test);

TP-EIA = Treponema pallidum enzyme immunoassay.
