susceptibility to acquiring HIV infection. Therefore, HIV testing is recommended.

(Choice A) Pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis) infection is confirmed on microscopy after
sampling the perianal area for eggs with an adhesive paddle or cellophane tape. This
condition can present with severe pruritus but does not cause verrucous lesions.

(Choice B) Colonoscopy with terminal ileoscopy is used to evaluate for ileocolonic Crohn
disease. Patients commonly have perianal involvement, but typical findings include painful
abscesses and draining fistulae.

(Choice C) Condylomata lata are a manifestation of secondary syphilis, which can be
confirmed by direct visualization of Treponema pallidum on darkfield microscopy of the tissue
or exudate. Although condylomata lata may present as verruciform lesions resembling AGW,
biopsy typically reveals a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.

(Choice D) Portal hypertension can lead to dilation of peripheral portosystemic collaterals.
Involvement of the rectal submucosal veins (connecting the inferior mesenteric and iliac
systems) can cause rectal varices, which present as enlarged veins resembling internal
hemorrhoids. External verrucae are more consistent with AGW.
