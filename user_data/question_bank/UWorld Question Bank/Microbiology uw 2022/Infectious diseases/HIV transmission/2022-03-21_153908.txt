(Choice B) Antibodies against HIV surface glycoproteins (eg, gp120) help neutralize
circulating virus and reduce viral load. However, HIV surface glycoproteins display a high
degree of antigenic variation, which prevents the formation of a completely effective antibody
response.

(Choices C and E) Patients with HIV develop immunosuppression primarily due to
impairments in the cell-mediated immune response. Although the humoral immune response
is also impaired, patients are able to generate anti-HIV antibodies that partially neutralize the
virus. It is very rare that a patient with HIV will be too immunodeficient to seroconvert.

(Choice D) Acute retroviral syndrome is marked by an extremely high rate of viral replication.
Although antibodies eventually form, the response is delayed because the humoral immune
response takes several weeks to fully develon.
