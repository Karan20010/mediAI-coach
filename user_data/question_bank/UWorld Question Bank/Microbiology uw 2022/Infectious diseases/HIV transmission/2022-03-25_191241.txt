Treatment is as follows:

¢ Gonorrhea with positive/uncertain Chlamydia status (as in this patient) is treated with
ceftriaxone and doxycycline to provide dual coverage for gonorrhea (ceftriaxone plus
doxycycline) and coverage for potential Chlamydia coinfection (doxycycline).

¢ Gonorrhea with negative Chlamydia NAAT is treated with ceftriaxone alone (Choice D).

¢ Positive Chlamydia with no gonorrhea is treated with azithromycin or doxycycline
monotherapy.
