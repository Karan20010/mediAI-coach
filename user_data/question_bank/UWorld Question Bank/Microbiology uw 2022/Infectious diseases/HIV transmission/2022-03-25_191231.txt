This young man with dysuria and penile discharge likely has infectious urethritis due to
sexually transmitted infection. Most cases are caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia
trachomatis, or Mycoplasma genitalium; simultaneous infection with multiple pathogens is
common.

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) of urethral, vaginal, or anal swabs is used to
identify the causative organism. When available, light microscopy with Gram stain is
performed to rapidly diagnose N gonorrhoeae infection while awaiting NAAT results.
Gonococcal urethritis is diagnosed when there are leukocytes with intracellular gram-
negative diplococci; nongonococcal urethritis is diagnosed when there are no organisms
present (because C trachomatis does not have significant peptidoglycan in the cell wall, it
cannot be identified on Gram stain).
