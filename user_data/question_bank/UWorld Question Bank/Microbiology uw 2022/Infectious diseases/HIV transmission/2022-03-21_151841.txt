Chlamydia trachomatis is a small, gram-negative (albeit difficult to stain), obligate
intracellular bacterium. Serotypes A through C cause ocular infection (trachoma) in children;
serotypes D through K cause urogenital (sexually transmitted) infections and inclusion
conjunctivitis; and serotypes L1 through L3 cause lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV).

LGV is characterized initially by a painless, small, shallow genital ulcer containing infected
cells. The painless nature helps distinguish LGV from other diseases. The appearance of the
ulcer is followed weeks later by swollen, painful, coalescing inguinal nodes ("buboes") that
can develop stellate abscesses and rupture. If left untreated, LGV can cause fibrosis,
lymphatic obstruction, and anogenital strictures and fistulas. Histologically, LGV lesions
contain areas of mixed granulomatous and neutrophilic inflammation with intracytoplasmic
chlamydial inclusion bodies in epithelial and inflammatory cells.

Doxycycline is recommended. Although it is relatively uncommon in the United States or
Western Europe, LGV is endemic in some parts of the world.
