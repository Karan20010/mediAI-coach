This patient likely has disseminated gonorrheal infection (triad of arthritis, dermatitis, and
tenosynovitis in a sexually active woman) due to Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In mucosal regions
as well as in secretions, IgA exists in its secretory form, composed of an IgA dimer (joined by a
peptide J chain) and a peptide secretory component. IgA antibodies usually bind to pili and
other membrane proteins involved in bacterial adherence to mucosa, thus inhibiting mucosal
colonization by the microorganism.

Certain bacteria (eg, N gonorrhoeae, N meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae) produce IgA proteases that cleave IgA at its hinge region (yielding Fab and
compromised Fc fragments), thus decreasing its effectiveness. This facilitates bacterial
adherence to mucosa (possibly due to easier bacterial access to mucosal surface or immune
disguise by binding to released Fab fragments, among others).
