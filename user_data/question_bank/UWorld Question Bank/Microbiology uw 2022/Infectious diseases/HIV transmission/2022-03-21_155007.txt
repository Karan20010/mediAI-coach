Educational objective:

Neisseria gonorrhoeae is spread sexually by genitourinary secretions and can be prevented by
the consistent use of condoms. Genitourinary infections are often asymptomatic, which
increases the risk of spread through the bloodstream, leading to disseminated gonococcal
infection. Patients with disseminated disease typically present with the triad of polyarthralgia,

tenosvnovitis. and dermatitis or purulent arthritis.
