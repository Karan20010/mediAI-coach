(Choice A) Both hepatitis C virus and HIV encode for a viral protease that cleaves viral
polyprotein into individual proteins. Protease inhibitors target this step in viral replication and
are used for treatment. HBV does not generate a polyprotein; therefore, it does not encode for
a viral protease.

(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus type 1 establishes a life-long latent infection within sensory
neurons where it expresses latency-associated transcript, a non-protein coding RNA molecule
that suppresses viral lytic genes and inhibits host cell apoptosis.

(Choice C) Although HBV can insert its genome into host chromosomes (which contributes to
hepatocarcinogenesis), this step is not required for viral replication. In contrast, HIV must
integrate into the host genome in order to replicate. Integrase inhibitors (eg, dolutegravir)
target this step in HIV replication.

(Choice D) HBV is released via exocytosis from host cells and is not considered a lytic virus.
Hepatocyte damage occurs primarily when cytotoxic T cells recognize HBV antigens on
infected cells. Patients who clear the virus have a robust, polyclonal, cytotoxic T-cell
response. Those that develop latent infection often have a much weaker and narrower
cytotoxic T-cell response.
