(Choice B) Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, an ulcerative, sexually transmitted
infection characterized by painful (rather than painless) red papules on the genitals that
eventually erode to become tender ulcers (you "do cry" with H ducreyi). Regional lymph nodes
may swell and become chronic ulcers.

(Choice C) Herpes simplex virus type 2 is the most common cause of genital herpes,
characterized by vesicles that develop into shallow ulcers. These lesions are often painful and
heal within 10 days. Histologically, multinucleated giant cells and large pinkish-purple
intranuclear (not intracytoplasmic) inclusions, termed Cowdry type A bodies, are present.

(Choice D) Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale (donovanosis), which also
initially manifests as a painless genital papule that eventually ulcerates; however,
lymphadenopathy is uncommon. Intracytoplasmic Donovan bodies are diagnostic. If
donovanosis is untreated, scarring and strictures can lead to severe lymphatic obstruction and
lymphedema (elephantiasis).

(Choice E) Syphilis, caused by the gram-negative spirochete Treponema pallidum, is initially
characterized by a painless lesion (chancre) that heals without treatment within weeks. It does
not typically develop into buboes and is not characterized by cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.
