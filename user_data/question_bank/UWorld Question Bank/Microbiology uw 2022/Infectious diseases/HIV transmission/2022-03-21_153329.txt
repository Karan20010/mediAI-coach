This patient with HIV was recently started on antiretroviral therapy and subsequently
developed evidence of proximal tubule dysfunction (eg, hypophosphatemia, glucosuria,
proteinuria, biopsy abnormalities), raising concern for tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity.
Tenofovir is a common part of first-line HIV therapy. It is an adenosine analogue that is a
member of the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). NRTIs prevent reverse
transcriptase from converting the HIV RNA genome into complementary double-stranded DNA,
which inhibits viral replication.

Tenofovir is primarily eliminated via the proximal tubule cells of the kidney. High
concentrations of tenofovir in these cells can interfere with mitochondrial DNA synthesis and
result in cellular damage. This typically manifests with acute kidney injury (eg, elevated
creatinine, water retention) and/or signs of proximal tubule dysfunction (eg, phosphaturia,
glucosuria, proteinuria). Histopathology may show damage to proximal tubule cells (eg, loss of
brush border, basement membrane denudation) and evidence of giant mitochondria (eg, large
eosinophilic inclusions). Renal abnormalities typically improve once tenofovir is discontinued.
