Retroviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors prevent the synthesis of viral DNA from the RNA
template. Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) do not require
activation via intracellular phosphorylation. The more common NNRTIs include nevirapine
and efavirenz. They are best used in conjunction with other antiretroviral agents for the
treatment of HIV infection.

Adverse effects are common with NNRTIs. Abrupt-onset flulike symptoms, abdominal pain,
jaundice, or fever may indicate potentially life-threatening hepatic failure (most likely to occur
within the first 6 weeks of NNRTI therapy). Life-threatening skin reactions (eg, Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis) have also been observed.
