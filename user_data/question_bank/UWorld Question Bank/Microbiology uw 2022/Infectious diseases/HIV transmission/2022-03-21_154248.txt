This patient's opportunistic infection (oropharyngeal/esophageal candidiasis), positive HIV
immunoassay testing, and low CD4 count suggest a diagnosis of AIDS. However, she has no
detectable HIV-1 RNA in her bloodstream. Although HIV-1 causes most cases of AIDS
worldwide (and nearly all cases in the United States), AIDS can also be due to infection with
HIV-2, which is endemic to West Africa (eg, Senegal).

Patients infected with HIV-2 have much lower levels of viremia than those infected with HIV-
1. Because viremia is directly correlated with transmission risk, rate of CD4 count decline, and
progression to AIDS, individuals with HIV-2 are usually less infectious and have longer
asymptomatic periods than patients with HIV-1. The diagnosis of HIV-2 is often suspected
when HIV test results are incongruent; most patients will have the following laboratory
results:
