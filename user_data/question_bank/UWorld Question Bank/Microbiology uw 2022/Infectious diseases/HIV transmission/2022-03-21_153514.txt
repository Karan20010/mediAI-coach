This patient likely has a chancre due to primary syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection
caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Spirochetes are universally sensitive to
penicillin because they are all gram-negative organisms with a peptidoglycan cell wall.

Penicillins work by covalently binding to and inhibiting transpeptidase. This enzyme
catalyzes the final cross-linking step in peptidoglycan cell wall formation: the joining of the
amino acid in the third position of a peptidoglycan molecule to the terminal D-alanine-D-
alanine of another peptidoglycan molecule. The structural similarity of penicillins to D-alanine-
D-alanine likely facilitates their binding to transpeptidase. When transpeptidase is inhibited,
cell wall synthesis ceases and cell wall degradation by bacterial autolysins proceeds
unchecked. The weakened cell wall integrity causes osmotic lysis of the bacterium.

Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, directly binds to the D-alanine-D-alanine residues,
preventing the incorporation of new subunits into the cell wall. Vancomycin acts at an earlier
stage of cell wall formation than do the penicillins.
