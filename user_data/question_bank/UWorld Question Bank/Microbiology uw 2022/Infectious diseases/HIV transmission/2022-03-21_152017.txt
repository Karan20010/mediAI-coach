Herpetic gingivostomatitis is a severe vesicular or ulcerative disease following primary
infection with herpes simplex virus type 1. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of
multinucleated giant cells in a Tzanck smear. Involvement of the gingiva, tongue, palate, and
pharynx along with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise) is common. In contrast, herpes
reactivation in the trigeminal ganglia generally results in mild perioral vesicles.
