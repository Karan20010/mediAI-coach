Educational objective:

A new-onset genital vesicular rash with a positive Tzanck smear in a previously asymptomatic
patient is suggestive of primary genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection due to HSV-2.
Recurrences of genital herpes can be reduced through daily treatment with oral valacyclovir,
acyclovir, or famciclovir. Condom use can help prevent a primary genital HSV infection but
does not prevent reactivation of latent infection.
