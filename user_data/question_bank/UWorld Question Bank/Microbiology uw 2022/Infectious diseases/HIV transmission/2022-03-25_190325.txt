After an HIV virion enters a host cell, viral RNA is released from the nucleocapsid and
transcribed into double-stranded DNA by reverse transcriptase. The viral DNA then enters
the nucleus and, through the actions of integrase, permanently inserts into the host cell's
chromosomes to become a provirus. RNA polymerase II then transcribes viral mRNA from
the proviral DNA. Once synthesized, HIV mRNA exits through the nuclear pores into the
cytoplasm, where it uses the host cell's ribosomes to translate the enzymes, glycoproteins,
structural proteins, and regulatory proteins needed to promote viral replication and
transmission. The full-length mRNA also serves as the viral genome that is packaged into
newly synthesized virions.

Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor that disrupts the ability of double-stranded HIV DNA to
integrate into the host cell's chromosomes. In the absence of integration, the viral

genome cannot be transcribed by host cellular machinery and is eventually degraded by
nucleases.
