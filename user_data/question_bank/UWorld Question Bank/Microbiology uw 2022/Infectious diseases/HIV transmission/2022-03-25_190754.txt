Secondary syphilis is characterized by the spread of the causative spirochete, Treponema
pallidum, through the blood to the skin and mucosal surfaces. Patients usually have a diffuse
maculopapular skin rash that includes the palms and soles. They may also develop
condylomata lata, which are painless, wart-like, elevated plaques, on moist areas of the skin
such as the scrotum and perineum. Lymphadenopathy, fatigue, arthralgias, and mild fever
are also common. Histopathologic examination of syphilitic lesions (at all stages) classically
demonstrates proliferative endarteritis of small vessels with a surrounding plasma cell—rich
infiltrate.

This patient was likely infected with syphilis at the same time he was infected with gonorrhea
(coinfection is common). Serologic testing for syphilis (eg, rapid plasma reagin) is often falsely
negative in early infection due to lag time between acquisition of T pallidum and the
development of a measurable humoral antibody response. Patients who do not notice or
ignore the genital chancre of primary syphilis often develop secondary syphilis 2 — 10 weeks
later.
