Researchers analyze the HIV viral structure and replication cycle for new drug targets. They
find the virus encodes a large glycoprotein, which gets cleaved into 2 subunits, the surface and
transmembrane subunits. These subunits remain noncovalently bound to each other in the
virion. Upon activation of the surface protein, conformational changes occur in the
transmembrane subunit exposing the functional inner core. A novel drug is developed that
selectively binds and prevents normal functioning of the transmembrane subunit, interfering
with the normal viral replication cycle. This agent most likely directly inhibits which of the
following viral processes?

© A. Attachment of the virus to target cell surface

©) B. Budding and release of a new virus particle

(©) C. Cleavage of polyproteins by viral encoded enzyme
©) D. Entry of the viral core into host cytoplasm

©) E. Integration of the viral DNA into host genome

|) F. Synthesis of DNA from viral RNA template

() G. Transcription of mRNA from proviral DNA Activate Windows
