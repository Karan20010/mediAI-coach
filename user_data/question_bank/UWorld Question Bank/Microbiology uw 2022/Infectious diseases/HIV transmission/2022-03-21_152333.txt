persistence of HBeAg and lack of anti-HBeAg).

(Choice A) Were this patient to have fully recovered from his bout of acute hepatitis B, all
antigens should have dropped to undetectable levels and he should have high levels of anti-
HBsAg IgG and anti-HBcAg IgG.

(Choice B) An exacerbation of preexisting hepatitis B would be characterized by a decline
followed by a spike in antigen levels.

(Choice C) Acute hepatitis B that progressed to chronic hepatitis with low infectivity would be
indicated by a graph similar to the one shown for this patient. However, there would be low or
undetectable levels of HBeAg (the marker for high infectivity) and likely detectable quantities of
anti-HBeAg.

(Choice E) Vaccination against HBV would be identified by a surge in anti-HBsAb with no
anti-HBcAg, anti-HBeAg, or viral antigens detected.

Educational objective:
If HBeAg persists for several months and host anti-HBeAg remain at low or undetectable
levels, suspect chronic hepatitis B infection with high infectivity.
