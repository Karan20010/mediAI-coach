3 (Choice A) The enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridine

4 ae

5 monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). N5, N10-methylene

6 tetrahydrofolate is the methyl donor in this reaction and is converted to dihydrofolate (DHF) in

z the process. Tetrahydrofolate is then regenerated from DHF by dihydrofolate reductase.

EEN) Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that inhibits DNA synthesis by inhibiting
: dihydrofolate reductase.

(Choice B) Integration of viral DNA into the host genome is mediated by integrase, an HIV
14 enzyme that is inhibited by integrase strand transfer inhibitors (eg, raltegravir).

16 (Choice C) Inhibition of nucleoside phosphorylation is not an effect of ZDT. In fact,
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (including ZDT) must be phosphorylated within the
host cell to form the functional triphosphate moiety. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors can bind directly to (and inactivate) reverse transcriptase without being
phosphorylated.

(Choice E) In double-stranded DNA, A always pairs with T, and G always pairs with C. These
bases bind via hydrogen bonds. Some chemotherapeutic agents, such as the anthracyclines
daunorubicin and doxorubicin, intercalate between the bases, causing defective base pairing
and splitting of the DNA strands. Transcription and replication failure and mutagenesis
