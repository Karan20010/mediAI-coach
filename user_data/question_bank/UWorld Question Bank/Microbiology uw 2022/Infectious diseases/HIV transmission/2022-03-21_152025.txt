(Choice A) An abortive viral infection refers to an infection in which the virus enters the cell
but does not successfully produce new infective virus. Therefore, an abortive infection is not
capable of causing disease.

(Choice B) HSV is capable of latency by integrating into the trigeminal (or sacral, for HSV-2)
ganglia. However, during latency no virus is produced and therefore no clinical disease
occurs.

(Choice D) Aslow virus infection is characterized by a prolonged incubation period that lasts
months to years. During this time, the virus gradually multiplies before finally causing clinically
apparent disease. Examples of slow viral infections include HIV, hepatitis C, and subacute
sclerosing panencephalitis following measles infection.

(Choice E) Reactivation of HSV from the trigeminal ganglia causes herpes labialis. In
contrast to gingivostomatitis, recurrent labialis disease is usually mild, unilateral, and limited to
the lips due to host immune mechanisms (eg, presence of neutralizing antibody & HSV-
specific cytotoxic T cells).
