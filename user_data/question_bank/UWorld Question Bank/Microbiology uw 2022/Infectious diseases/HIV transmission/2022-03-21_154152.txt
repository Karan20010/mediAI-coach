This patient developed a genital ulcer a few weeks after unprotected intercourse, raising
suspicion for a sexually transmitted infection. A wide range of pathogens can cause genital
ulcers, but a solitary, painless ulcer with heaped-up borders and a clean base usually
indicates primary syphilis (syphilitic chancre). Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum, a
gram-negative spirochete that cannot be cultured and cannot be detected on Gram stain due
to its small size.

The diagnosis of syphilis relies primarily on nontreponemal (eg, rapid plasma reagin, VDRL)
and treponemal (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption) serologic testing. However,
because humoral antibody response often takes 4 weeks to develop, false-negative
serologic testing is common early in the course of disease. Nontreponemal tests are
particularly susceptible to initial false-negative results (as in this patient); treponemal tests are
more sensitive in early infection and are often used preferentially in this setting.

Although not widely available, the diagnostic gold standard for syphilis is to directly visualize
the organism in tissue scrapings from a cutaneous lesion (eg, chancre). This can involve
fluorescent antibody testing or dark-field microscopy, which will show motile, helical
spirochetes.
