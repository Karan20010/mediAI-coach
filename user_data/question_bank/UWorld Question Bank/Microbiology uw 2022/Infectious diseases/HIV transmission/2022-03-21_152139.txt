antiretroviral regimen and should be encouraged to take it as prescribed.
(Choice A) HIV infection results in the generation of antibodies that can reduce free virus in
the circulatory system but cannot eliminate the infection due to viral integration into the host
genome. The primary target of neutralizing antibodies against HIV is the surface glycoprotein

GP120, which is encoded by the env gene, not the po/ gene.

(Choice C) The HIV nef gene encodes for a protein that downregulates major
histocompatibility complex class | proteins, reducing the ability of cytotoxic T cells to recognize
host cells infected with HIV. Po/ gene mutations are unlikely to directly influence the ability of
CD68 cells to respond to the infection.

(Choice D) HIV infection triggers CD4 cell apoptosis through many mechanisms, including
chronic immunologic stimulation, activation of the CD4 receptor by envelope glycoproteins
(during viral attachment), and increased production of cytotoxic ligands by immune cells.
Mutations to the po/ gene are unlikely to result in a reduction in CD4 apoptosis.

(Choice E) Viral replication rate is generally positively correlated with the mutation rate.

Educational objective:
HIV pol gene mutations are responsible for acquired resistance to reverse transcriptase
