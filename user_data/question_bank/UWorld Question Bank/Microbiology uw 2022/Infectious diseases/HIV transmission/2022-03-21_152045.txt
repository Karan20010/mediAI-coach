Many strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae have pili, hair-like protein polymers projecting from the
bacterial surface that are involved in organism attachment to mucosal surfaces. When the
host produces antibodies against gonococcal pili, mucosal adherence is inhibited. At a given
time, only 1 pilus gene is functional, so only 1 pilus type is expressed. However, the structural
genes for pilus proteins undergo antigenic variation at a high frequency; they undergo
recombination with each other to produce new antigenic types of pili. The number of possible
antigenic pilus types is theoretically quite large. This diversity is a reason that vaccine
development against N gonorrhoeae pili has been challenging.
