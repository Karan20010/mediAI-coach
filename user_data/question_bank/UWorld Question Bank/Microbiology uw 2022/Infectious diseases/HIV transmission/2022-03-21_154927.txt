Educational objective:

Urinalysis in patients with Chlamydia trachomatis infection classically shows sterile pyuria
(positive urine white blood cells, no bacteria on Gram stain, no growth on culture) because the
C trachomatis bacterium is an obligate intracellular parasite with minimal peptidoglycan in its
cell wall. The diagnostic test of choice is nucleic acid amplification testing.
