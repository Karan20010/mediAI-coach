Oral thrush, interstitial pneumonia, and severe lymphopenia during the first year of life are
consistent with mother-to-child vertical transmission of HIV-1. The risk of HIV infection
occurring in an infant born to an HIV-positive mother who received no prenatal antiretroviral
therapy (ART) can be as high as 35%. ART during pregnancy reduces the risk of perinatal
transmission to 1%-2%. All pregnant women with HIV should take ART, regardless of their

CD4 cell count or viral load.

Triple combination therapy is recommended for HIV-positive pregnant women (as it is for all
HIV-positive adults) and most commonly has a backbone of 2 nucleoside/nucleotide reverse
transcriptase inhibitors along with a third drug (protease inhibitor, non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor, or integrase inhibitor). Drugs that are associated with a teratogenic risk
(eg, efavirenz in first 8 weeks) or for which there is insufficient evidence during pregnancy are
to be avoided. ART should be continued as long as women are breastfeeding. Infants
generally receive several weeks of prophylaxis (zidovudine).
