(Choices B and C) Nef and tat are HIV regulatory genes. The nef gene product
downregulates the expression of class | major histocompatibility complex proteins on the
surface of infected cells, which limits immune recognition by cytotoxic T cells. The tat gene
product is a transcriptional activator that promotes viral gene expression.

(Choice A) HIV integrase is a viral enzyme that inserts the viral cDNA into the host cell
chromosome.

(Choice D) The CD3 receptor is found on the surface of mature T lymphocytes. Monoclonal
antibodies against CD3 are being investigated for autoimmune disorders, but this receptor
does not play a role in HIV entry.

(Choice F) CTLA4 (CD-152) is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Antagonists of CTLA4
are used as immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer therapy (eg, melanoma).
