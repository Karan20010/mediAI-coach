This patient has fever, arthralgias, diffuse lymphadenopathy, elevated aminotransferases, and
widespread maculopapular rash raising suspicion for secondary syphilis. Syphilis is a
multistage infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Diagnostic screening
and confirmation rely primarily on serologic testing.

Nontreponemal serologic tests (rapid plasma reagin, VDRL) mix a patient's serum with a
cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen. Aggregation or flocculation (clumping) indicates the
presence of anticardiolipin antibodies in the patient's serum. These antibodies form in
response to the release of lipids from cells damaged by T pallidum. However, anticardiolipin
antibodies are nonspecific; they can also develop in other treponemal (eg, yaws, pinta, bejel)
and nontreponemal (eg, tuberculosis) infections and certain rheumatologic diseases (eg,
lupus), which can lead to false-positive results.

Positive nontreponemal screening requires diagnostic confirmation with treponemal serologic
testing (eg, fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption). Treponemal tests evaluate for
antibodies that directly target T pallidum; patient serum is mixed with killed T pallidum to
evaluate for antibody adherence using immunofluorescence. Patients with positive
nontreponemal and treponemal tests are considered infected with syphilis.
