(Choices A and B) Patients with chronic hepatitis B have elevated HBsAg >6 months after
initial infection. Chronic hepatitis B with high infectivity is represented by persistent elevation
of HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBV DNA with no anti-HBe. Transition from high infectivity to low
infectivity usually occurs years later and is marked by anti-HBe, the elimination of HBeAg, and
the continued production of HBsAg.

(Choice C) Patients with an exacerbation of chronic hepatitis B have an abrupt increase in
liver enzymes and increased levels of HBV DNA. Exacerbations are often asymptomatic, but
some individuals develop symptoms of acute hepatitis.

(Choice D) Vaccination against hepatitis B would be identified by the presence of anti-HBs
with no anti-HBc, anti-HBe, or viral antigens.

Educational objective:

The presence of anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies in the serum without detectable viral
antigens indicates recovery from acute hepatitis B infection. In contrast, patients vaccinated
against hepatitis B will have anti-HBs antibodies without detectable levels of anti-HBc. Chronic
hepatitis B is indicated by persistent levels of HBSAg and HBV DNA in the serum.
