(Choices A, B, and C) The po/ gene encodes for reverse transcriptase, integrase, and
protease, three crucial HIV enzymes. Reverse transcriptase converts single-stranded viral
RNA into double-stranded DNA, which is then integrated into the host genome by integrase.
Protease helps cleave HIV polyproteins into individual proteins after transcription in the rough
endoplasmic reticulum. These enzymes are not glycosylated.

(Choice E) Uninfected CD4 cells can undergo activation-induced apoptosis when responding
to HIV peptides displayed on the surface of infected cells. CD4 cells infected with HIV are
damaged primarily through direct cytopathic effects. Both mechanisms contribute to CD4 cell
depletion in HIV infection.
