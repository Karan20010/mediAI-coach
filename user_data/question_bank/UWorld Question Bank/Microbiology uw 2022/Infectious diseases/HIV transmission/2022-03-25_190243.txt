Los intimal atheromas can destroy and weaken the underlying media, resulting in aortic

B (Choices B and C) Intimal tear and medial degeneration (elastic tissue fragmentation and
“4 separation of the elastic and fibromuscular components of the tunica media by small, cleft-like
as

pain radiating to the back), not aortic aneurysms.

(Choice D) Large vessel arteritides with medial inflammation (eg, Takayasu, giant cell
arteritis) might rarely promote an aortic aneurysm; however, they are not associated with a
positive serology for syphilis.

Educational objective:

Tertiary syphilis can result in thoracic aortic aneurysm. If the aneurysm compresses adjacent
structures and dilates the aortic valve ring, a murmur and mediastinal widening might be
present. The pathogenesis begins with vasa vasorum endarteritis and obliteration, resulting in
