Educational objective:

Hepatitis B virus has a partially double-stranded DNA genome and contains a viral DNA
polymerase with reverse transcriptase activity. Reverse transcriptase serves a crucial step in
viral replication; it converts transcribed positive sense single-stranded RNA into the partially

double-stranded DNA genome of viral progeny.
