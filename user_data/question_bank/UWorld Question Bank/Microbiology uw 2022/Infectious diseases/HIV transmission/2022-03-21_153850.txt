Most patients infected with HIV develop mononucleosis-like symptoms (eg, fever, diffuse
lymphadenopathy, malaise, myalgia, sore throat, and headache) 2-4 weeks after inoculation
(acute retroviral syndrome). The presence of oropharyngeal ulcers and a diffuse
maculopapular rash are important diagnostic clues.

Acute retroviral syndrome is associated with extremely high levels of viral replication (~5
million copies/mL) as the cell-mediated and humoral antibody response against the virus is not
yet fully activated. Therefore, laboratory results during this period usually show evidence of
HIV in the plasma (positive viral load and p24 antigen) with a negative serologic response
(negative HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody). This is referred to as the "window period," as patients are
infected with HIV but HIV antibody screening tests may be negative (newer screening tests.
incorporate testing for HIV p24 antigen and are more sensitive in early infection).

The humoral response to HIV typically develops 6-8 weeks after initial infection. At this time,
anti-HIV antibodies in the serum neutralize circulating virus, which reduces viral load and leads
to resolution of acute retroviral symptoms. Most patients then enter a long asymptomatic
period until diminished CD4 counts open the door to opportunistic infections.
