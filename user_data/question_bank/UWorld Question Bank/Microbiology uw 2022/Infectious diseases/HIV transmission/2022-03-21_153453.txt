(Choice B) Immunoglobulin therapy can be used for varicella postexposure prophylaxis (eg,
in neonates or pregnant women) but is not commonly used for genital HSV infections.

(Choice C) Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity
against HIV and hepatitis B virus. It is not known to be effective against HSV-2.

(Choice D) Although condom use may prevent sexual transmission of HSV-2 (and therefore
might have prevented this patient from acquiring his primary genital HSV-2 infection), it does
not reduce the frequency of recurrence of genital herpes.

(Choice E) A short (7-10 days) course of treatment with oral acyclovir during primary genital
HSV infection usually reduces the duration of viral shedding, time for lesional healing, and
local pain; however, it does not appear to alter recurrence rates.
