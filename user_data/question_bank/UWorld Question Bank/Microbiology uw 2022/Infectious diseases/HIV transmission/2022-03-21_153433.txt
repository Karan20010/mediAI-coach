This patient's recurrent vesicular lesions and positive Tzanck smear are consistent with
recurrent genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), generally due to reactivation of latent HSV-2
infection within the S2, S3, and S4 dorsal root (sensory) ganglia. Recurrence of genital HSV
can be suppressed or minimized with daily oral valacyclovir (preferred as it is dosed once daily
and has good bioavailability), acyclovir, or famciclovir. Although the antiviral agents may not
be active against latent virus forms, they can suppress further multiplication as soon as
reactivation occurs. Suppressive therapy would likely have been offered to this patient with
multiple yearly episodes of recurrence; it is generally continued for years with periodic re-

evaluation.
