(Choice A) Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Patients with early
Lyme disease often develop flulike symptoms and a bull's-eye rash (not a diffuse
maculopapular rash). Serologic testing for IgM/IgG against Borrelia can aid in the diagnosis as
the disease progresses.

(Choice B) Rheumatoid factor is an antibody that targets the Fc portion of IgG. Elevations
are often seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases.

(Choice C) Histoplasma capsulatum infection can be diagnosed by examining urine and
serum for fungal antigens. Histoplasma infections usually present with prominent pulmonary
manifestations rather than diffuse rash and lymphadenopathy.

(Choice D) Antimitochondrial antibodies are present in >95% of cases of primary biliary
cholangitis, which usually causes fatigue, pruritus, hepatomegaly, and elevated alkaline
phosphatase. This patient's systemic maculopapular rash and diffuse lymphadenopathy make
syphilis more likely.
