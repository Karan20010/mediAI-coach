HIV attaches to host cells using the viral surface glycoprotein gp120. This glycoprotein binds
to the CD4 molecule as the primary receptor and the chemokine receptor CCRS5 (or CXCR4)
as a coreceptor. Binding of the primary receptor and coreceptor induces a conformational
change in gp120 that exposes the underlying transmembrane glycoprotein gp41, which
mediates viral fusion to the host cell and release of the viral capsid into the cytoplasm.

The drug described in this case does not interfere with viral attachment but does interfere with
viral fusion. This implies that gp120 is still able to bind to the primary CD4 receptor but may be
blocked from binding to the chemokine coreceptor, which would prevent the conformational
change to gp120 required for viral fusion. Chemokine receptor antagonists (eg, maraviroc)
block this step in the HIV replication cycle. The drug described in this case could also be a
fusion inhibitor (eg, enfuvirtide), which blocks gp41 from fusing the viral and host plasma
membranes.
