HIV binds to host cells using the host CD4 receptor and a chemokine coreceptor (either CCR5
or CXCR4). The virus preferentially targets T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages
because these cells contain high surface concentrations of CD4. However, each of these cell
types contains different surface concentrations of the 2 chemokine receptors. HIV is
considered tropic for a certain cell type, depending on whether it preferentially binds to CCR5
or CXCR4 for viral entry, as follows:

¢ R5 virus uses CCRS for viral entry and is considered macrophage-tropic because CCR5
is expressed in high concentrations on both macrophages and lymphocytes. R5 is the
predominant HIV type.

¢ X4 virus uses CXCR4 for viral entry and is considered T lymphotropic because CXCR4
is expressed primarily on T lymphocytes but only minimally on macrophages.

HIV trophism is determined by a gene sequence in the variable (V3) region of the env gene,
which encodes for the HIV surface glycoprotein 120. This glycoprotein mediates viral
attachment to the CD4 receptor and chemokine coreceptor.

The laboratory results in this case indicate an X4 virus (T lymphotropic with minimal
macrophage invasion). Patients with X4 virus cannot be treated with HIV medications that
target CCR5 (eg, maraviroc) because the X4 virus uses CXCR4, not CCRS5, to enter cells.
