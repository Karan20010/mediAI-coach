The clinical presentation of syphilis occurs in well-defined stages:
¢ Primary syphilis manifests as a painless ulceration with raised, indurated borders. This
chancre develops at the Treponema pallidum inoculation site (most commonly penis or
vulva) 1-3 weeks after contact and resolves in 3-6 weeks. The organism commonly
disseminates systemically during this stage.
¢ Secondary syphilis, a bacteremic stage that develops 5-10 weeks following chancre
resolution, presents with a diffuse macular rash, as shown in the exhibit, encompassing
the palms and soles. Condylomata lata, large gray wartlike growths typically appearing in
the genital/perineal region, are another typical manifestation.
¢ Latent syphilis is an asymptomatic period divided into early latent (infection within past
year) and late latent (infection >1 year ago).

2.
¢ Late (tertiary) syphilis develops many years after infection in untreated individuals.

Gummas are characteristic and often begin as painless, indurated granulomatous lesions
that progress to white-gray rubbery lesions that may ulcerate. They are most commonly
cutaneous but also appear in the subcutaneous tissue, bones, liver, and other organs.
Tertiary syphilis can also manifest as cardiovascular involvement with ascending aortic
aneurysms (with calcification seen on x-ray) and resultant aortic valve insufficiency
(murmur, high-pitched tambour S2).

Neurosyphilis, which may be asymptomatic or cause subacute meningoencephalitis, tabes

dorsalis, or other neurologic sequelae, is a common manifestation of late syphilis but can

occur at any stage.
