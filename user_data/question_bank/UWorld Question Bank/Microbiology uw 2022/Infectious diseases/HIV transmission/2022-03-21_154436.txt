(Choice A) Patients with advanced HIV who have low CD4 counts are at greater risk for
mucocutaneous Candida infections (eg, thrush, esophagitis). However, routine prophylaxis
against Candida infection is not recommended due to risk of drug resistance and drug
interactions.

(Choice B) Patients with HIV who have CD4 counts <100/mm: are at risk for cryptococcal
meningitis. However, prophylaxis is not recommended against Cryptococcus due to drug
interactions, adverse effects, risk of fungal resistance, and cost. This patient's CD4 count
>100/mm:.

(Choice C) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common OI in patients with HIV who have CD4
counts <50/mm:. Reactivation frequently leads to retinitis and gastrointestinal disease (eg,
colitis). However, primary prophylaxis against CMV is not recommended due to cost, toxicity,
and the high number needed to treat to reduce risk of disease.
