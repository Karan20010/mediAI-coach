This patient with HIV likely has anal squamous cell carcinoma given the duration of pain,
itching, and rectal bleeding in addition to the visible ulcerative mass (anal cancers are
ulcerative in >50% of cases). Anogenital squamous cell carcinomas and their precursors,
squamous intraepithelial lesions, have been linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.
Intraepithelial neoplasias of the cervix, vulva, penis, and anus have a well-documented
association with HPV types 16 and 18. Astrong correlation between HPV and invasive
carcinoma has been established for cervical cancer.

Immunodeficiency states (eg, AIDS) increase host susceptibility to HPV infection and more
severe infection. HIV-positive men who have sex with men are at increased risk of developing
anal squamous cell carcinoma (anal intercourse is hypothesized to be related), and HIV-
positive women are more prone to developing cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
