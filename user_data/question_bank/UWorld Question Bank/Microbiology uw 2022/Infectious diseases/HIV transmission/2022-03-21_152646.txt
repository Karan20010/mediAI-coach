Educational objective:

Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Confirmation of the diagnosis
requires 2 forms of serologic testing to prevent false-positive results. Nontreponemal tests
(eg, rapid plasma reagin, VDRL) evaluate for anticardiolipin antibodies (nonspecific);

treponemal tests evaluate for antibodies targeted against 7 pallidum.
