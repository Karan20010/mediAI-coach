Serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure is present in ~2 billion people
worldwide. Perinatal transmission is most common in high-incidence areas (eg, sub-Saharan
Africa). In low-prevalence countries such as the United States, Western Europe, and Canada,

most cases arise due to unsafe sexual practices or injection drug use.
