This patient with neurosyphilis (headaches, memory loss, cerebrospinal fluid with Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory positivity, pleocytosis) likely has cardiovascular syphilis
(asymptomatic murmur with loud second heart sound [S2], ascending aortic arch

calcification). She therefore has late (tertiary) syphilis, and her vulvar lesion is most likely a
gumma. Achancre would be seen in primary syphilis (Choice A), and condylomata lata occur
during secondary syphilis (Choice C).
