Hemoglobin A1c is produced by irreversible nonenzymatic glycosylation of the N-terminal of
the hemoglobin molecule. The degree of glycosylation (ie, hemoglobin A1c level) directly
correlates with average blood glucose levels over the life span of circulating erythrocytes,
which is normally approximately 3 months. Higher glucose levels and increased exposure
time of red cells to glucose increase hemoglobin A1c values. As such, conditions that alter
red blood cell survival time also affect hemoglobin A1c levels.

This patient has an elevated hemoglobin A2, which suggests comorbid beta-thalassemia
minor. Hemoglobin A2 is elevated in beta-thalassemia to compensate for beta-globin—chain
underproduction, but results in microcytic red cells that are prone to hemolysis. Increased
erythrocyte turnover results in a misleadingly low hemoglobin A1c level. In such cases,
measurement of glycated serum proteins (ie, fructosamine) is sometimes used to estimate
glycemic control.

(Choices B and C) Deficiencies of iron, folate, and vitamin B,. can reduce production of new
red cells, leading to a preponderance of older erythrocytes and falsely elevated hemoglobin
Aic. In contrast, treatment of vitamin deficiencies causes young red cells to be rapidly
released into circulation, falsely lowering hemoglobin A1c.

(Choice D) Advanced diabetic nephropathy may cause reduced erythropoietin production.
