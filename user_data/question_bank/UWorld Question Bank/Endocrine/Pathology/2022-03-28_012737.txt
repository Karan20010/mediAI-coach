these cells (eg, due to autoimmune disorder) can lead to primary ovarian insufficiency and
present with infertility and secondary amenorrhea. However, patients often have
hypoestrogenic symptoms (eg, hot flashes), and this disorder would not cause visual field
defects.

(Choice C) Ovarian theca cells produce androgens, which provide the substrate for
subsequent synthesis of estrogens. Amenorrhea and infertility related to hyperactivity of these
cells are typically associated with signs of hyperandrogenism (eg, hirsutism).

(Choice E) Unlike most pituitary hormones, which are under positive regulation by the
hypothalamus, prolactin is primarily under negative regulation by hypothalamic dopaminergic
neurons via the pituitary stalk. Because of this, any pituitary tumor of significant size that
disrupts these dopaminergic pathways can cause moderate hyperprolactinemia. However,
somatotroph adenomas typically cause acromegaly, with prognathism and bony enlargement
of the hands and feet.

Educational objective:
