This patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis, a condition that most commonly affects
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus due to their absolute insulin deficiency. Type 1
diabetes mellitus occurs in genetically susceptible individuals who are exposed to triggering
environmental factors (eg, viral infections, environmental toxins, dietary components). This
results in an autoimmune response against pancreatic beta cells that leads to progressive
loss of beta cell mass. Overt manifestations of diabetes mellitus tend to develop once >90%
of beta cells are destroyed. Although antibodies against islet antigens are detected in a large
number of patients, they are thought to play a permissive role in disease pathogenesis; the
destruction of beta cells occurs primarily through cell-mediated immunity. Infiltration of islets
by inflammatory cells is called insulitis and is more prominent during the early stages of
disease.

(Choices A and B) Abdominal fat deposition and excessive body weight are important
contributors to insulin resistance and development of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Intra-abdominal
visceral fat is more strongly related to insulin resistance than is subcutaneous fat.

(Choice C) Maturity-onset diabetes of the young is an autosomal dominant disease caused
by mutations that impair glucose sensing and insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. It
presents as non-insulin-dependent diabetes at a young age (<25) and accounts for <5% of all
