plasma cholesterol from birth, due to reduced hepatic IDL and LDL uptake. Homozygotes may
have a 5- to 6-fold elevation. In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, the progression of
atherosclerosis with aging is accelerated. Complications include coronary artery disease at an
unusually young age, as was the case for the patient in the vignette.

(Choices A, B, D, E and F) Although many cell types express the LDL receptor, their rate of
LDL uptake from the circulation is usually less than that of hepatocytes. The liver is also the
major site of cholesterol catabolism and excretion, making it the most important organ in
serum cholesterol level homeostasis.

Educational Objective:

Familial hypercholesterolemia, one of the most common autosomal dominant disorders, is the
result of heterozygous or homozygous LDL receptor gene mutations, which cause hepatocyte
under-expression of functional LDL receptors. This condition can lead to accelerated
atherosclerosis and early-onset coronary artery disease.
