= This patient has fatigue, weakness, and weight loss associated with a suspicious lung mass.
5 His hypertension, ecchymoses, and hyperpigmentation suggest paraneoplastic
: hypercortisolism (Cushing syndrome) due to ectopic ACTH secretion. As with primary
8 adrenal insufficiency, excess ACTH secretion leads to hyperpigmentation, likely due to co-
= secretion of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) (both ACTH and alpha-MSH
a are derived from pro-opiomelanocortin) and direct stimulation of the MC2R receptor on
4 melanocytes by ACTH. Although patients with paraneoplastic hypercortisolism may have
i4 many of the typical metabolic features of cortisol excess (eg, hypertension, hyperglycemia,
: = edema), weight loss is more common than classic Cushingoid central obesity.

Paraneoplastic hypercortisolism is most commonly associated with small cell lung cancer but
ig can also be seen with other neuroendocrine tumors (eg, bronchial or pancreatic carcinoid).
ACTH secreted by small cell lung cancer is not inhibited by high-dose exogenous

a corticosteroids (eg, dexamethasone), whereas pituitary ACTH secretion decreases via
negative feedback.

(Choice B) Cortisol is produced by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex, and

27 autonomous cortisol production (ie, ACTH-independent hypercortisolism) is almost always due
to a primary adrenal disorder (eg, adrenal adenoma). Regardless of the source, excess
