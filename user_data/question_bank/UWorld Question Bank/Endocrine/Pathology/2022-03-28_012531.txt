patients with adrenal insufficiency are unable to increase production. Adrenal crisis (eg,
hypotension, shock) is rapidly fatal if unrecognized.

Adrenal insufficiency can be caused by dysfunction of either the adrenal glands (primary) or
pituitary (secondary). This patient's concomitant skin hyperpigmentation is highly suggestive
of chronic primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI), as the resulting cortisol deficiency leads to
increased ACTH secretion. ACTH is derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC), the same
prohormone from which melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) is derived. Increased ACTH
also leads to increased MSH secretion, which results in hyperpigmentation.

Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause (>90%) of chronic PAI and occurs due to
autoantibody formation, resulting in atrophy of the bilateral adrenal glands. It can occur as
an isolated disorder or in association with other autoimmune syndromes (eg, hypothyroidism,
vitiligo).

(Choice B) Bilateral adrenal hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome [WFS]) can
cause PAI and adrenal crisis but is typically seen acutely in the setting of bacterial sepsis (eg,
Neisseria meningitidis). However, hyperpigmentation occurs in chronic adrenal insufficiency
and therefore would not be expected with WFS.
