affecting the face, groin, and extremities. Over time, small erythematous papules coalesce to
form large, indurated plaques with a central clearing that often appears brown or bronze-
colored. Diagnosis is made by detecting elevated levels of glucagon in the serum.

(Choice A) Glucagon acts on the liver to promote amino acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis
from amino acids. Circulating levels of amino acids are low in glucagonoma and thought to
contribute to development of necrolytic migratory erythema.

(Choice B) Elevated gastrin levels in patients with gastrinoma are associated with
hypersecretion of gastric acid and resultant gastrointestinal ulceration. The peptic ulcers that
occur with gastrinomas are often in unusual areas, such as the jejunum. Patients with
gastrinomas can also have diarrhea and abdominal pain.

(Choice D) Excess somatostatin secretion from a somatostatinoma typically presents with
abdominal pain, gallbladder stones, constipation, hyperglycemia, and steatorrhea. These
manifestations result from somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin, glucagon, gastrin,
secretin, and cholecystokinin secretion, and inhibition of gastrointestinal motility.

(Choice E) High levels of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) are seen in patients with a
ViPoma, which typically presents with intractable diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria.

Patients are usually hypotensive due to dehydration and the vasodilatory effects of VIP.
