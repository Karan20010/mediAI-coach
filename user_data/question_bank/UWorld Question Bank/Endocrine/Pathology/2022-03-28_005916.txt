Educational objective:

Primary adrenal insufficiency usually involves autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal
cortex. Reduced aldosterone production leads to renal salt wasting with hypovolemia,
hypotension, and hyperkalemia. The hypovolemia and reduced cortisol-induced inhibition of
antidiuretic hormone lead to water retention and hyponatremia. Reduced cortisol also causes
decreased circulating epinephrine with a compensatory increase in norepinephrine.
