levels. Adrenal androgens (eg, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione) undergo
peripheral conversion to testosterone, which explains this patient's high testosterone level.

(Choice B) Adrenal medullary hyperplasia is a precursor lesion for pheochromocytoma
characterized by increased catecholamine production. Presenting signs include hypertension,
tachycardia, and sweating (not virilization).

(Choice C) Leydig cell tumors produce excess testosterone and can present with precocious
puberty in young boys (eg, early testicular/phallic enlargement). A testicular mass is typically
palpated on examination.

(Choice D) Production of excess LH and FSH by pituitary adenomas can lead to increased
testosterone but not increased 17-OHP levels. Pituitary adenomas producing excess ACTH
can lead to excess adrenal androgen production; however, symptoms of excess cortisol
production (Cushing syndrome) such as growth deceleration and weight gain would
predominate.

(Choice E) Aseminoma is a testicular tumor most commonly found in adolescents and
adults. These tumors are derived from the seminiferous tubules and present with a testicular

mass, not virilization and elevated testosterone.
