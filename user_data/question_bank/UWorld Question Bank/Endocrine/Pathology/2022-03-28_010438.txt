This patient has primary hypothyroidism, presenting with a low serum thyroxine level and
elevated TSH, associated with fatigue and neurocognitive symptoms. Immediately preceding
this, she had symptoms suggesting hyperthyroidism (ie, palpitation, diaphoresis). In light of
her recent childbirth, this phasic pattern of thyroid dysfunction is most consistent with
postpartum thyroiditis.

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles similar to that seen in chronic lymphocytic
(Hashimoto) thyroiditis. It typically begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to release of
preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to depletion of
thyroid hormone and an eventual return to a euthyroid state.

Postpartum thyroiditis is associated with high titers of antithyroid peroxidase and
antithyroglobulin autoantibodies, which activate complement in thyroid follicles and
stimulate NK cells. Histologic inspection demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration, sometimes
with formation of germinal centers. Breakdown of follicle margins and loss of colloid may also
be seen.

(Choice A) Riedel thyroiditis is a rare disorder characterized by extensive fibrosis of the
thyroid that extends into surrounding tissues. The thyroid gland is hard and fixed.
