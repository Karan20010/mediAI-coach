an effort to maintain blood pressure.

(Choice B) Increased ADH and normal levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and norepinephrine
occur in the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). SIADH presents with
hyponatremia, but it does not explain this patient's hyperkalemia, salt craving, and orthostatic

symptoms.

(Choices C, D, and E) Elevations in aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine occur in
conditions that decrease effective arterial blood volume and renal perfusion (eg, heart failure,
cirrhosis, dehydration). Cortisol levels are often elevated in dehydration and heart failure; total
cortisol is low in cirrhosis due to reduced cortisol-binding protein levels.

(Choice F) Increased cortisol with reduced levels of aldosterone, ADH, and norepinephrine
can occur with ectopic ACTH production (eg, due to small cell lung cancer). Aldosterone
synthesis is mostly independent of ACTH and is suppressed because cortisol and other
glucocorticoids have some mineralocorticoid activity. Levels of ADH and norepinephrine are
also generally suppressed.

Educational objective:
Primary adrenal insufficiency usually involves autoimmune destruction of the bilateral adrenal

cortex. Reduced aldosterone production leads to renal salt wasting with hypovolemia
