The patient described in this vignette has type 2 diabetes mellitus (advanced age, obesity,
prolonged non-compliance with treatment without immediate life-threatening consequences).
The two cardinal defects involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus are
increased insulin resistance and defective insulin secretion. Although still controversial, many
researchers believe that increased insulin resistance is the primary abnormality in type 2
diabetes mellitus. Early in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, glucose tolerance is thought to
remain normal because of a compensatory increase in insulin secretion from beta cells. This
compensatory insulin response by beta cells ultimately fails, causing poor glucose tolerance.
A number of genetic and acquired factors are implicated in the beta-cell dysregulation of type 2
diabetes. Islet amyloid polypeptide (amylin) is one factor thought to be responsible for this
beta cell dysfunction. Amylin is stored in insulin secretory granules and is co-secreted with
insulin from pancreatic beta cells. Deposits of amylin are universally seen in the pancreatic
islets of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Amylin may play a causative role in beta cell
apoptosis and defective insulin secretion; however, this theory is still controversial.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have very strong genetic components. Twin studies have
shown a concordance rate of 50% in identical twins for diabetes mellitus type 1, and around
80% for diabetes mellitus type 2. The genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus
