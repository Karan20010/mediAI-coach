homogenous mass when imaged.

(Choice C) Gliomas can occur in the suprasellar region if they arise from the optic apparatus,
but do not appear on imaging with the three components described above. Gliomas typically
presents with visual symptoms, hypothalamic dysfunction, and hypopituitarism.

(Choice D) Meningiomas are tumors of the leptomeninges, which is the lining of the brain.
Hence, meningiomas can occur in any "lined" part of the brain including sellar and suprasellar
regions. Meningiomas are usually homogeneous appearance on MRI and can be seen
"sticking" to leptomeninges.

Educational Objective:

1. The anterior pituitary is formed from an out-pouching of the pharyngeal roof and is called
Rathke's pouch. The posterior pituitary gland arises from an extension of the hypothalamic
neurons.

2. Craniopharyngiomas are tumors arising from Rathke's pouch remnants in the anterior
pituitary. They characteristically have three components: solid, cystic, and calcified. They
present during childhood, usually, with mass effect and visual deficits.
