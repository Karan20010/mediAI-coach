Question ld: 879 Previous Next FullScreen Tatorial__Lab Values Notes
The initiation of puberty and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility
require the coordinated efforts of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. Delayed puberty

can result from a derangement anywhere in this axis.

(Choices B, C, D, and E) These pathways represent normal feedback loops between the
testes and the hypothalamus and pituitary. Pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
stimulates proliferation of the seminiferous tubules and spermatogenesis. The seminiferous
tubules produce inhibin, which feeds back to inhibit pituitary FSH secretion. Luteinizing
hormone from the pituitary stimulates the interstitial Leydig cells to produce testosterone,
which also participates in feedback inhibition.

Educational objective:

In Kallmann syndrome, there is an absence of GnRH secretory neurons in the hypothalamus
due to defective migration from the olfactory placode. These patients have central
hypogonadism and anosmia, and often present with delayed puberty.
