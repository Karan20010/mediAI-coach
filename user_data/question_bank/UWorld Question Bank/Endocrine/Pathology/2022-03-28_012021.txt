pituitary and typically occurs during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. In contrast
to Sheehan syndrome, the presentation is acute with severe headaches and visual field
defects.

(Choice D) Primary pituitary cancer is extremely rare, although the pituitary is prone to
metastases due to its rich vascular supply. These patients typically present with tumor mass
effects (eg, headache, bitemporal hemianopsia).

(Choice E) Non-malignant infiltrative lesions such as sarcoidosis and histiocytosis X mainly
involve the suprasellar region, where they compress the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk.
This disrupts the normal hypothalamic dopaminergic suppression of prolactin secretion,
leading to increased prolactin levels and possible galactorrhea. Central diabetes insipidus
may also be seen with resulting hypernatremia.

Educational objective:

High estrogen levels during pregnancy cause enlargement of the pituitary gland without a
proportional increase in blood supply. Peripartum hypotension can cause ischemic necrosis of
the pituitary leading to panhypopituitarism (Sheehan syndrome). Patients commonly develop
failure of lactation due to deficiency of prolactin.
