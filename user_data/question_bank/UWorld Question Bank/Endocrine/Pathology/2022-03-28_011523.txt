This patient has bony overgrowth (ie, frontal bossing; enlarged jaw, hands, and feet) consistent
with acromegaly. Acromegaly is caused by excessive production of growth hormone (GH)
and is most often due to a pituitary somatotroph adenoma. Excess GH both directly and
indirectly (via release of insulin-like growth factor 1 from the liver) leads to overgrowth of many
tissues, including bone, cartilage, and visceral organs.

In the heart, chronic GH elevation stimulates cardiac growth, causing left ventricular
hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction, and possible heart failure. The joints are also frequently
involved in acromegaly, as excessive GH causes hyperplasia of articular chondrocytes and
synovial hypertrophy, leading to wear and degeneration of articular cartilage and periarticular
bone (hypertrophic arthropathy). Soft tissue involvement is also common and manifests as
macroglossia, deepening of the voice (due to laryngeal soft tissue growth), carpal tunnel
syndrome, and peripheral neuropathy.

(Choices A and D) Marfan syndrome is an inherited condition caused by a defect in fibrillin-
1. Cardiovascular complications include cystic medial degeneration of the aorta (with
aneurysmal dilation and dissection), aortic regurgitation, and mitral valve prolapse. However,
unlike the bony enlargement in acromegaly, the typical marfanoid habitus is characterized by a
tall, slender build and an increased ratio of limb length-to-height.
