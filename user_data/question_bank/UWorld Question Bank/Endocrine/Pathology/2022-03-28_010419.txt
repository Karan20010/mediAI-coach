Educational objective:

Neuropathic foot ulcers can occur in diabetic patients when loss of pain sensation and
proprioception delays recognition of injury due to trauma, friction, or sustained pressure (on
plantar surface of foot bones). The risk is greatest in patients with longstanding diabetes who
have poor glycemic control.
