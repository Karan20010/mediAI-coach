This patient has delayed puberty plus anosmia, consistent with a diagnosis of Kallmann
syndrome. Kallmann syndrome results from a failure of GnRH-secreting neurons to migrate
from their origin in the olfactory placode (situated outside the central nervous system) to their
normal anatomic location in the hypothalamus. Most often, the cause is a mutation in the KAL-
1 gene or the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 gene, which code for proteins required in this

migration.

Patients with Kallmann syndrome classically have central hypogonadism and anosmia,
although there may be other midline defects as well (eg, cleft lip or cleft palate). Most often,
these patients present with delayed puberty. On physical examination, the testes are often just
1-2 mL in volume. There is usually some pubic hair because adrenarche occurs normally.

In the United States, delayed puberty is defined as the absence or incomplete development of
secondary sexual characteristics by age 14 in boys and by age 12 in girls. Testicular
enlargement is the first sign of puberty in boys, and breast enlargement is the first sign in girls.
The initiation of puberty and the maintenance of secondary sexual characteristics and fertility
require the coordinated efforts of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and gonads. Delayed puberty
can result from a derangement anywhere in this axis.
