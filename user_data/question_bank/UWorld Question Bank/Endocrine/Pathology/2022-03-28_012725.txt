This patient's symptoms are concerning for a pituitary tumor. Large pituitary tumors can
cause headaches due to mass effect, and compression of the optic chiasm by suprasellar
extension of the tumor can lead to bitemporal hemianopsia.

The most common type of pituitary adenoma is a prolactinoma. Prolactin is a peptide
hormone secreted from lactotrophs of the pituitary gland whose primary physiologic action is
maintenance of lactation in postpartum women. Hyperprolactinemia also suppresses GnRH
production in the hypothalamus, leading to oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and infertility.
Suppression of ovulation is also seen as a physiologic effect of breastfeeding, which supports
elevated prolactin levels for 6 months or more postpartum.

(Choice A) Kallmann syndrome is a disorder involving the GnRH-producing neurons in the
hypothalamus. In addition to decreased sense of smell (anosmia/hyposomia), this condition
causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and presents with short stature and delayed puberty
(primary amenorrhea). This patient has secondary amenorrhea (ie, normal initial onset of
puberty followed by menstrual dysregulation), and her bilateral temporal visual deficits are
more suggestive of a pituitary rather than hypothalamic lesion.

(Choice B) Ovarian granulosa cells produce estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin. Loss of
