A 30-year-old man comes to the office with a neck lump. The patient is otherwise
asymptomatic and discovered the nodule incidentally while showering. His medical history is
significant for a recently diagnosed pheochromocytoma, which was successfully removed.
The patient's father died of thyroid cancer in his 30s. An ultrasound reveals a hypoechoic 3-
cm nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid gland. Fine-needle biopsy of the nodule is consistent
with a subtype of thyroid cancer. The patient undergoes total thyroidectomy with central neck
dissection. Which of the following is the most likely histological finding?

A. Branching structures with interspersed calcified bodies (13%)

B. Follicular hyperplasia with tall cells forming intrafollicular projections (11%)
SY C. Nests of polygonal cells with Congo red-positive deposits (58%)

D. Pleomorphic giant cell nests with occasional multinucleated cells (6%)

E. Sheets of uniform cells forming small follicles (9%)
