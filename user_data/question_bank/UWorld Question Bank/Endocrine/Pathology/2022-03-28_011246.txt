Several studies have shown that diabetes mellitus is one of the strongest risk factors for

coronary heart disease. Cardiovascular mortality is increased by 2- to 4-fold in patients with

type 2 diabetes mellitus, and approximately 40% of patients die secondary to coronary heart

disease. For a person with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk of dying from coronary heart

disease exceeds the risk of dying from any of the other listed causes, even in the absence of

other major risk factors for coronary heart disease.

(Choice A) The risk of breast cancer is not increased in patients with diabetes mellitus.
Although this patient has a family history of breast cancer, her risk is not significantly increased
since her mother was at an advanced age when the cancer occurred.

(Choice B) Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hyperosmolar coma are acute complications of
untreated diabetes mellitus. Hyperosmolar coma is seen mainly with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and is characterized by very high blood sugar levels without ketoacidosis. The mortality of
hyperosmolar coma is higher than DKA; however, very few patients with diabetes die directly
from DKA or hyperosmolar coma.

(Choice D) Diabetes mellitus is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD),
followed by hypertension. However, approximately 50% of patients with ESRD die due to
cardiovascular disease, with infections being the next most common cause.
