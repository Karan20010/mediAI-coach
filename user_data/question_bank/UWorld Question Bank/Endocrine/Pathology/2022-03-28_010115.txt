yielding proinsulin. In the secretory granules, proinsulin is cleaved into insulin and C-peptide,
which are then released together in equimolar amounts. Normally, as blood glucose falls,
endogenous insulin secretion is suppressed, and serum levels of both insulin and C-peptide
drop.

Hypoglycemia due to excessive endogenous insulin production is associated with elevated
levels of C-peptide. This can occur due to autonomous insulin-producing tumors
(insulinomas) or intake of insulin secretagogues (eg, sulfonylureas). Self-induced
hypoglycemia via oral hypoglycemics is often a manifestation of a factitious disorder and is
typically seen in health care workers and family members of patients with diabetes using these
medications (which is likely in this patient whose husband has home glucose-testing

supplies). Sulfonylurea abuse can be confirmed by testing the urine or blood for specific
hypoglycemic agents.

(Choice A) Glucagonoma is a rare tumor of pancreatic alpha cells that secretes excessive
amounts of glucagon. This results in hyperglycemia, weight loss, anemia, and necrolytic
migratory erythema (a raised, erythematous rash affecting the face, groin, and extremities).

(Choice B) Hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin injection, which does not contain C-
peptide, is associated with an elevated serum insulin level but an undetectable C-peptide level.
