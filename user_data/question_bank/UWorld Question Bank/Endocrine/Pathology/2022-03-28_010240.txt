Educational objective:

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea and
occurs due to decreased amplitude and frequency of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing
hormone release from the hypothalamus, which in turn leads to low FSH, LH, and estrogen
levels. Causes include anorexia nervosa (eg, distorted body image, restricted diet, lanugo),
excessive strenuous exercise, and chronic illness.
