apoptosis and adetective Insulin secretion; nowever, this theory Is still controversial.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have very strong genetic components. Twin studies have
shown a concordance rate of 50% in identical twins for diabetes mellitus type 1, and around
80% for diabetes mellitus type 2. The genes involved in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus
type 2 remain largely unknown. Gene polymorphism within the major histocompatibility
complex contributes to type 1 diabetes mellitus disease in humans. HLA-DQ and -DR are the
most important determinants of type 1 diabetes mellitus. In the general population, DR3 and
DR4 are seen in approximately 40% of subjects; however, in patients with type 1 diabetes
mellitus, DR3 and DR4 haplotypes are seen in more than 90% of subjects.

(Choices A, C, D & E) These are features of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 1 diabetes occurs
when an autoimmune response is triggered by an environmental insult in genetically
susceptible individuals. Patients with type 2 diabetes retain at least some beta cell function,
but patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus develop absolute deficiency of insulin secondary to
immune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. These patients need insulin for survival.
Discontinuation of insulin treatment results in ketoacidosis.
