neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Although an increased incidence of pancreatic endocrine
tumors has been reported in both VHL and NF1, these associations are much less frequent
than in MEN1.

(Choices B and E) MEN2A consists of medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and
primary hyperparathyroidism. MEN2B (also known as MENS) is associated with medullary
thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, and a marfanoid habitus. The MEN2
syndromes are not associated with pancreatic endocrine tumors.

Educational objective:

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 consists of hyperparathyroidism (eg, hypercalcemia,
constipation, kidney stones), pituitary tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (eg,
gastrinoma). The genetic defect involves mutations of the MEN1 gene.
