more consistent with MEN 2B than Marfan syndrome. In addition, unlike true Marfan
syndrome, patients with MEN 2B do not develop aortic malformations (eg, dilation) or ocular

malformations (eg, ectopia lentis).

(Choice C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant condition
characterized by parathyroid adenomas with hyperparathyroidism, anterior pituitary gland
tumors, and pancreatic endocrine tumors (the "3 Ps"). MEN 1 is not associated with thyroid
cancer or perioral nodules.

(Choices E and F) Neurofibromatosis type 1 is characterized by café au lait spots, cutaneous
neurofibromas, axillary or inguinal freckling, optic glioma, and iris hamartomas.
Neurofibromatosis type 2 (the more central form) is characterized by bilateral acoustic
neuromas, brain meningiomas, and schwannomas of the dorsal roots in the spinal cord.
Although this patient has (mucosal) neuromas, the remainder of his presentation is more
consistent with MEN 2B.

Educational objective:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer,
pheochromocytoma, marfanoid habitus, and oral and intestinal mucosal neuromas.
