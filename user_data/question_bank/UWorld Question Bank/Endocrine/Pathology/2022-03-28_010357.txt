(Choice A) Although diabetic patients (especially those who smoke) often have comorbid
arterial insufficiency, arterial ulcers are typically painful, sharply demarcated, and located at the
tips of the toes. This patient has full distal pulses, which makes clinically significant
atherosclerotic disease unlikely to be the primary cause of the ulcer.

(Choice B) Bacterial infection may delay ulcer healing, especially if there is underlying
osteomyelitis, but it is not the inciting cause of neuropathic ulcers. In addition, although
diabetic ulcers are often colonized by bacteria, this patient has no fever, erythema, or purulent
drainage to suggest serious infection.

(Choice C) Irritant contact dermatitis presents with pruritic or painful erythema in areas of
exposed skin (eg, hands). It can occasionally cause small vesicles or fissures, but ulcers are
not typical.

(Choice E) Systemic vasculitic disorders (eg, polyarteritis nodosa) are an uncommon cause
of skin ulcers. Vasculitic ulcers are usually painful and associated with other skin (eg, purpura,
nodules) and systemic (eg, fever, fatigue) symptoms.

(Choice F) Ulcers caused by venous insufficiency are most common over the tibias or
proximal to the medial malleolus. They present as irregular ulcerations in the setting of stasis

dermatitis and/or varicose veins. Activate V
