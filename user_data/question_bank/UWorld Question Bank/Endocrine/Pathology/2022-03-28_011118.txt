Educational objective:

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase causes adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to excess stimulation of
the adrenal cortex by ACTH. The classic, non-salt-wasting form presents in boys age 2-4 with
early virilization, accelerated linear growth, and elevated levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone and

androgens.
