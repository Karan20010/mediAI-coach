A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 1 week history of mood swings, difficulty
concentrating, and hand tremors. She also has pain at the front of her neck that radiates to
her ears and is worse with swallowing. The patient initially attributed her symptoms to a flu-
like illness that she had a few weeks earlier. She has no other medical conditions and takes
no medications. Blood pressure is 140/80 mm Hg and pulse is 105/min. The thyroid gland is
very tender on palpation. After initial laboratory testing, a thyroid scan is performed and
reveals diffusely decreased radioiodine uptake. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is 105 mm/hr.
Which of the following pathological changes would be most likely on biopsy of this patient's
thyroid gland?

A. Branching papillary structures with interspersed calcified bodies (2%)

B. Extensive stromal fibrosis extending beyond the thyroid capsule (6%)

C. Follicular hyperplasia with tall cells forming intrafollicular papillary projections (8%)
SY D. Mixed, cellular infiltration with occasional multinucleated giant cells (62%)

E. Mononuclear, parenchymal infiltration with well-developed germinal centers (19%)
