This patient's hypertension, proximal muscle weakness, and hyperglycemia are suggestive of
excess cortisol (ie, Cushing syndrome [CS]). Hypercortisolism can be confirmed by finding
elevated cortisol levels in a late-night salivary sample or 24-hour urine collection. Additionally,
low-dose dexamethasone suppression testing can also be useful for confirming the diagnosis;
administration of a small dose of a potent glucocorticoid rapidly suppresses ACTH and cortisol
secretion in normal individuals, but patients with CS are resistant to low-dose glucocorticoids

so serum cortisol remains elevated. Activate Windows
