Question Id: 1844
This patient has a marfanoid habitus—a tall and slender build with disproportionately long
arms, legs, and fingers. The flesh-colored nodules on his lips and tongue are likely mucosal
neuromas, which are unencapsulated, thickened proliferations of neural tissue. This patient
also has a history of total thyroidectomy, which was likely due to medullary thyroid cancer
(MTC). This combination of clinical findings is consistent with multiple endocrine neoplasia
type 2B (MEN 2B), which is due to an autosomal dominant germ-line mutation in the RET
proto-oncogene.

Other possible manifestations of MEN 2B include pheochromocytoma and intestinal
ganglioneuromas (which may cause constipation). The earliest manifestations of the disease
often appear in childhood or adolescence. Early recognition of MEN 2B is important as almost
all patients develop MTC and prophylactic thyroidectomy can be life-saving.

(Choice A) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a heritable connective tissue disorder characterized by
skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, tissue fragility, poor wound healing, and easy
bruising. There is no known association between Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and thyroid cancer
or perioral nodules.

(Choice B) Although this patient has a marfanoid habitus, the remainder of his presentation is

more consistent with MEN 2B than Marfan syndrome. In addition, unlike true Marfan
