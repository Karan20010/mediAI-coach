This patient has chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis presenting with
hypothyroidism (eg, fatigue, weight gain, constipation) and a diffuse goiter. This
autoimmune disease occurs predominately in women, has a peak incidence at age 45-65, and
is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in iodine-sufficient regions such as the United
States.

In all forms of primary hypothyroidism, laboratory studies show low serum thyroxine (T4) levels
and elevated TSH. Antithyroid peroxidase antibody levels are usually elevated, although
they are not specific to Hashimoto thyroiditis and are also seen in other autoimmune thyroid
disorders (eg, postpartum thyroiditis, Graves disease).

If the diagnosis is uncertain (eg, thyroid nodularity), a biopsy can be performed to rule out
malignancy. Characteristic findings of Hashimoto thyroiditis include a lymphoplasmacytic
infiltrate with the formation of germinal centers. Residual follicles are often surrounded by
Hurthle cells (large cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm) representing follicular epithelial
cells that have undergone metaplastic change in response to inflammation.

(Choice A) Histopathology in papillary thyroid carcinoma shows branching papillary structures
with concentric calcifications (psammoma bodies) and | ground: glass or empty: appearing nuclei
