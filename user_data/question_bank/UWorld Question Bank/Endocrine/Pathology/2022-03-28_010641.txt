patients with this germline mutation, C-cell hyperplasia is often found as a precursor to a
malignant lesion. Malignant C cells secrete calcitonin, which can form amyloid deposits within
the tumor.

(Choice B) Papillary thyroid carcinoma (the most common type of thyroid malignancy) has
distinct cytologic and histologic features. These include laminar calcifications (psammoma
bodies), large cells with pale, empty-appearing nuclei (Orphan Annie—eye or ground-glass
nuclei) with nuclear inclusion bodies and nuclear grooves. Unlike FTC, papillary thyroid
carcinoma can be diagnosed on FNA results.

(Choice C) Hurthle cells are large, polygonal cells with granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm due
to large quantities of mitochondria. They are a nonspecific finding seen in a wide variety of
neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions. Therefore, they would not be of benefit in
differentiating between benign and malignant follicular lesions.

(Choice D) Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis typically presents with signs of
primary hypothyroidism (eg, weight gain, cold intolerance, elevated TSH) due to autoimmune
destruction of the thyroid gland. Histology shows inflammation and lymphocytic germinal

centers in the thyroid gland.
