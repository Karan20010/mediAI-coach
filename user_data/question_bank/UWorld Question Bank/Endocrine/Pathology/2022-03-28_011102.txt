*Also called simple virilizing form.

Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
and leads to impaired conversion of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol.
Excess 17-OHP is shunted away from cortisol synthesis toward androgen production. ACTH
increases due to the decline in cortisol levels and has a trophic effect on adrenal cortical cells,

causing adrenal cortical hyperplasia.

Depending on the residual enzyme activity, 21-hydroxylase deficiency can present as 3 distinct
clinical syndromes of differing severity. This patient most likely has the classic, non-salt-
wasting (ie, simple virilizing) form of the disease. Because 21-hydroxylase is not completely
absent (as in the most severe form), sufficient mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids are
maintained to avoid salt wasting such that patients have normal blood pressure and
electrolytes. Due to adrenal androgen overproduction, girls with this variant are often
identified at birth due to ambiguous genitalia. Boys appear normal at birth and typically
present around age 2-4 with early virilization (eg, body odor, pubic/axillary hair). Exposure to
high levels of sex hormones also induces an early pubertal growth spurt that manifests as
accelerated linear growth at a young age.

In all forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency, patients have increased 17-OHP and androgen
