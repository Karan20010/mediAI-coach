amounts of glucagon. This results in hyperglycemia, weight loss, anemia, and necrolytic
migratory erythema (a raised, erythematous rash affecting the face, groin, and extremities).

(Choice B) Hypoglycemia due to exogenous insulin injection, which does not contain C-
peptide, is associated with an elevated serum insulin level but an undetectable C-peptide level.

(Choice C) Somatostatinoma is a rare tumor of pancreatic delta cells that is associated with
hyperglycemia, weight loss, abdominal pain, steatorrhea, cholelithiasis, and hypochlorhydria.
These manifestations are due to somatostatin-induced inhibition of insulin, gastrin, secretin,
and cholecystokinin secretion, as well as decreased gastrointestinal motility.

(Choice E) ViPomas are non-beta cell pancreatic islet cell tumors that hypersecrete
vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). Features include watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and
impaired gastric acid secretion.

Educational objective:

Hypoglycemia is characterized by tremor, diaphoresis, and confusion in association with a low
blood glucose level and resolution of symptoms when the blood glucose level is corrected.
Hypoglycemia with elevated insulin and low C-peptide levels suggests exogenous insulin
injection, whereas elevated C-peptide suggests an insulin secretagogue or insulin-secreting

tumor. ctivate V
