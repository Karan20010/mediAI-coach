This patient's right coronary artery (RCA) shows significant occlusion by a large atheromatous
plaque with a soft, yellow, lipid core composed mainly of cholesterol and cholesterol esters.
Presumably, this patient died from a complication of advanced atherosclerosis, such as a
myocardial infarction. His father's similar fate at a young age suggests a familial condition,
most likely familial hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most
common inherited disorders, and results from autosomal dominant mutations of the LDL
receptor gene.

The liver LDL receptor is normally the greatest contributor to the removal of cholesterol-
containing IDL and LDL particles from the circulation. Although numerous other cell types,
including smooth muscle cells, adrenocortical cells, fibroblasts, and lymphocytes also express
high-affinity LDL receptors, approximately 70% of the plasma LDL is normally cleared by the
liver. Heterozygotes with one mutant LDL receptor gene have a 2- to 3-fold elevation of
plasma cholesterol from birth, due to reduced hepatic IDL and LDL uptake. Homozygotes may
have a 5- to 6-fold elevation. In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, the progression of
atherosclerosis with aging is accelerated. Complications include coronary artery disease at an
unusually young age, as was the case for the patient in the vignette.

(Choices A, B, D, E and F) Although many cell types express the LDL receptor, their rate of
