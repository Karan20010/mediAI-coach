Educational objective:

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles. It begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to release
of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a transient hypothyroid phase due to depletion of
thyroid hormone. Histologic inspection demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration, sometimes with

formation of germinal centers.
