LDL = low-density lipoprotein; VLDL = very low-density lipoprotein.

This patient has familial chylomicronemia syndrome (type 1 hyperlipoproteinemia), an

autosomal recessive condition most often caused by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency.

LPL is normally bound to heparan sulfate moieties on the vascular endothelium, allowing it to

interact with chylomicrons and VLDL in the circulation and release free fatty acids into the

adjacent tissues. Heparin administration releases these endothelium-bound lipases, allowing

LPL activity to be measured in the laboratory. Without sufficient LPL activity, the body is

unable to clear dietary lipid loads due to defective hydrolysis of serum triglycerides (especially

chylomicrons).

Patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome present in childhood with marked

hypertriglyceridemia, recurrent acute pancreatitis, lipemia retinalis (milky-appearing

retinal vasculature), and eruptive xanthomas (small yellowish papules surrounded by erythema

found mainly on extensor surfaces).
