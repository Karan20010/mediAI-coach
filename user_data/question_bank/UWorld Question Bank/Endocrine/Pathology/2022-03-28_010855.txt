(Choice B) Crystal deposition arthritis typically presents initially with acute inflammatory
monarthritis at the first metatarsophalangeal joints and knees (gout), or knees, wrists,
shoulders, and elbows (pseudogout [ie, calcium pyrophosphate deposition arthritis]). These
disorders would not cause facial changes or hypogonadism.

(Choice C) Sarcoidosis is characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in
various tissues. Sarcoid arthropathy often occurs acutely in association with erythema
nodosum and hilar adenopathy (Lofgren syndrome); chronic arthritis is less common and
usually occurs in patients with significant pulmonary disease.

(Choice E) Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) involves a complex inflammatory response, culminating
in an influx of monocytes that differentiate into inflammatory macrophages in the synovium.
RA commonly presents with chronic swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints but does not
cause enlargement of the supraorbital ridges or jaw.

Educational objective:

Acromegaly can affect the joints in both the axial and the appendicular skeleton. Excessive

growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 cause hyperplasia of articular chondrocytes

and synovial hypertrophy, leading to later degeneration of articular cartilage and periarticular

bone. ctivate V
