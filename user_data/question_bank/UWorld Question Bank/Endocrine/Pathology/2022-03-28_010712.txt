(Choice E) Multinucleated giant cells are seen in many thyroid conditions, including
thyroiditis, cystic degeneration, and papillary thyroid carcinoma. They are not typically seen in
follicular lesions.

Educational objective:

Follicular neoplasms typically present as slowly enlarging, painless thyroid nodules.
Differentiation between a follicular adenoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma is not possible
using only fine-needle aspiration results. Histologic evidence of invasion of the tumor capsule
and/or surrounding blood vessels is needed to diagnose follicular thyroid carcinoma.
