This patient has signs of panhypopituitarism with failure of lactation, central hypothyroidism,
and adrenal insufficiency. In the setting of a recent delivery, this most likely represents
ischemic necrosis of the pituitary gland (Sheehan syndrome). During pregnancy, the
pituitary enlarges due to estrogen-induced hyperplasia of the lactotrophs. However, the blood
supply to the pituitary does not increase proportionally. As a result, the enlarged pituitary is
vulnerable to ischemia in case of systemic hypotension due to peripartum hemorrhage
(which this patient likely experienced given her low hemoglobin).

The most common manifestation of Sheehan syndrome is failure of lactation due to prolactin
deficiency. It also commonly causes hypocortisolism and hypothyroidism. Manifestations of
thyroid deficiency may take a few weeks to develop due to the long circulating half-life of
thyroxine (5-7 days) and peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Cortisol deficiency
manifests rapidly, however, with nausea, postural hypotension, fatigue, and weight loss.

(Choice A) Pituitary apoplexy is due to sudden hemorrhage into the pituitary, usually in the
setting of a preexisting pituitary adenoma. It usually presents with acute severe headache,
ophthalmoplegia, and altered sensorium.

(Choice B) Lymphocytic hypophysitis is the most common inflammatory condition of the
pituitary and typically occurs during late pregnancy or the early postpartum period. In contrast
