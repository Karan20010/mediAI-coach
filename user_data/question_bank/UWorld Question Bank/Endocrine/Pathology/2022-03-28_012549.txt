5 (Choices C and D) Ischemic necrosis of the pituitary (Sheehan syndrome) most commonly

7 occurs due to hypoperfusion of the enlarged pituitary gland during childbirth. Acute pituitary

8 hemorrhage (pituitary apoplexy) typically occurs in patients with pituitary adenomas. These

40 conditions can cause central (secondary) adrenal insufficiency; however, hyperpigmentation is

at not seen because ACTH levels are low, and POMC levels are not increased.

13 (Choice E) Acortisol-producing adrenal tumor can cause contralateral adrenal atrophy due to

= suppression of ACTH secretion; however, it would not be associated with hyperpigmentation
+ [16 and would manifest as hypercortisolism rather than adrenal insufficiency.

18 Educational objective:

= Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is characterized by weight loss, abdominal pain, fatigue,

21 and hyperpigmentation. Physiologic stress in patients with PAI can trigger acute adrenal crisis
. , (eg, fever, shock, mental status changes). Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause
+ 24 of PAI and leads to bilateral adrenal atrophy.
