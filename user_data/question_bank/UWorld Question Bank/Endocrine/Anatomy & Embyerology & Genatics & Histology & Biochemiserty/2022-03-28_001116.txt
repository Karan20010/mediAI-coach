: (Choice D) In the hexose monophosphate shunt, glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-
6 phosphogluconolactone by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),
z generating the reducing equivalent NADPH. G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic anemia
9 during times of increased oxidative stress.
© (Choice E) Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under
Qe anaerobic conditions. Excess lactate forms in hypoxic states, causing metabolic acidosis.
: Educational objective:
16 In hyperglycemic states, aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol at a rate faster than
= sorbitol can be metabolized. Sorbitol accumulates in certain cells such as lens cells, causing
19 an influx of water and resulting in osmotic cellular injury. Depletion of NADPH by aldose
