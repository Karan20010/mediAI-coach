order to undergo beta-oxidation in mitochondria. Although beta-oxidation of fatty acids is
increased in diabetic ketoacidosis, the resulting acetyl-CoA is used for energy and ketone body

formation (not glucose production).

(Choice C) In contrast to fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in mitochondria, fatty acid
synthesis occurs in the cytosol. Acetyl CoA generated in mitochondria during glycolysis is
transferred to the cytosol as citrate. In the cytoplasm, ATP citrate lyase converts citrate back
into acetyl CoA that can be used for fatty acid chain elongation.

(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is the first enzyme of the hexose
monophosphate (HMP) shunt. The HMP shunt produces pentose sugars for nucleotide
synthesis and NADPH, which is necessary for cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis.

Educational objective:
Glycerol produced by the degradation of triglycerides in adipose tissue can be used by glycerol
kinase in the liver and kidney to synthesize glucose during gluconeogenesis.
