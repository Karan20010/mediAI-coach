This patient has diabetes insipidus (Dl), a condition that results in the production of large
volumes of very dilute urine due to impaired antidiuretic hormone (ADH) activity. DI can be
due to deficient ADH production in the brain (central) or resistance to ADH in the kidneys
(nephrogenic). Injection of exogenous ADH can help distinguish between central and
nephrogenic DI: ADH administration substantially increases urine osmolality in patients
with central DI, whereas patients with nephrogenic DI typically have a more limited increase in

urine osmolality (<300 mOsm/L increase).

ADH is synthesized by magnocellular neurosecretory cells in the paraventricular and
supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. These neurons project axons to the posterior pituitary
where axon terminals store large quantities of ADH for later release into the circulation. Injury
to the hypothalamus or posterior pituitary (eg, head trauma, transsphenoidal neurosurgery,
suprasellar masses) can result in central DI. Damage to the more distal portions of the
hypothalamic-hypophyseal tract (ie, below the infundibulum) typically causes transient DI
because the cell bodies of the magnocellular neurons remain intact. However, hypothalamic
injury results in death of the magnocellular neurons, causing permanent central DI.

(Choice A) The anterior pituitary produces ACTH, TSH, gonadotrophic hormones, prolactin,
and growth hormone. Hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary is regulated by
