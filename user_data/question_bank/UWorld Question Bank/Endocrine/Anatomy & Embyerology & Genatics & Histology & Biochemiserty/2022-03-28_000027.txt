Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine metabolism. Deficiency of
homogentisic acid dioxygenase blocks homogentisic acid metabolism, preventing the
conversion of tyrosine to fumarate. Homogentisic acid accumulates in the body and is
excreted in the urine, imparting a black color to the urine if allowed to sit and undergo
oxidation. In patients with alkaptonuria, the retained homogentisic acid selectively binds to
collagen in connective tissues, tendons, and cartilage. This leads to "ochronosis," a blue-
black pigmentation most evident in the ears, nose, and cheeks, and ochronotic arthropathy,

which typically manifests during adulthood.

(Choice A) Leucine is a branched-chain amino acid that is elevated in maple syrup urine
disease. Isoleucine and valine are also increased. Impaired metabolism of these amino acids
leads to cerebral edema, seizures, and a sweet smell of the urine.

(Choice B) Conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine is defective in phenylketonuria and

usually occurs due to a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase. Undiagnosed and untreated
phenylketonuria results in significant intellectual disability not seen in this patient.

(Choice C) Impaired renal cystine (a homodimer of cysteine) transport leads to cystinuria, a
disease characterized by flank pain, hematuria, and renal stones in childhood or adolescence.
