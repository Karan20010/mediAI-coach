(Choices A and E) Familial chylomicronemia syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by defective lipoprotein lipase activity with increased synthesis and decreased
clearance of chylomicron particles (and VLDL to a lesser extent). It can also be due to ApoC2
deficiency because lipoprotein lipase is activated by ApoC2 on chylomicrons and VLDL.

(Choice B) ApoA1 is required for esterification of free cholesterol in HDL particles by lecithin-
cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). ApoA1 and LCAT deficiencies result in low HDL levels and
increased circulating free cholesterol levels.

(Choice D) Familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased levels of LDL
cholesterol. It is caused by defects in the ApoB/E LDL receptor or ApoB-100 ligand, leading to
decreased hepatic clearance of LDL.

Educational objective:

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is caused by defects
in ApoE3 and ApoE4, leading to decreased clearance of chylomicrons and VLDL remnants.
Patients can develop eruptive and palmar xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis.
