Niemann-Pick disease is an autosomal recessive disorder common among Ashkenazi Jews
and is characterized by sphingomyelinase deficiency. Sphingomyelinase is responsible for
the breakdown of sphingomyelin, a lipid constituent of cell membranes. In Niemann-Pick
disease, sphingomyelin accumulation within lysosomes results in cells that appear
enlarged, foamy, and vacuolated on electron microscopy. These lipid-laden foam cells
accumulate in the liver and spleen and cause hepatosplenomegaly. Progressive neuronal
accumulation is responsible for hypotonia and neurologic degeneration (eg, failure to
progress developmentally, loss of milestones). Retinal accumulation leads to a cherry-red

macular spot.

This patient is presenting with the classic infantile type A variant that results in
hepatosplenomegaly, progressive neurologic deterioration, and death by age 3 years.

(Choice A) In patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, central nervous system
accumulation of cerebroside sulfate is caused by arylsulfatase A deficiency. Central and
peripheral demyelination leads to peripheral neuropathy and ataxia.

(Choice B) In Krabbe disease, galactocerebrosidase deficiency causes accumulation of
galactocerebroside and psychosine. Infants have developmental delay and/or regression,
axial hypotonia, limb stiffness, optic atrophy, and seizures.
