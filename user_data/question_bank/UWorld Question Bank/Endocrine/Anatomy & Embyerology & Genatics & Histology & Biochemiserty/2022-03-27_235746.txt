Insulin decreases blood glucose levels by increasing glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and
adipocytes. In addition to having glucose lowering effects, insulin is an anabolic hormone that
promotes synthesis of glycogen, triglycerides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Furthermore,

insulin inhibits glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

The surface receptor for insulin is a transmembrane protein with intrinsic tyrosine kinase
activity in its cytoplasmic domain. Insulin binding activates tyrosine kinase, leading to
phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1). IRS-1 then activates several
intracellular pathways that induce the physiologic effects of insulin. Activation of the MAP
kinase pathway promotes mitogenic functions such as DNA synthesis and cell growth. In
contrast, activation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) stimulates metabolic functions
such as translocation of GLUT-4 to the cell membrane, glycogen synthesis, and fat
synthesis. PI3K promotes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatase, an enzyme
that dephosphorylates glycogen synthase, leading to its activation.

(Choice A) Janus kinase (JAK) is a component of the second messenger system for various
peptide hormones (eg, growth hormone, prolactin) and cytokines (eg, interferon, interleukin).
JAK has tyrosine kinase activity; however, it is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is not part of a cell

surface receptor (non-receptor tyrosine kinase).
