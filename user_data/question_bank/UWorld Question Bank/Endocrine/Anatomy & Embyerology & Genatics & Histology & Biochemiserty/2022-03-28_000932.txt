This patient has developed hypoglycemia secondary to increased levels of an endogenous
hormone. Hypoglycemia can develop due to insulin excess (either endogenous [eg,
insulinoma] or exogenous [eg, inadvertent overdose, surreptitious insulin/secretagogue use])
as well as deficiency of counterregulatory hormones (eg, glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol).

Insulin lowers plasma glucose by increasing glucose uptake in fat, muscle, and liver. In
addition, insulin causes an increase in glycolysis by activating phosphofructokinase-2
(PFK2), the enzyme that produces fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. The intracellular concentration
of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is the major regulator of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1), which
converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in the rate-limiting step of
glycolysis. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate stimulates PFK1 while inhibiting the reverse enzyme,
fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. As a result, the rise in fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels caused
by insulin leads to an increase in glycolysis and inhibition of gluconeogenesis, with a
corresponding decrease in circulating glucose levels.

(Choice A) Insulin promotes the storage of glucose by inhibiting glycogen phosphorylase
(breaks down glycogen into glucose-6-phosphate) and stimulating glycogen synthase
(incorporates UDP-glucose into glycogen).

(Choices B, D, and E) Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose 6-phosphate by
