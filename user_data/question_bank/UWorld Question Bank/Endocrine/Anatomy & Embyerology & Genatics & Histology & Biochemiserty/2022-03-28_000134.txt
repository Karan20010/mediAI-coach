This patient with a 45,XO karyotype has Turner syndrome. Individuals with this condition are
typically treated with growth hormone (GH) when growth failure becomes evident, leading to

normalization of height in most patients.

GH promotes growth by acting on the cell surface receptors that stimulate production of
insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), primarily in the liver. One GH molecule binds to 2
receptors on the cell surface, leading to activation of Janus kinase (JAK), a nonreceptor
tyrosine kinase. JAK subsequently phosphorylates several tyrosine residues in the
intracellular domain of the GH receptor. These phosphorylated tyrosine residues function as
docking sites for STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription). Once STAT is
recruited to the receptor, it is also phosphorylated by JAK. STAT then dimerizes and
translocates to the nucleus, where it induces /GF-1 gene transcription by binding to the
promoter region. Other molecules that use the JAK-STAT pathway include cytokines (eg,
interferon) and hematopoietic growth factors (eg, erythropoietin, G-CSF).

(Choice A) Steroid and thyroid hormones bind to intracellular receptors. Once these
receptors are activated, they subsequently bind to the promoter region of target genes to
modify transcription.

(Choice B) Several hormones (eg, PTH, ACTH, TSH, ADH [V2 receptor]) activate adenylyl
