Item 23 of 31
a V7 Mark

An 18-year-old girl with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus comes to the emergency

department after several hours of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient reports

that she is on vacation visiting friends and has not taken insulin in the last 2 days. Physical

examination shows breath with fruity odor and dry mucosal membranes. Laboratory studies

show a blood glucose level of 452 mg/dL and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis is

positive for ketones. It is determined that the patient's insulin deficiency is causing increased

production of gluconeogenic precursors that are subsequently converted to glucose in the

liver. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to provide these precursor substrates?

YE. Glycerol kinase (19%)

A. Acetyl CoA carboxylase (41%)
B. Acyl CoA synthetase (25%)
C. ATP citrate lyase (4%)

D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (8%)
