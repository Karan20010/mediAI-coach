Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate helps control the balance between gluconeogenesis and
glycolysis through inverse regulation of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) and fructose 1,6-
bisphosphatase. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates PFK-1, the main regulatory enzyme
involved in glycolysis, which converts fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. The
opposite reaction (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) occurs in
gluconeogenesis and is catalyzed by the enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (inhibited by
fructose 2,6-bisphosphate).

The interconversion of fructose-6-phosphate and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is achieved by a
bifunctional enzyme complex composed of PFK-2 (increases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels)
and fructose 2,6-bisphosphosphatase (decreases fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels). Insulin
causes activation of PFK-2, leading to increased fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels and
augmented glycolysis. High concentrations of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate also inhibit
gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased conversion of alanine and other gluconeogenic
substrates to glucose.

(Choice A) Fatty acid synthesis is upregulated by insulin and high citrate levels (which
increase when acetyl-CoA is abundant, as with active glycolysis). Therefore, fatty acid
synthesis is likely to be upregulated in metabolic states in which fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
