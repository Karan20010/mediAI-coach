Cortisol produced in response to ACTH increases activity of the adrenal medullary enzyme
phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, which catalyzes the conversion of norepinephrine to
epinephrine. ACTH therefore indirectly upregulates medullary epinephrine production, but
does not directly control it.

(Choice C) Aldosterone secretion from the zona glomerulosa is primarily regulated by
angiotensin II and extracellular potassium levels.

(Choice D) Epinephrine released by the adrenal medulla acts on adrenergic receptors in the
heart, lungs, liver, and skeletal muscle to increase sympathetic tone and mediate the acute
stress response.

(Choice E) Most sympathetic postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine to activate
adrenergic receptors on the target tissues. However, the preganglionic fibers innervating the
adrenal medulla (and the postganglionic neurons innervating eccrine sweat glands) release
acetylcholine.

Educational objective:
Chromaffin cells are modified neuroendocrine cells derived from the neural crest. Chromaffin
cells in the adrenal medulla are stimulated by acetylcholine released by sympathetic
