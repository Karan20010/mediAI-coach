Stress hyperglycemia is a transiently elevated blood glucose level in the context of severe
illness in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus. It is common in the intensive care unit
and is typically seen in those with sepsis and other severe infections, burns, trauma, or major
hemorrhage.

Severe metabolic stress is associated with increased production of cortisol, catecholamines
IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon act on the liver to

into the blood.

In addition, the release of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with increased expression
of glucose transporter (GLUT) 1 in the CNS and macrophages, along with decreased
expression of GLUT4 (which mediates insulin-induced glucose uptake in peripheral tissues).
This facilitates increased glucose uptake by the brain and immune cells responsible for
fighting infection.

(Choice A) During trauma resuscitation, most patients are given isotonic fluids (eg, normal
saline, Ringer lactate), which are unlikely to cause hyperglycemia. Even if mild fluid-induced

hyperglycemia occurs, blood glucose levels typically normalize quickly after fluid boluses.
