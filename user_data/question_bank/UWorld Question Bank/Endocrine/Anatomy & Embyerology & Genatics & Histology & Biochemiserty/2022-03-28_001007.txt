A 22q11.2 microdeletion underlies the spectrum of physical features seen in DiGeorge
syndrome (DGS). Embryologically, the neural crest fails to migrate into the derivatives of the
third (affects inferior parathyroid and thymus) and fourth (affects superior parathyroid)
pharyngeal/branchial pouches. The consequent parathyroid and thymic hypoplasia results in
hypocalcemia and T cell deficiency, respectively.

The hypocalcemia in DGS leads to increased neuromuscular excitability, which manifests as
tetany, carpopedal spasms, or seizures. Tapping on the facial nerve usually elicits twitching
of the nose and lips (Chvostek sign), and inflation of the blood pressure cuff leads to carpal
spasm (Trousseau sign). Normally, the thymic shadow is visible on a newborn's x-ray. Its
absence reflects thymic hypoplasia, which leads to T cell dysfunction and results in recurrent
viral, fungal, and protozoan infections.

Conotruncal cardiac anomalies (eg, interrupted aortic arch, truncus arteriosus) may also result
from failure of neural crest migration. If there is additional involvement of the first and second
pharyngeal/branchial pouches, patients with DGS may have features such as hypertelorism,
short palpebral fissures, micrognathia, bifid uvula, and cleft palate.

(Choice A) Failure of the anterior neuropore to close leads to neural tube defects such as

anencephaly. Neural tube defects can be prevented with maternal folic acid supplementation.
