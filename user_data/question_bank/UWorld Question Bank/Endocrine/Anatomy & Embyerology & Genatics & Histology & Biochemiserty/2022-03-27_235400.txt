(Choice E) Thyroid follicular cells are an endodermal derivative, arising from the pharyngeal
epithelium at the base of the tongue. Although the parafollicular, calcitonin-secreting C cells
were previously thought to originate from neural crest tissue, recent studies suggest that they
have an endodermal origin.

Educational objective:

Neural crests are embryological structures composed of parallel strips of cells arising from the
ectoderm at the margin of the neural tube. Structures derived from neural crest cells include
Schwann cells, odontoblasts, melanocytes, enterochromaffin cells, spinal membranes, adrenal
medulla/ganglia, laryngeal cartilage, and tracheal cartilage.
