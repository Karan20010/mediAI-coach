significant syndromes due to overproduction of peptide hormones by the RER include:
¢ Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (characterized by increased water
reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts), often abbreviated SIADH, due to overproduction
of vasopressin (Choice A)

¢ Hypoglycemia due to overproduction of insulin by certain pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors (insulinomas) (Choice B)

¢ Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastric acid hypersecretion and recurrent peptic ulcer) due to
excess secretion of gastrin from pancreatic or small intestine gastrinomas (Choice D)

¢ Galactorrhea (pathologic mammary milk production) due to a prolactin-secreting lactotroph
pituitary adenoma (Choice E)

Educational objective:

The initial step in the synthesis of steroid hormones is the conversion of cholesterol to
pregnenolone in the mitochondria. The remainder of steroidogenesis occurs in the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum. Steroid-producing cells contain a well-developed smooth endoplasmic
reticulum.
