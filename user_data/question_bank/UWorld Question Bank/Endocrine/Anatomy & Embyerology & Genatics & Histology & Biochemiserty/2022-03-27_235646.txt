home for the past 2 days. The patient's neighbor called police after phone calls were not
answered and no one opened the door. She was found awake on the bathroom floor lying in
feces and urine. The patient says she fell and injured her right hip and was unable to get up to
call for help. She did not eat or drink anything during that time. On examination, the patient
appears dehydrated and has right hip tenderness. Laboratory studies show serum glucose of
72 mg/dL and positive urine ketones. Radiographs of the right hip show a right femoral neck
fracture. Increased activity of which of the following enzymes is most likely contributing to both
the serum and urine laboratory findings?
