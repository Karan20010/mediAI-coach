medulla. Pheochromocytoma can be sporadic or associated with several familial disorders,
especially multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 (particularly likely in this patient given
his family history of hyperparathyroidism). MEN type 2 is associated with germ-line mutations
in the RET proto-oncogene and is characterized by:

¢ Pheochromocytomas

e Medullary thyroid cancer (malignancy of parafollicular C cells)

e Either parathyroid hyperplasia (MEN 2A) or mucosal neuromas and marfanoid habitus
(MEN 2B)

Neural crests are embryological structures composed of parallel strips of cells arising from the
ectoderm at the margin of the neural tube. The chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla are
derived from neural crest tissue (the adrenal cortex is derived from the mesoderm). Structures
arising from neural crest cells can be remembered with the mnemonic "SOME SALT"
(Schwann cells, odontoblasts, melanocytes, enterochromaffin cells, spinal membranes [pia
and arachnoid], adrenal medulla/ganglia, laryngeal cartilage, tracheal cartilage).

(Choices A, B, and C) Capillary endothelial cells and cardiac myocytes are mesodermal
derivatives that arise from primitive endothelium. Interstitial fibroblasts also arise from the

mesoderm.
