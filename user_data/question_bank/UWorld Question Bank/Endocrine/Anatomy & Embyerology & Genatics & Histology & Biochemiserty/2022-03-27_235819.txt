This infant has symptoms typical of maple syrup urine disease, an autosomal recessive
inborn error of metabolism due to branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex
(BCKDC) deficiency. BCKDC is a thiamine-dependent enzyme that helps breakdown the
branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine into substrates that can be used

in the tricarboxylic acid cycle.

BCKDC deficiency is neurotoxic primarily due to elevated levels of leucine. Affected infants
present in the first few days of life with progressively worsening irritability, poor feeding,
lethargy, and dystonia. The urine is characteristically described as having a maple syrup

("burnt-sugar") odor.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by the presence of elevated branched-chain amino acid
(BCAA) levels. Therapy consists of dietary restriction of BCAAs. Patients remain at lifelong
risk for neurotoxicity in the setting of intercurrent illnesses and fasting because these
conditions increase the relative rate of protein breakdown, resulting in an increased plasma
concentration of BCAAs.

(Choice A) Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder due to galactose-1-phosphate

uridyltransferase deficiency. The buildup of galactose (normally found in breast milk and
regular infant formula) leads to neonatal jaundice, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and frequently
