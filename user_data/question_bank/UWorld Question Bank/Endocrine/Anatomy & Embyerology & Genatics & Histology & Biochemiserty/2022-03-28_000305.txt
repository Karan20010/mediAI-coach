Question Id: 1889
This patient in diabetic ketoacidosis is experiencing increased triglyceride breakdown in
adipose tissue due to her insulin deficiency. Triglycerides stored in adipose tissue are
metabolized to free fatty acids and glycerol by hormone-sensitive lipase in response to low
insulin and high catecholamine levels. Adipocytes are unable to metabolize glycerol, so it is
secreted into the circulation and transported to the liver, where it is phosphorylated to glycerol-
3-phosphate by glycerol kinase. Glycerol-3-phosphate is subsequently converted by
glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), which can be
used to produce glucose through gluconeogenesis.

(Choice A) Acetyl CoA carboxylase is a biotin-dependent enzyme present in both liver and
adipose tissues. It catalyzes the first committed step in fatty acid synthesis, the conversion of
acetyl CoA to malonyl CoA.

(Choice B) Fatty acids must first be activated by acyl CoA synthetase in the cytoplasm in
order to undergo beta-oxidation in mitochondria. Although beta-oxidation of fatty acids is
increased in diabetic ketoacidosis, the resulting acetyl-CoA is used for energy and ketone body

formation (not glucose production).

(Choice C) In contrast to fatty acid oxidation, which occurs in mitochondria, fatty acid
synthesis occurs in the cytosol. Acetyl CoA generated in mitochondria during glycolysis is
