The glucose transport proteins (GLUTs) are a family of transmembrane proteins responsible
for transport of glucose across cell membranes. Of these, only GLUT-4 is responsive to
insulin. In the absence of insulin, GLUT-4 is sequestered in the cytoplasm and the cells
become less permeable to glucose. However, increasing insulin concentrations induce
translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane, facilitating glucose transport into the cell
(sample B). GLUT-4 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes,
where it facilitates insulin-mediated glucose uptake and storage.

In contrast to GLUT-4, GLUTs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are always present on the plasma membrane,
regardless of insulin levels, and are responsible for insulin-independent glucose transport
(sample A).
¢ GLUT-1 contributes to basal glucose transport in erythrocytes and at the blood-brain
barrier.
¢ GLUT-2 is present in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and at the basolateral membrane
of renal tubules and small intestinal mucosa. It plays a role in absorption of dietary
glucose, reabsorption of glucose from renal tubules, hepatic glucose regulation, and
sensitivity of beta cells to circulating glucose.
¢ GLUT-3 is involved in placental and neuronal glucose transport.
