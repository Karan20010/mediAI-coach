Question Id: 20449
(Choices C and E) Intestinal motor function is generally stimulated by the parasympathetic
nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic nervous system. Although constipation can
occur due to autonomic dysfunction from demyelination (eg, multiple sclerosis) or nerve fiber
interruption (eg, traumatic spinal cord injury), these disorders would not explain this patient's

electrolyte abnormalities.

(Choice D) Colon cancer can cause intestinal obstruction, which can interfere with the
passage of stool, and can be associated with hypercalcemia (bone metastasis); however, this
would result in PTH suppression, so it is unlikely to cause hypophosphatemia. This patient's
history of renal stones also is more consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.

Educational objective:
Hypercalcemia inhibits nerve depolarization, leading to impaired smooth muscle contraction
and reduced colonic motility. Symptoms include constipation, crampy abdominal pain, and

nausea.
