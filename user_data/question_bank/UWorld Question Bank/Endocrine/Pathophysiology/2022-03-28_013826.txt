‘ (Choice C) Patients with SIADH have inappropriately concentrated urine (generally >100
5
6 mOsm/kg) for their degree of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia with a urine osmolality of <100
7 mOsm/kg (maximally dilute urine) indicates appropriate suppression of ADH secretion (as
8
9 would be seen in primary polydipsia).

it Educational objective:
w 12 The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is characterized by low
14 plasma sodium and osmolality, inappropriately concentrated urine, and clinically normal
6 volume status (euvolemic hyponatremia). An important cause of SIADH is a paraneoplastic
16
7 effect secondary to small cell carcinoma of the lung.
