This girl with ambiguous genitalia, hypertension, and hypokalemia most likely has 11B-
hydroxylase deficiency, the second-most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
after 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

11B-hydroxylase is responsible for converting 11-deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone and 11-
deoxycortisol to cortisol. Enzyme deficiency results in the buildup of aldosterone and cortisol
precursors, which are then shunted toward adrenal androgen synthesis. In genetically female
infants, androgen excess leads to ambiguous genitalia (virilization). Although 11B-
hydroxylase deficiency inhibits aldosterone synthesis, 11-deoxycorticosterone accumulates
and acts as a weak mineralocorticoid, causing affected individuals to have hypertension and
hypokalemia.

(Choice A) 5a-reductase deficiency causes ambiguous genitalia in boys due to the defective
conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone. Girls have normal genitalia, and blood
pressure and electrolytes are unaffected.

(Choice C) 17a-hydroxylase deficiency results in impaired sex steroid and cortisol synthesis,
and increased production of mineralocorticoids. Girls are born with normal genitalia, but boys
are born undervirilized (ambiguous genitalia). Affected individuals develop hypertension and
hypokalemia (mineralocorticoid excess) and do not undergo puberty (no sex steroids).
