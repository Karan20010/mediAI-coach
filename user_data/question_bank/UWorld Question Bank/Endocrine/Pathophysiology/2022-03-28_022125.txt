The child described in the vignette is six years old and has already undergone pubertal
changes, as indicated by her Tanner staging. (Also called the sexual maturity rating, Tanner
staging is a systematic, universalized method that uses female breast and pubic hair
development to categorize development.) Precocious puberty in Caucasian females is defined
as the development of secondary sexual characters at an age less than seven years.

Young bone has several layers; their order from middle to end is diaphysis, metaphysis,
epiphyseal cartilage, and epiphysis. The epiphyseal cartilage, also called the "growth plate, is
responsible for linear growth.

Linear growth stops when the epiphyseal growth plate closes, i.e. when the epiphysis fuses
with the metaphysis. Sex steroids initially increase linear growth, but they also encourage
closure of epiphyseal growth plates. Once the growth plates have closed, linear growth is
irreversibly stopped. In normal puberty, there is a rapid increase in growth. At the end of this
pubertal growth spurt, almost 90% of the final height is achieved. Although this child is
currently taller than her peers, the excess steroids will soon cause epiphyseal growth plate
closure; hence, if this patient is not treated, she will ultimately not meet her full growth

potential.
