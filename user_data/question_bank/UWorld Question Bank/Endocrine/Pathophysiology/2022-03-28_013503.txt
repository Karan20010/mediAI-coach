(Choices C and E) ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to a cortisol-producing adrenal
adenoma is characterized by increased urinary cortisol excretion with suppressed ACTH
levels. Exogenous glucocorticoids also cause suppression of ACTH, but with decreased
production (and urinary excretion) of cortisol. Low cortisol excretion and ACTH levels are also
seen in central adrenal insufficiency. Because ACTH is low in these states, patients do not
have hyperpigmentation or hyperandrogenic features (eg, hirsutism).

(Choice D) Polycystic ovary syndrome is characterized by excessive ovarian production of
androgens. Common clinical features include oligo/amenorrhea, obesity, and hirsutism.
However, ACTH and cortisol production are unaffected, and hyperpigmentation is not seen.

Educational objective:

Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. Excess
ACTH secretion in ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome leads to hyperpigmentation. In
addition to increased cortisol production, ACTH stimulates production of adrenal androgens
(eg, testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) leading to hirsutism and menstrual
irregularities.
