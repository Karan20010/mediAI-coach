above). Graves ophthalmopathy occurs in a similar manner, with expansion of the retro-orbital
tissues displacing the globe forward (proptosis). Because these processes are directly related
to TRAD, they have a high specificity for Graves disease.

(Choices A, B, C, and E) Hyperthyroidism also causes a hypermetabolic/hyperadrenergic
state that can present with heat intolerance, tremor, lid lag, tachycardia, or atrial fibrillation. In
addition, increased bone turnover can lead to osteoporosis and increased fracture risk.
However, these findings are not mediated by TRAb and can be seen in hyperthyroidism of any
cause (eg, thyroiditis, toxic multinodular goiter).

Educational objective:

Pretibial myxedema and Graves ophthalmopathy are specific features of Graves disease.
They are caused by an autoimmune response directed against the TSH receptor that results in
the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans within the affected tissues.
