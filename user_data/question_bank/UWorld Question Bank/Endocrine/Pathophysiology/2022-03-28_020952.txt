decarboxylase inhibitor used to decrease the rate of facial hair growth.

(Choice C) Patients with PCOS who develop diabetes mellitus are usually treated with
metformin, which increases insulin sensitivity. Metformin can also help normalize menses but
would not improve hirsutism.

(Choices D and E) Testosterone receptor antagonists (eg, spironolactone) are effective in
suppressing androgen-dependent hair growth. 5-a-reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride)
decrease peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT but are less effective than testosterone
receptor antagonists in treating hirsutism. Both are strongly teratogenic.

Educational objective:

Male-pattern hair growth in a woman is called hirsutism; the most common cause is polycystic
ovary syndrome. Combination oral contraceptive pills can treat hirsutism by suppressing
pituitary LH secretion and subsequently decreasing ovarian androgen production.
