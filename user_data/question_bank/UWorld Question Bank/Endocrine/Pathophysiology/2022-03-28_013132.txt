Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by excessive aldosterone secretion, typically as a result
of bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa or an aldosterone-producing adrenal
adenoma. Clinical findings include hypertension, low plasma renin activity, hypokalemia, and

metabolic alkalosis.
