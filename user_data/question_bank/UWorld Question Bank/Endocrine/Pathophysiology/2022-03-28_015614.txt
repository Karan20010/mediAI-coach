Like most hormones, secretion of cortisol is regulated via a negative feedback loop.
Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is secreted by the hypothalamus in response to stress
and circadian signals received from other parts of the central nervous system. CRH stimulates
ACTH release by the pituitary, which in turn increases cortisol secretion by the adrenal cortex.
High cortisol levels suppress secretion of ACTH and CRH, and low cortisol levels cause an
increase in ACTH and CRH secretion.

Although not commonly used, the metyrapone stimulation test is a sensitive indicator of
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis integrity. Metyrapone blocks cortisol synthesis by
inhibiting 11-B-hydroxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol in the zona
fasciculata. Because 11-deoxycortisol lacks glucocorticoid activity, it does not inhibit pituitary
ACTH secretion. As a result, the reduction in cortisol levels following metyrapone
administration cause an increase in pituitary ACTH secretion. This leads to increased
production of 11-deoxycortisol, which is further metabolized by the liver to 17-
hydroxycorticosteroids that accumulate in the urine.

Serum 11-deoxycortisol and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels will normally rise in

response to metyrapone, indicating an intact HPA axis. Failure of these steroid levels to
increase implies primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency, which can be distinguished based
