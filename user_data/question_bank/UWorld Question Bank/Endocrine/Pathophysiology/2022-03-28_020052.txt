(Choice A) Pheochromocytoma is an adrenal medullary tumor that occurs commonly in
MENZ2A and 2B. However, this patient's visual field defect suggests a pituitary tumor, which is
more characteristic of MEN1 (not associated with pheochromocytoma).

(Choice B) Primary bone tumors are not increased in MEN1, although malignant
neuroendocrine tumors may occasionally metastasize to bone.

(Choice C) The major inherited syndromes associated with breast cancer include BRCA7 and
BRCA2 mutations (breast, ovarian, uterine/fallopian tube, pancreatic cancers). Less common
syndromes include Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Peutz-Jeghers
syndrome. Hyperparathyroidism and pituitary tumors are not prominent manifestations of any
of these syndromes and are more consistent with MEN1.

(Choice D) Familial adenomatous polyposis is associated with an increased risk of colon
cancer and with adrenal adenomas and thyroid cancer.

Educational objective:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome is characterized by tumors of the pituitary,
parathyroid gland, and pancreas (the "3 Ps").
