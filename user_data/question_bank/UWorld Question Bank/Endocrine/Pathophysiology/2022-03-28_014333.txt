This young patient has both clinical (eg, polyuria, polydipsia, volume depletion) and
biochemical (eg, hyperglycemia, low bicarbonate, high anion gap, decreased serum sodium
levels) signs of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is often precipitated by infections, including
urinary tract infections (likely in this patient). Patients with DKA lose significant amounts of
potassium in the urine, primarily via glycosuria-induced osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia-
mediated increase in aldosterone secretion. This results in a total body potassium deficit
that is reflected by decreased intracellular potassium stores (since 98% of the body's
potassium is stored intracellularly). Despite the low intracellular potassium levels,
extracellular potassium concentrations are normal or increased due to the following
mechanisms:

1. Loss of intracellular free water caused by increased plasma osmolality leads to
extracellular movement of potassium secondary to increasing intracellular potassium
concentration

2. Lack of insulin also causes extracellular shifting of potassium as insulin normally promotes
cellular uptake of potassium
