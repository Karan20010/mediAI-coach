Educational objective:

Postpartum thyroiditis occurs within 12 months of pregnancy and is characterized by
autoimmune destruction of thyroid follicles. It typically begins with a hyperthyroid phase due to
the release of preformed thyroid hormone, followed by a hypothyroid phase due to depletion of
thyroid hormone and an eventual return to a euthyroid state. Histologic inspection
demonstrates lymphocytic infiltration with the formation of germinal centers, which is similar to
chronic lymphocytic (Hashimoto) thyroiditis.
