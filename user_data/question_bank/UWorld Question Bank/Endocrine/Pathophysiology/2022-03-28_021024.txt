*Drugs that increase the estrogen/testosterone ratio are associated with gynecomastia.
Gynecomastia is the abnormal development of glandular breast tissue in males. It is
characterized by ductal epithelial hyperplasia with fibrosis of the surrounding stroma. Breast
growth is inhibited by androgens and promoted by estrogens; conditions that cause increased

estrogen/androgen ratio can lead to gynecomastia.

This patient, who did not respond to first-line therapy (ie, tamsulosin, an alpha-adrenergic
antagonist) for benign prostatic hyperplasia, has likely been prescribed a 5-alpha reductase
inhibitor (eg, finasteride, dutasteride). These medications block conversion of
testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, which has a higher affinity for the testosterone
receptor and mediates most testosterone effects (including prostatic hyperplasia).

However, the excess testosterone is then converted to estrogen (eg, estradiol) by
aromatase in various tissues (eg, adipose, bone), leading to gynecomastia. Both the
beneficial effects and potential gynecomastia of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors develop slowly
and are generally not apparent in the first several months of therapy.

(Choice A) Androgen receptor antagonists (eg, flutamide, bicalutamide) are competitive
inhibitors that block the binding of androgens in target tissues; these agents are widely used in
