adrenal insufficiency, as may be seen in autoimmune adrenalitis or bilateral adrenal
hemorrhage/infarction. These patients will also have mineralocorticoid deficiency and are at
very high risk for adrenal crisis.

(Choice C) Increased CRH with decreased levels of ACTH and cortisol suggest a pituitary
disorder. ACTH is secreted by corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary; damage to the
pituitary by a tumor, infarction, or infection can cause decreased release of ACTH, which in
turn leads to decreased cortisol production.

(Choice D) Excessive cortisol production from an autonomous adrenal adenoma suppresses
CRH and ACTH production by the hypothalamus and pituitary, respectively.

Educational objective:

Suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis by glucocorticoid therapy is the most
common cause of adrenal insufficiency. In these patients, adrenal crisis can be precipitated by
stressful situations (eg, infections, surgery) if the glucocorticoid dose is not increased
appropriately.
