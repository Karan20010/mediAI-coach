This patient likely has the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
(SIADH), the most common cause of hyponatremia following subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH). Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is normally released by the hypothalamus and posterior
pituitary in response to elevated serum osmolality (eg, following water deprivation) or
decreased arterial blood volume. ADH promotes renal water reabsorption, which leads to
concentration of the urine, extracellular fluid volume expansion, and lowering of serum
osmolality and serum sodium. Hypothalamic damage following SAH is thought to trigger
excessive production of ADH, resulting in the classic SIADH features of hypotonicity (ie,
low serum osmolarity), hyponatremia, and persistently concentrated urine (ie, high urine

osmolality).

In addition to SIADH, hyponatremia after SAH can also be due to cerebral salt wasting
(caused by increased secretion of brain natriuretic peptide, which leads to urinary sodium
losses) or acute cortisol deficiency (eg, from pituitary injury, leading to hypotension) (Choice
E). In both conditions, decreased extracellular fluid volume causes a secondary increase in
ADH and worsening hyponatremia.

(Choice A) In primary polydipsia, defective central thirst regulation leads to excessive water
intake and hyponatremia. ADH levels are low, rather than high. Primary polydipsia is typically
