ultimately results in increased sodium excretion by the renal tubules, which limits net sodium
retention and prevents the development of overt volume overload and significant

hypernatremia.

(Choices A and B) Pheochromocytomas are catecholamine-secreting tumors arising from the
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal sympathetic chain, and typically
present with severe hypertension. Pheochromocytomas stimulate the renin-angiotensin
system due to high circulating catecholamine levels, and are associated with tachycardia and
symptoms of catecholamine excess (eg, sweating, palpitations, headache).

(Choice C) Increased renin production by the juxtaglomerular apparatus leads to
hypertension with elevated aldosterone levels. This typically occurs in the setting of renal
artery stenosis with decreased renal blood flow. However, this patient's renin activity is

suppressed.

(Choices D and F) Hypersecretion from cells of the zona fasciculata or zona reticularis would
lead to Cushing syndrome or hyperandrogenism, respectively. Cushing syndrome can cause
hypertension and hypokalemia but is usually associated with weight gain and a Cushingoid
body habitus (eg, central obesity, moon facies).
