(Choice D) Muscle biopsy is often needed for diagnosis of inflammatory myositis (eg,
polymyositis, dermatomyositis). However, this patient has symptoms suggestive of
hypothyroidism (eg, weight gain, bradycardia, brittle nails), and histologic findings in
hypothyroid myopathy are often nonspecific.

Educational objective:

Hypothyroid myopathy presents with myalgias, proximal muscle weakness, elevated creatine
kinase levels, and delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes. The diagnosis can be
confirmed with an elevated TSH level. Other common causes of myopathy with elevated
creatine kinase levels include inflammatory myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors.
