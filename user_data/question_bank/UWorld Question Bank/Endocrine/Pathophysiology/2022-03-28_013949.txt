(Choices A and B) Excess cortisol production due to an autonomously functioning adrenal
adenoma, adrenal carcinoma, or primary adrenocortical hyperplasia will cause Cushing
syndrome with a suppressed ACTH level (ACTH independent). This patient's ACTH is
elevated.

(Choice C) Administration of exogenous glucocorticoids is a common cause of Cushing
syndrome. This is most common with systemic agents (eg, prednisone), but can occasionally
be seen with topical or inhaled glucocorticoids. However, ACTH is suppressed in these cases.

Educational objective:

In Cushing syndrome due to an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease), ACTH
is high and cortisol production can be suppressed by high-dose, but not low-dose,
dexamethasone. In patients with ectopic ACTH production (eg, from malignant tumors),
cortisol and ACTH production are not suppressed by low- or high-dose dexamethasone.
