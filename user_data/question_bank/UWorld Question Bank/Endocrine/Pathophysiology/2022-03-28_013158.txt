circulating free fatty acids and glycerol that can be utilized as gluconeogenetic substrates.

(Choice C) During the first 12 hours of fasting, hepatic glycogenolysis is the source for most
of the body's glucose. When hypoglycemia is sustained, gluconeogenesis in the renal cortex
becomes an important glucose source. Epinephrine is more effective than glucagon in
stimulating renal gluconeogenesis.

(Choice E) Glucagon and insulin are pancreatic hormones that act as key blood glucose
regulators. Insulin decreases blood glucose levels and suppresses glucagon secretion.
Although it sounds counterintuitive, glucagon stimulates insulin secretion by acting on the
pancreatic beta cells (allowing glucose to be taken up by insulin-sensitive tissues).

(Choice G) The treatment of choice in hypoglycemic patients without an altered sensorium is
to administer glucose orally as glucose is a monosaccharide that gets absorbed rapidly from
the gastrointestinal tract.

Educational objective:

Glucagon increases serum glucose by increasing hepatic glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Glucagon also stimulates insulin secretion from the pancreas. Unlike
epinephrine, glucagon has an insignificant effect on glucose homeostasis in the skeletal

muscle, adipose tissue, and renal cortex. Activate V
