on plasma ACTH levels.

(Choices B and D) The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system regulates aldosterone
synthesis by the zona glomerulosa. Because metyrapone inhibits 11-8-hydroxylase,
aldosterone synthesis will decrease. However, accumulation of the aldosterone precursor 11-
deoxycorticosterone (a weak mineralocorticoid) prevents the development of mineralocorticoid
deficiency, so renin levels will not change significantly.

(Choice C) The inhibition of 11-8-hydroxylase by metyrapone would lead to a decrease in
cortisol, not an increase.

(Choice E) Vasopressin is a hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary that is responsible for
regulating water balance. Additionally, vasopressin acts as a potentiator for CRH, enhancing
the release of ACTH. However, there is no clear feedback loop between cortisol and
vasopressin; therefore, metyrapone administration is unlikely to lead to vasopressin
overproduction.

Educational objective:
Administration of metyrapone will cause a decrease in cortisol synthesis via inhibition of 11-B-
hydroxylase. In patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, this will cause a

reactive increase in ACTH, 11-deoxycortisol, and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels. Activate Windows
