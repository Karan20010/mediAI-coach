inhibitors that block the binding of androgens in target tissues; these agents are widely used in
metastatic prostate cancer but not for treating BPH.
(Choices B and C) Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that inhibits enzymes in the steroid
hormone biosynthetic pathway, reducing testosterone synthesis. Spironolactone is an

aldosterone receptor antagonist that also decreases testosterone synthesis in addition to
cross-inhibition of the androgen receptor. Both drugs also can displace estrogen from plasma
binding proteins and raise free estrogen levels, but neither is used in BPH.

(Choice E) Pituitary prolactin secretion is under negative regulation by dopamine. Dopamine
receptor antagonists (eg, antipsychotic medications) facilitate increased prolactin release and
can occasionally cause galactorrhea. The resulting hyperprolactinemia can also suppress
release of FSH and LH, leading to central hypogonadism (and rarely gynecomastia).

Educational objective:

5-alpha reductase inhibitors (eg, finasteride, dutasteride) are used in the treatment of benign
prostatic hyperplasia. They block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; the
excess testosterone is then available for conversion to estrogens (eg, estradiol) by aromatase,
which can lead to gynecomastia.
