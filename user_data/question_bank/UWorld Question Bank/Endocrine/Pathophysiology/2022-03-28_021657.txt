This patient's symptoms (eg, weight loss, tachycardia, and tremors), elevated free thyroxine
(T4), and suppressed TSH are indicative of thyrotoxicosis. However, her thyroid is small and
serum thyroglobulin is undetectable, which suggests an exogenous source of thyroid
hormone. Thyroglobulin is a glycoprotein produced by thyroid follicular cells that makes up a
substantial component of follicular colloid and serves as the substrate for the formation of
thyroid hormone. A small amount is released by the thyroid in normal function. Low levels, as
in this patient, suggest noninflammatory suppression of thyroid activity.

In light of her mother's hypothyroidism, which suggests a possible source of levothyroxine
tablets, this patient is likely surreptitiously taking thyroid hormone in an attempt to lose weight.
Exogenous thyrotoxicosis can also occur in patients taking over-the-counter supplements
containing animal thyroid tissue and in erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy.
Excess T4 supplementation suppresses TSH, which decreases iodine organification and
colloid formation resulting in atrophy of thyroid follicles.

(Choice B) Histopathology in chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto) thyroiditis is characterized by
a mononuclear infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and plasma cells, often with germinal
centers. Hashimoto thyroiditis typically presents with primary hypothyroidism (elevated TSH,
low free T4) and goiter; although Hashimoto's can occasionally present with an initial
