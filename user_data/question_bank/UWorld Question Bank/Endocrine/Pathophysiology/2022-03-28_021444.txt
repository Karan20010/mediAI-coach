This patient most likely has gigantism, a condition caused by hypersecretion of growth
hormone (GH) during childhood. GH is a peptide hormone secreted by the anterior pituitary
that acts as both a growth promoter and stress hormone (increasing glucose and free fatty
acid levels). Although GH has direct effects on target tissue (eg, chondrogenesis, myocyte
protein synthesis), its growth-promoting effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1), which is released from the liver following stimulation of hepatic GH
receptors. IGF-1 binds to a specific receptor tyrosine kinase and stimulates cell growth and
proliferation in bone, cartilage, skeletal muscle, and other soft tissues.

Gigantism occurs in children and adolescents before fusion of the epiphyseal growth plates,
resulting in rapid linear growth along with large hands and feet, thickening of the calvarium,
protrusion of the jaw (prognathism), excessive sweating, and oily skin. The adult variant,
acromegaly, has no effect on stature because the epiphyseal growth plates have already
fused.

(Choices A and B) Klinefelter syndrome is caused by a nondisjunction of sex chromosomes
(47,XXY). Patients are phenotypically male with hypogonadism and infertility. Marfan
syndrome is caused by a defect in fibrillin-1 and presents with joint hypermobility, increased
limb length, and arachnodactyly. These disorders are associated with tall stature but do not
