limb length, and arachnodactyly. These disorders are associated with tall stature but do not
exhibit prognathism or bony enlargement of the hands and feet.
(Choice C) Defects in the GH receptor cause Laron dwarfism, characterized by decreased
linear growth, high serum GH concentrations, and low levels of circulating IGF-1.

(Choice E) Excessive thyroxine production (ie, hyperthyroidism) presents with weight loss,
heat intolerance, and tremor. Sweating is common, but hyperthyroidism in children causes
short stature, not accelerated growth.

(Choice F) Circulating levels of IGF-1 are produced primarily in the liver. Although IGF-1 is
also produced locally in the hypothalamus to regulate central nervous system activity, this
source does not contribute significantly to bone and soft-tissue growth.

(Choice G) Increased pituitary gonadotropin release causes central precocious puberty. This
patient has appropriate sexual development for age.

Educational objective:

Gigantism is caused by excess growth hormone (GH) during childhood and is characterized by
accelerated linear growth, prognathism, and bony enlargement of the hands and feet. GH
excess after closure of the epiphysial growth plates causes acromegaly. GH has direct effects
