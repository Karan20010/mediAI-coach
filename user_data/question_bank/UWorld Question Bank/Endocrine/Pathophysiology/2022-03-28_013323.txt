This patient's symptoms are worrisome for a pituitary tumor. Large tumors can cause
headaches due to mass effect, and compression of the optic chiasm by suprasellar extension
of the tumor can cause bitemporal hemianopsia. These tumors can also cause loss of
normal pituitary function by compression of surrounding cells. Pituitary adenomas typically
arise from 1 of the 5 major cell types of the anterior pituitary; physiologic symptoms depend on
the hormones produced by the tumor. The most common hormonally active (functional)
adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas (prolactinomas).

Prolactin is a peptide hormone whose primary action is maintenance of lactation in the
postpartum period; prolactinomas classically cause galactorrhea in premenopausal women.
Prolactin also suppresses GnRH production from the hypothalamus, which in women leads to
amenorrhea and in men causes hypogonadism (eg, impotence, decreased libido, infertility).
Because the symptoms of hyperprolactinemia in men and postmenopausal women are often
mild and nonspecific, patients may not seek care until the tumors are large and cause mass
effect symptoms.

(Choices B, D, and F) Somatotroph (growth hormone-secreting) adenomas can present with
gigantism (in children) or acromegaly in adults. Thyrotroph (TSH-secreting) adenomas cause
