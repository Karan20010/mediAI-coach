A 29-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive headaches, fatigue, and visual
disturbances for the past 6 weeks. He was diagnosed with sarcoidosis a year ago after having
a dry cough and hypercalcemia. The patient's condition was treated with oral glucocorticoid
therapy, which was discontinued after 6 months due to improvement in symptoms. Physical
examination reveals bitemporal defects on visual field testing but is otherwise normal.
Laboratory studies again show mild hypercalcemia, but the remainder of the values, including
complete blood count, serum glucose, creatinine, and electrolytes, are within normal reference
ranges. MRI of the brain reveals a soft tissue mass involving the hypothalamus and pituitary
stalk. Which of the following pituitary hormones is most likely elevated in this patient?

© A. ACTH
