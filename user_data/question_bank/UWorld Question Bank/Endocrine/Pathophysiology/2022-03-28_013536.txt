(Choice D) Parathyroid adenomas (or carcinomas) cause primary hyperparathyroidism
resulting in hypercalcemia. Characteristic symptoms include constipation, abdominal pain,
bone pain, and neuropsychiatric symptoms.

(Choice E) Toxic nodular thyroid disease could produce this patient's symptoms (eg,
diaphoresis, weight loss). However, metabolically active thyroid adenomas typically show a
follicular structure, with uniform cells and large amounts of follicular colloid.

Educational objective:

Pheochromocytoma is a tumor arising from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla
characterized by excess production of catecholamines. Clinical features include episodic
hypertension, diaphoresis, and palpitations. Microscopic examination of the tumor cells shows
electron-dense, membrane-bound secretory granules, and immunohistochemistry is positive
for synaptophysin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase.
