This patient has features of hypercortisolism, including hypertension, central obesity, muscular
weakness, ecchymoses, and hyperglycemia. She most likely developed iatrogenic Cushing
syndrome due to prolonged administration of glucocorticoids for management of systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE). Chronic glucocorticoid use can also cause osteonecrosis, and
both Cushing syndrome and SLE itself can increase the risk for atherosclerosis and acute
coronary events (as in this patient).

Exogenous glucocorticoid use inhibits the entire hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,
leading to low levels of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), ACTH, and endogenous
cortisol. ACTH exerts a potent trophic (ie, growth promoting) effect on the adrenal zona
fasciculata and reticularis; long-term suppression leads to adrenocortical atrophy (the zona
glomerulosa is spared as angiotensin II is its primary trophic hormone). Sudden cessation of
glucocorticoids after prolonged use can precipitate adrenocortical insufficiency and adrenal
crisis.

(Choice A) Endogenous Cushing syndrome can be caused by an autonomous cortisol-
producing adrenal tumor. However, this patient's history is more suggestive of exogenous
glucocorticoid use.

Choices C, D, and E) Bilateral cortical hyperplasia and hypertrophy occurs in patients with
