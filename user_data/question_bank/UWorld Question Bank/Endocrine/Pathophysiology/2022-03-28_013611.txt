progesterone to 17-OHP, resulting in low 17-OHP, cortisol, and adrenal androgen production.
In contrast to this case, hypertension and hypokalemia occur with 17 alpha-hydroxylase
deficiency due to increased mineralocorticoids.

(Choice C) Adrenal steroid synthesis is also impaired with primary adrenal insufficiency (ie,
Addison disease); however, autoimmune destruction of the adrenal glands is unlikely to occur
in the first week of life, making 21-hydroxylase deficiency a much more likely cause of adrenal
crisis in this patient.

(Choice E) An ACTH-secreting tumor causes increased synthesis of cortisol and its
precursors (eg, 17-OHP). Cushing disease is rare in newborns and would be associated with
glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (not hypotension) and subsequent inhibition of
aldosterone.

Educational objective:

Classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency causes decreased cortisol and aldosterone production with

increased adrenal androgen production. In boys, this deficiency presents 1-2 weeks after birth
with vomiting, hypotension, hyponatremia, and hyperkalemia due to salt wasting; genitalia are

normal. In girls, it presents at birth with ambiguous genitalia.
