Educational objective:

Exogenous hyperthyroidism is characterized by elevated free thyroxine (T4), suppressed TSH,
and low/undetectable thyroglobulin. It can occur with surreptitious levothyroxine misuse,
animal-sourced thyroid supplements, and erroneous dosing of thyroid replacement therapy.
Over time, the lack of TSH stimulation causes the thyroid follicles to become atrophic.
