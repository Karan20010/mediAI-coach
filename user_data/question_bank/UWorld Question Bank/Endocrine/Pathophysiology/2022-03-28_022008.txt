This patient with sarcoidosis has a hypothalamic and pituitary stalk mass with mass-effect
symptoms (eg, headache, bitemporal visual field defects). In combination with the recurrent
hypercalcemia (caused by excessive calcitriol formation by activated macrophages) 6 months
after the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy, this presentation suggests active
sarcoidosis with involvement of the hypothalamus (neurosarcoidosis). Although sarcoidosis
classically causes noncaseating granulomas involving the lungs, lymph nodes, and skin,
granulomas can form in any tissue.

Mass lesions in the hypothalamus or pituitary stalk can disrupt the hypothalamic-pituitary axis
by obstructing the hypophyseal portal system. Unlike other pituitary hormones, prolactin
release is negatively regulated by dopamine produced in the hypothalamus. Dopamine acts
on the dopamine D2 receptors of lactotrophs, the prolactin-producing cells of the pituitary.
Disruption of dopaminergic pathways (eg, by an infiltrating sarcoid lesion) in the pituitary stalk
leads to loss of inhibition and a subsequent increase in prolactin.

(Choices A, B, and D) Pituitary adenomas can cause excess hormone formation; however,
this patient has a hypothalamic mass, not a pituitary adenoma. In contrast to prolactin, other
pituitary hormones (ACTH, growth hormone, thyrotropin [TSH], LH, and FSH) are inhibited by
hypothalamic lesions because the dominant effect of the hypothalamus on them is stimulatory.
