of exogenous androgen, these patients have a low sperm count because local androgen
concentrations in the seminiferous tubule are suboptimal for spermatogenesis. Over time, this
leads to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and soft, small testes.

(Choice E) Normal LH and testosterone, elevated FSH, and a low sperm count can be seen
in patients with cryptorchidism. In this condition, the seminiferous tubules are damaged
(resulting in elevated FSH levels), and the interstitial Leydig cells are preserved (maintaining
normal LH and testosterone levels).

Educational objective:

Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY) causes infertility characterized by primary hypogonadism
(elevated FSH and LH, low testosterone) and azoospermia. Other findings include long lower
extremities; small, firm testes; and gynecomastia.
