growth and increased deposition of glycogen and fat in developing tissues (Choice A).

(Choice C) Hypoglycemia due to impaired hepatic glycogenolysis is characteristic of certain
glycogen storage diseases (eg, von Gierke disease, Cori disease), which typically present
within the first several months of life with failure to thrive, ketotic hypoglycemia, and
hepatomegaly (ie, protruding abdomen) due to increased hepatic glycogen content.

(Choices D and E) Critically ill infants may produce increased cortisol due to stress (eg,
sepsis, mechanical ventilation) with resultant hyperglycemia. Insulin resistance, which is not
typically seen in infants but is related to obesity in children and adults, also causes
hyperglycemia. However, this neonate is hypoglycemic.

Educational objective:

Neonatal hypoglycemia is common in infants of diabetic mothers. The pathophysiology
involves maternal hyperglycemia, which in turn causes fetal hyperglycemia and compensatory
hyperfunctioning of the pancreas (ie, hyperinsulinemia). After birth, persistently elevated
insulin levels lead to transient hypoglycemia.
