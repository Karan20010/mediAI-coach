Question Id: 226

A 60-year-old man is brought to the emergency department due to altered mental status. His
wife says that he had a nagging cough that seemed to worsen over the past several months
and that he began experiencing occasional dizziness earlier this week. Over the last couple of
days, the patient has become increasingly confused, and today he "does not make any sense
at all." He has no significant past medical history but has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for
the last 40 years. On physical examination, the patient is incoherent but has an otherwise
normal neurologic examination.
