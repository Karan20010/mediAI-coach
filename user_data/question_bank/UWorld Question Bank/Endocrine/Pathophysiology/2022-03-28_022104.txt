Educational objective:

The thyroid releases thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine [T4]) in response to
TSH from the pituitary, which is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the
hypothalamus. Thyroid hormone suppresses the secretion of TSH and TRH via negative
feedback, and small changes in thyroid hormone levels cause large changes in TSH. Serum

TSH is the most sensitive test for primary hypothyroidism.
