(Choice A) Side-chain cleavage enzyme catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol into
pregnenolone. Lack of this enzyme leads to absent steroid hormone synthesis. Complete
enzyme deficiency is lethal due to absent placental progesterone synthesis.

(Choice B) Dehydroepiandrosterone is converted to androstenedione by 3B-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, an enzyme that also converts pregnenolone to progesterone and 17-
hydroxypregnenolone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Although deficiency of this enzyme can
result in adrenal insufficiency and ambiguous genitalia (in both sexes), it is a very rare cause
of CAH.

(Choice D) Synthesis of 17-hydroxyprogesterone from progesterone is catalyzed by 17a-
hydroxylase. Deficiency of this enzyme causes mineralocorticoid excess and impaired
androgen synthesis. Genetic males have ambiguous genitalia, whereas genetic females
appear phenotypically normal.

(Choice E) 5a-reductase deficiency prevents the conversion of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for the development of male external genitalia.
Affected genetic males, not females, are born with ambiguous genitalia.
