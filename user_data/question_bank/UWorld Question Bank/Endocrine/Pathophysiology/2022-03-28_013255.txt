metabolic syndrome have increased rates of cardiovascular events and warrant careful risk
factor management.

(Choice A) Insulin suppresses gluconeogenesis and promotes glycogen synthesis in the
liver. In patients with insulin resistance, the inhibitory effect of insulin on gluconeogenesis is
reduced, leading to increased hepatic glucose production.

(Choice B) High LDL levels are an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic heart disease in
patients with diabetes, but are not directly associated with increased insulin resistance. In
contrast, insulin resistance is associated with high triglyceride and low HDL levels.

(Choice C) High urinary excretion of ketones suggests absolute insulin deficiency, as seen in
type 1 diabetes, rather than insulin resistance. Patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin
resistance typically have high circulating insulin levels that are more than adequate to
suppress ketone formation.

(Choice D) Skeletal muscle is a major repository for ingested glucose due to insulin-mediated
glucose uptake. In patients with insulin resistance, decreased glucose uptake in skeletal
muscle leads to reduced glycogen synthesis and higher blood glucose levels.
