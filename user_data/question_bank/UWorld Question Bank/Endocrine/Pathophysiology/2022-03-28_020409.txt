(Choices C and E) Many patients with MEN1 have endocrine pancreatic tumors that secrete
gastrin, leading to refractory peptic ulceration and diarrhea (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). In
rare cases, endocrine tumors of the pancreas in MEN1 secrete other hormones, such as
insulin, which can cause hypoglycemia.

(Choice D) Pituitary tumors are present in 50% of patients with MEN1. Large pituitary tumors
with suprasellar extensions are likely to cause peripheral vision loss.

Educational objective:

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B is characterized by medullary thyroid cancer,
pheochromocytomas, mucosal neuromas, and marfanoid habitus. Hyperparathyroidism is not
a feature of this syndrome.
