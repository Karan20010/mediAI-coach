(Choice B) PTH increases renal reabsorption of calcium. Despite this, hypercalciuria is
common in hyperparathyroidism because the filtered calcium load may exceed renal
reabsorption capacity. However, the local concentrations of calcium in the bone remain
elevated, and urinary calcium wasting is not a major contributor to bone loss.

(Choice C) Supraphysiologic glucocorticoid (eg, prednisone) doses can cause osteoporosis,
in part due to decreased proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursor cells. PTH
increases the differentiation of osteoblast precursors; osteoporosis occurs in
hyperparathyroidism because of a proportionally greater increase in osteoclast activity.

Educational objective:

Parathyroid hormone directly stimulates osteoblasts, leading to increased bone formation.
Expression of RANK-L on osteoblasts induces increased bone resorption via a paracrine effect
on nearby osteoclasts. Hyperparathyroidism causes increased RANK-L expression and
decreased expression of osteoprotegerin, leading to net bone loss.
