dysfunction in younger patients is more likely to be seen in hypothyroidism rather than in
hyperthyroidism.

(Choice D) The goiter seen in hypothyroidism is due to chronic thyroid stimulation by TSH.
This manifestation improves with the administration of levothyroxine (as TSH levels are
decreased) and is not seen in over-replacement.

(Choice F) Thyroid cancer is a potential long-term complication of radioiodine therapy for
hyperthyroidism.

Educational objective:

Thyrotoxicosis, whether due to endogenous hyperthyroidism or over-replacement with thyroid

fibrillation, high-output heart failure, and worsening of angina pectoris.
