This patient's findings suggest overflow incontinence, which is mainly due to impaired
detrusor contractility or bladder outlet obstruction (eg, tumor obstructing the urethra).
Patients usually develop involuntary and continuous urinary leakage when the bladder is full
and often have incomplete emptying. This patient's overflow incontinence is most likely due to
diabetic autonomic neuropathy affecting detrusor muscle innervation, which is common in type
1 diabetics.

Patients initially have infrequent urination due to loss of autonomic afferent innervation and
inability to sense a full bladder. Involvement of efferent fibers to the bladder subsequently

causes incomplete emptying. Patients can develop recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs)
and overflow incontinence with poor urinary stream and dribbling. Pelvic floor relaxation at
night combined with a full bladder can lead to nocturnal enuresis. Postvoid residual (PVR)
testing with ultrasound or catheterization can confirm inadequate bladder emptying.

(Choice A) Enlarged prostate on rectal examination may indicate either benign prostatic
hyperplasia or prostate cancer, which causes urge incontinence (bladder irritation from the
enlarged prostate) or overflow incontinence (urethral obstruction). However, these conditions
are commonly seen in older individuals (age >50-60).
