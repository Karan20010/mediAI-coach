©uWorld *IRS = Insulin receptor substrate
The insulin receptor (IR) is a tetrameric structure consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta subunits.
The alpha subunits are extracellular and provide the binding site for insulin. The beta subunits
are intracellular and contain tyrosine kinase domains that are activated when insulin attaches
to the alpha subunits. A series of downstream signaling is then triggered, starting with the
autophosphorylation of IR, phosphorylation of IR substrates 1 and 2 (IRS-1/2), and ultimately,
translocation of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) to the cell membrane.

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) is a proinflammatory cytokine that induces insulin
resistance through the activation of serine kinases, which then phosphorylate serine residues

on the beta subunits of IR and IRS-1. This inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by IR and
subsequently hinders downstream signaling, resulting in resistance to the normal actions of
insulin. Phosphorylation of threonine residues has similar effects. Catecholamines,
glucocorticoids, and glucagon can also induce insulin resistance by this same mechanism.

(Choice A) Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is inactivated via hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase.
Phosphodiesterase can thereby dampen the effects of various hormones (eg, glucagon) that
use CAMP as a second messenger. cAMP is also involved in insulin release by pancreatic
beta cells, but it does not participate in IR downstream signaling.
