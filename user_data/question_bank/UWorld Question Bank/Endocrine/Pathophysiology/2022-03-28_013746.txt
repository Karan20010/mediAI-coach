signs (eg, weight loss, fatigue). However, polyuria and polydipsia suggest diabetes rather than
acute HIV.

(Choice D) It is possible that weight loss and polyuria are due to thyrotoxicosis, but the
absence of other symptoms of thyroid disease (eg, palpitations, heat intolerance, excessive
sweating) makes this less likely.

(Choice E) Acute cystitis can cause frequent urination but the total urine volume is not
increased, and polydipsia and weight loss are more suggestive of diabetes mellitus. Although
urinalysis can detect glucosuria, it has low sensitivity for diabetes and should not be used to
confirm the diagnosis.

(Choice F) Although surreptitious drug abuse can be considered in patients with weight loss
or other unexplained symptoms, a hemoglobin A1c test is more likely to be diagnostic in light
of this patient's polyuria and polydipsia.

Educational objective:

Type 1 diabetes mellitus typically presents subacutely with polyuria and polydipsia
accompanied by fatigue and weight loss. The diagnosis can be confirmed with a fasting blood
glucose or hemoglobin A1c measurement.
