Cushing syndrome can be categorized as ACTH-dependent (ie, TACTH stimulating excess
cortisol production) or ACTH-independent (ie, glucocorticoid excess not caused by ACTH).
Excess ACTH secretion causes identifiable clinical findings:

¢ Hyperpigmentation: Both ACTH and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) are
derived from pro-opiomelanocortin, leading to cosecretion of alpha-MSH. ACTH also
directly stimulates the MC2R receptor on melanocytes.

e Androgenization: ACTH stimulates production of adrenal androgens (eg, (DHEAS
[dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate], androstenedione). This leads to hirsutism, menstrual
abnormalities, and oily skin.

This patient's hyperpigmentation and hirsutism are consistent with ACTH-dependent
hypercortisolism, likely due to a corticotroph pituitary adenoma (Cushing disease).

(Choice B) Primary adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased cortisol levels (and decreased
urinary cortisol excretion) with a compensatory rise in ACTH. Hyperpigmentation may be
present, but adrenal androgen production is often diminished (due to loss of androgen-
producing adrenocortical cells) and hirsutism is not present.

(Choices C and E) ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome due to a cortisol-producing adrenal ee
