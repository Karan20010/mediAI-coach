The combination of hyponatremia and a lung mass is suggestive of the syndrome of
inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). ADH is normally produced in the
hypothalamus and secreted from the posterior pituitary in response to changes in plasma
osmolality and intravascular volume. However, small cell lung carcinomas, which are
tumors of neuroendocrine origin, often release ADH independent of feedback inhibition
(paraneoplastic effect). This inappropriate secretion of ADH leads to hyponatremia, decreased
plasma osmolality, and elevated urine osmolality (which normally should be <100 mOsm/kg
given the degree of hyponatremia). The profound hyponatremia that occurs in SIADH can
cause headache, weakness, altered mental status, and seizures.

In SIADH, increased ADH causes excessive water absorption by the kidneys, leading to a
transient, subclinical hypervolemia. This mild increase in extracellular fluid volume suppresses
the renin-aldosterone axis and stimulates the production of natriuretic peptides, leading to
excretion of sodium in the urine (natriuresis). As a result, patients with SIADH have a clinically
normal extracellular fluid volume and low plasma osmolality (euvolemic hyponatremia).
Features of volume overload (eg, peripheral edema, pulmonary crackles, elevated jugular
venous pressure) are not seen (Choices A, B, and E).

Choice C) Patients with SIADH have inappropriately concentrated urine (generally >100
