This patient has features consistent with primary hyperaldosteronism (PH), a very common
cause of secondary hypertension. PH is usually due to increased secretion of

mineralocorticoids from bilateral nodular hyperplasia of the adrenal zona glomerulosa or an

idosterone-producing adrenal adenoma (Conn syndrome).

The main effect of aldosterone is to stimulate absorption of sodium and excretion of potassium

nd hydrogen ions in the renal collecting tubules. Aldosterone secretion from the zona
glomerulosa is normally regulated by angiotensin II and potassium levels. Overproduction of
aldosterone can result in sodium retention, hypertension, and feedback suppression of the
renin-angiotensin system (ie, very low renin activity). Some patients also develop metabolic

alkalosis and hypokalemia, which can be exacerbated by increased distal tubule sodium
delivery (eg, diuretics, increased sodium intake). Symptomatic hypokalemia may cause
muscle weakness, cramps, and, occasionally, rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias.

Despite the increase in sodium absorption, hypernatremia and pedal edema are rarely
observed in PH due to the phenomenon of aldosterone escape. The high aldosterone levels
lead to increased intravascular volume and therefore cause increased renal blood flow (with
resulting pressure natriuresis) and augmented release of atrial natriuretic peptide. This
ultimately results in increased sodium excretion by the renal tubules, which limits net sodium
