the hypothalamus (eg, Kallmann syndrome) or pituitary gland (eg, adenomas). LH, FSH, and
testosterone levels are all low, and spermatogenesis is impaired. Unlike in this patient, testes
in central hypogonadism are atrophic and soft (not hyalinized and firm), and gynecomastia is

uncommon because the decrease in gonadotropins reduces aromatase activity.

(Choice B) Azoospermia associated with a normal hormonal profile suggests an obstruction
along the path from the testes to the seminal fluid (eg, congenital absence of the vas deferens
in cystic fibrosis). In these patients, the testes and breasts are grossly normal.

(Choice C) Decreased LH, normal FSH, and elevated testosterone in the setting of a low
sperm count suggest exogenous testosterone use. High androgen levels suppress LH
secretion, decreasing endogenous testosterone production. Despite the high circulating levels
of exogenous androgen, these patients have a low sperm count because local androgen
concentrations in the seminiferous tubule are suboptimal for spermatogenesis. Over time, this
leads to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and soft, small testes.

(Choice E) Normal LH and testosterone, elevated FSH, and a low sperm count can be seen
in patients with cryptorchidism. In this condition, the seminiferous tubules are damaged
(resulting in elevated FSH levels), and the interstitial Leydig cells are preserved (maintaining
