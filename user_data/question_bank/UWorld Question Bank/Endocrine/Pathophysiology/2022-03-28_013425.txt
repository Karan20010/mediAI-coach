hypoglycemia due to high levels of insulin from islet hyperplasia.
(Choice C) Fetal hyperglycemia may result in increased secretion of insulin-like growth factor
2 (IGF-2) during gestation, contributing to fetal macrosomia; however, neonatal hypoglycemia
is primarily caused by hyperinsulinemia that persists after birth.

(Choice D) Growth hormone is released from the anterior pituitary gland and causes
increased insulin resistance, decreasing peripheral uptake of glucose and elevating circulating
glucose levels. Therefore, an increase in fetal growth hormone release would result in
hyperglycemia.

(Choice E) Maternal insulin is not transferred to the fetus but instead is catabolized by the
placenta. It is the fetal pancreatic production of insulin that leads to transient neonatal
hypoglycemia.

Educational objective:

Maternal hyperglycemia causes increased transplacental transfer of glucose to the infant,
resulting in fetal hyperglycemia and subsequent pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia. The
pancreatic beta cell hyperplasia causes hyperinsulinemia, leading to fetal macrosomia and
neonatal hypoglycemia.
