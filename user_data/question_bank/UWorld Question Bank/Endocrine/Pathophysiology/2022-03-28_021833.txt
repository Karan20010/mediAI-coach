are more consistent with FHA.

(Choice B) Hyperthyroidism can cause irregular menses or amenorrhea, along with weight
loss. However, this patient has no other features to suggest a thyroid disorder (eg, goiter,
temperature intolerance, diarrhea, hair loss).

(Choices D and E) The amenorrhea in patients with FHA stems from a deficiency in
hypothalamic GnRH release, rather than a problem with the pituitary or ovaries; this patient
has no other features of hypopituitarism.

Educational objective:

Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea results from loss of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing
hormone release from the hypothalamus and is caused by weight loss, strenuous exercise,
systemic illness, or abnormal eating habits. Loss of cyclic gonadotropin release leads to a
decrease in LH and FSH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn causes low circulating
estrogen levels.
