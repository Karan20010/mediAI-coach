(Choices B and C) Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is characterized by primary
hyperparathyroidism (with hypercalcemia), pituitary tumors (including prolactinoma), and
endocrine pancreatic tumors. Complications of hyperparathyroidism include osteoporosis and
kidney stones. Stomach ulcers can occur in MEN1 due to hypercalcemia or a gastrin-
producing pancreatic tumor (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome). However, most prolactinomas are
sporadic and not associated with MEN1. In addition, MEN1 is rare, and this patient's lack of a
significant family history makes it even less likely.

Educational objective:

In patients with prolactinoma, high levels of circulating prolactin suppress GnRH secretion from
the hypothalamus, leading to reduced secretion of LH and subsequent hypogonadism,
anovulation, and amenorrhea. The resulting estrogen deficiency can cause osteoporosis with
an increased risk for fragility fractures, and lead to vaginal dryness and atrophy.
