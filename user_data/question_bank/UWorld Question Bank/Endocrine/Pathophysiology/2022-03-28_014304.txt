have elevated blood and urine levels of catecholamines rather than cortisol.

Educational objective:

ACTH is the major trophic hormone of the zona fasciculata and reticularis, whereas the zona
glomerulosa is primarily regulated by angiotensin II. Excess production of ACTH causes
increased cortisol synthesis within the zona fasciculata (Cushing's manifestations) and
increased androgen production within the zona reticularis (irregular menstruation, hirsutism in

women).
