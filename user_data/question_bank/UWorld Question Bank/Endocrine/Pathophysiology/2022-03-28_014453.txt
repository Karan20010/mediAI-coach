leading to increased bone resorption, increased renal calcium reabsorption, and increased
intestinal calcium absorption (due to increased production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D). This
patient's history of renal stones also indicates hyperparathyroidism and is due to increased
urinary calcium excretion despite maximal renal tubular calcium reabsorption.

Hypercalcemia inhibits nerve depolarization by interfering with sodium movement through
voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to impaired smooth muscle contraction and
reduced colonic motility. Symptoms include constipation, crampy abdominal pain, and
nausea. Other potential gastrointestinal manifestations of hypercalcemia include acute
pancreatitis (due to increased conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin) and peptic ulcer (due to
increased release of gastrin).

(Choice B) Dyssynergic defecation is characterized by altered passage of stool through the
anorectum due to uncoordinated contraction and relaxation of pelvic floor muscles. It is often
caused by obstetric complications during vaginal delivery. However, hypercalcemia and
hypophosphatemia would not be present, and most patients have either anal sphincter
dysfunction or the absence of perianal descent (this patient's rectal tone is normal).

(Choices C and E) Intestinal motor function is generally stimulated by the parasympathetic

nervous system and inhibited by the sympathetic nervous system. Although constipation can
