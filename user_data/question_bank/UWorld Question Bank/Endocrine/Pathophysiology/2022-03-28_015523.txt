feedback to increase ACTH production, further stimulating the mineralocorticoid pathway. This
allows for the excess production of weak glucocorticoids (ie, corticosterone), preventing the
detrimental effects of low cortisol.

(Choice A) 5 alpha-reductase deficiency prevents conversion of testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone, the hormone responsible for male external genitalia development.
Affected genetic males have ambiguous genitalia at birth but develop normal secondary sexual
characteristics (eg, increased muscle mass, phallus enlargement) at puberty because these
features are testosterone dependent. Blood pressure and electrolytes are unaffected.

(Choice B) 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency causes decreased glucocorticoid synthesis and
increased production of adrenal androgens. Because the production of 11-
deoxycorticosterone (weak mineralocorticoid) is also increased, individuals with this deficiency
have features of mineralocorticoid excess (eg, hypertension, hypokalemia). However, genetic
males appear phenotypically normal.

(Choice D) 20,22-desmolase (side chain cleavage enzyme) deficiency results in impaired
synthesis of all steroid hormones with accumulation of cholesterol esters in the adrenal glands
and gonads. Complete deficiency is lethal, and partial deficiency typically presents in infancy

with signs of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia). ctivate V
