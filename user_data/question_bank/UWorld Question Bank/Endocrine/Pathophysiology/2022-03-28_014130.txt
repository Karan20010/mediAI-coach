This patient has new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which results from a
combination of insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency. The early course of
T2DM is characterized by increased insulin production and decreased sensitivity of target
organs to the effects of insulin, although insulin levels may later decline as the disease
progresses. In addition, this patient has acanthosis nigricans, which is another sign of insulin

resistance.

Insulin resistance in adipose cells hinders the antilipolytic effects of insulin, leading to lipolysis
and release of free fatty acids. In turn, chronically elevated free fatty acid levels contribute
to insulin resistance by impairing insulin-dependent glucose uptake and increasing hepatic
gluconeogenesis. Other factors that contribute to insulin resistance include obesity and a
sedentary lifestyle.

(Choice A) Absolute insulin deficiency in type 1 diabetes mellitus leads to increased
gluconeogenesis and conversion of fatty acids to ketone bodies (eg, beta-hydroxybutyrate).
Very high levels of ketone bodies are seen in diabetic ketoacidosis but are not typical in T2DM
and do not interfere with the production or actions of insulin.

(Choice B) C-peptide is secreted with insulin in equimolar amounts from pancreatic beta
cells. Patients with insulin resistance will have increased production of both insulin and C-
