This patient's symptoms (eg, fatigue, weight gain, constipation) and examination findings
suggest hypothyroidism. Vital signs typically show bradycardia and hypertension (due to
increased vascular resistance). Hypothyroidism can also cause slowed hair growth and
alterations in hair growth cycles, leading to thinning of the scalp hair and lateral eyebrows.
Slowed reuptake of calcium by the sarcoplasmic reticulum manifests as a delayed relaxation
phase of deep tendon reflexes.

Most patients with hypothyroidism have primary hypothyroidism (ie, dysfunction within the
thyroid gland). The thyroid releases thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine [T3] and thyroxine
[T4]) in response to TSH from the pituitary. In turn, TSH secretion is regulated by thyrotropin-
releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. Thyroid hormone suppresses TSH and
TRH via negative feedback, and small changes in thyroid hormone levels lead to large
changes in TSH levels. As thyroid hormone production slows, TSH secretion increases
rapidly to restore thyroid activity, often before T4 levels fall below standard laboratory
reference ranges. Therefore, serum TSH is the most sensitive marker for primary
hypothyroidism.

(Choices A and B) The 24-hour urinary cortisol assay and the dexamethasone suppression
test are used to screen for Cushing syndrome. Although this patient is hypertensive, she does
