intake and hyponatremia. ADH levels are low, rather than high. Primary polydipsia is typically
seen with certain psychiatric conditions (eg, schizophrenia) or use of psychotropic
medications. It is not commonly associated with SAH.

(Choice B) Impaired renal concentrating ability is seen in diabetes insipidus (Dl), which
occurs either due to ADH resistance (in nephrogenic DI) or decreased ADH production (in
central Dl). DI may follow cerebral injury; however, it does not cause hyponatremia. Rather,
DI results in a clinical picture opposite that of SIADH, featuring hypernatremia, increased
serum osmolality, and dilute urine (ie, low urine osmolality).

(Choice C) Inadequate dietary intake of sodium is a rare cause of hyponatremia primarily
seen in cases of chronic alcohol abuse (eg, beer potomania). SIADH is a more likely cause of

hyponatremia in this patient.

Educational objective:

Hyponatremia following cerebral injury (eg, subarachnoid hemorrhage) is commonly due to the
syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Injury to the hypothalamus leads to
increased secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which in turn leads to water retention, low serum

osmolality, and increased urinary sodium excretion.
