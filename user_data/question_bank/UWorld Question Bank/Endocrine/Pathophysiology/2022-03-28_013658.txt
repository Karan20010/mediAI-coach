This adolescent most likely has physiologic gynecomastia, a benign condition affecting
approximately half of boys during midpuberty (eg, sexual maturity ratings 2-4). Characteristic
features include unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement that is directly under the nipple-
areolar complex, is often tender, and measures <4 cm.

The mechanism of physiologic gynecomastia is likely multifactorial:

¢ Imbalance of estradiol and testosterone: During early male puberty, adrenal androgens
increase (ie, adrenarche) and are converted by aromatase to estrogens, which stimulate
growth of glandular breast tissue. Testosterone, which is produced by the testes and
inhibits the development of breast tissue, typically remains low until full maturation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. This may cause a transient estrogen excess, and
some patients may be prone to gynecomastia because of a greater local concentration of
aromatase.

Higher insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels: Boys with physiologic gynecomastia
have higher serum IGF-1, which stimulates glandular breast tissue, than those without,
resulting in a further imbalance of prostimulatory hormones.

Diagnosis is clinical, but all adolescents should also be screened for substance use (eg,
