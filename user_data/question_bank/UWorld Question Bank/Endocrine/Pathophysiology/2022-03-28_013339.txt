gigantism (in children) or acromegaly in adults. Thyrotroph (TSH-secreting) adenomas cause

central hyperthyroidism (eg, heat intolerance, tachycardia). Thinning of the skin, typically

manifesting as abdominal stria, is a characteristic feature of Cushing syndrome; when

hypercortisolism is due to a corticotroph (ACTH-producing) adenoma, it is referred to as

Cushing disease. These tumors are significantly less common than prolactinomas.

(Choice C) Mass lesions involving the pituitary stalk or posterior pituitary could cause
headaches and bitemporal hemianopsia in addition to central diabetes insipidus (due to
decreased release of antidiuretic hormone [ADH] from the posterior pituitary). However,
polyuria is typically only transient (lasting <6 weeks) because the hypothalamus is able to
bypass the pituitary and directly release ADH into the circulation.

(Choice E) Hyperpigmentation in the context of pituitary disease is typically due to
hypersecretion of ACTH, either due to a corticotroph adenoma or in response to primary
adrenal insufficiency.

Educational objective:
Pituitary tumors can present with headaches, bitemporal hemianopsia, and hypopituitarism;
the most common hormonally active (functional) adenomas are prolactin-secreting adenomas

(prolactinomas). Prolactinomas can cause galactorrhea and amenorrhea in women. In men, ctivate V
