5 not have other Cushingoid features (eg, central obesity, skin striae, proximal muscle
: weakness).
: (Choice C) Initial tests for diabetes mellitus include fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, and oral
to glucose tolerance tests. Diabetes can cause peripheral neuropathy (eg, paresthesias, loss of
= distal sensation, decreased ankle reflexes), but bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, and
13 delayed relaxation of reflexes are more suggestive of hypothyroidism.

15 (Choice D) The initial evaluation of hereditary hemochromatosis includes serum iron studies

ov (eg, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin saturation). Although pituitary dysfunction with secondary

(central) hypothyroidism can occur, patients commonly also have arthritis, diabetes mellitus,

abnormal skin pigmentation, and hepatomegaly.

(Choice E) TSH is more sensitive than either T3 or T4 for diagnosing primary
hypothyroidism. TSH is not elevated in pituitary or hypothalamic disease (ie, secondary
hypothyroidism), but this is a much less common cause of hypothyroidism (<5% of cases). In
addition, patients with secondary hypothyroidism usually have other clinical features of
hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.
