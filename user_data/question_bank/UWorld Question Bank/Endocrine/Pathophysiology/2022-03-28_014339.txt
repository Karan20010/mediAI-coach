5 Clinicians must be careful when giving insulin and intravenous fluids during resuscitation of
& dehydrated, hyperglycemic patients. These interventions force potassium back into the cells,

“a when treating a patient with DKA.
B (Choice A) A decrease in both intra- and extracellular potassium levels is seen with
14 mineralocorticoids excess, diuretic use, and chronic gastrointestinal losses.
is
16 (Choice B) Extracellular potassium concentration decreases following glucose and insulin
18 administration as potassium moves into the intracellular compartment. Stimulation of beta-
19 adrenergic receptors also causes increased transfer of potassium to the intracellular

compartment.

33 (Choice D) Renal excretion of potassium is impaired in most patients with chronic renal
24 failure, resulting in increased total body potassium storage and hyperkalemia.
25
26 (Choice E) Normal extracellular potassium levels are common in patients with DKA as the
= extracellular potassium shift is often mitigated by increased urinary potassium losses.
29 However, intracellular potassium levels are always decreased in DKA. ctivate V
