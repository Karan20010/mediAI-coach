producing adrenal tumor. However, this patient's history is more suggestive of exogenous
glucocorticoid use.

(Choices C, D, and E) Bilateral cortical hyperplasia and hypertrophy occurs in patients with
ACTH excess (eg, pituitary corticotroph adenoma [Cushing disease]). Varying degrees of
adrenocortical nodularity can also be seen. However, this patient was likely taking exogenous
glucocorticoids, which would suppress ACTH release and lead to adrenocortical atrophy.

Educational objective:

Long-term use of supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids causes suppression of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn leads to bilateral adrenocortical atrophy
involving the zona fasciculata and reticularis. Sudden cessation of the exogenous
corticosteroids can precipitate adrenal crisis.
