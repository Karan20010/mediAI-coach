with signs of adrenal insufficiency (eg, hypotension, hyperkalemia).

(Choice E) The most common form of CAH is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. It causes
decreased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis and increased adrenal androgen
production. In contrast to this patient, genetic males with 21-hydroxylase deficiency appear
phenotypically normal.

Educational objective:

Deficiency of 17 alpha-hydroxylase is a rare form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
characterized by impaired synthesis of androgens, estrogens, and cortisol with excess
production of mineralocorticoids. Genetic males with this deficiency may have phenotypically
female external genitalia and present with hypertension and hypokalemia around the expected
time of puberty.
