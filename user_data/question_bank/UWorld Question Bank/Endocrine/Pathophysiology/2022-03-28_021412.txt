thyroid hormone
¢ Diffuse swelling and decreased thyroid blood flow on ultrasound
(Choices A and B) Graves disease is caused by autoantibodies that bind and stimulate the

TSH receptor (ie, thyrotropin receptor antibodies/thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins) on
thyroid follicular cells. Toxic adenoma and toxic nodular goiter are characterized by
autonomous thyroid hormone synthesis. Because of the increased metabolic activity in these
conditions, Doppler ultrasound reveals increased, not decreased, blood flow. Radioiodine
uptake is also increased.

(Choice C) Thyrotoxicosis due to exogenous thyroid hormone use (eg, erroneous
levothyroxine dosing, surreptitious use of thyroid hormone supplements) would show
suppression of TSH and decreased blood flow in the thyroid, but goiter would not be present
(thyroid atrophy is more likely).

(Choice E) Subacute (ie, postviral/granulomatous/de Quervain) thyroiditis is thought to be due
to a viral infection in the gland or a secondary inflammatory response to viral antigens.
Patients may experience a transient hyperthyroid phase, but the thyroid gland is
characteristically painful and tender to palpation.
