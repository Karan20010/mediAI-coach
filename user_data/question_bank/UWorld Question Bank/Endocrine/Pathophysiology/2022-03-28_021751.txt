This adolescent has gynecomastia, which can be physiologic (most common in this age

group) or pathologic.

Physiologic (or pubertal) gynecomastia is caused by an imbalance of hormones that either
stimulate or inhibit the development of breast tissue. During puberty in boys, androgens
produced by the adrenal glands are peripherally aromatized to estrogens, providing a source
of stimulatory hormones that are not yet counterbalanced by adult testosterone levels. This
leads to physiologic development of breast tissue in over half of adolescent boys at Tanner
stage 3-4 that can be unilateral or bilateral, asymmetric, and tender (Choices A, C, and D).
Physiologic gynecomastia is benign and typically resolves within a year.
In contrast, clinical features that raise concern for pathologic gynecomastia include:

¢ Development before or after midpuberty (eg, Tanner stage 1 or 5)

¢ Rapid progression or size >4 cm

¢ Location eccentric to the nipple areolar complex

¢ Persistence for >3 years

This patient has no testicular enlargement or signs of adrenarche (eg, axillary hair, body odor)
and is therefore prepubertal, warranting further evaluation for a pathologic source of
