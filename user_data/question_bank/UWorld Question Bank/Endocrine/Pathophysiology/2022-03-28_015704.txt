This patient's fatigue and weight loss are likely due to primary adrenal insufficiency
(Addison disease). Type 1 diabetes mellitus is caused by autoimmune destruction of
pancreatic beta cells and is associated with an increased risk of other autoimmune
endocrinopathies. Autoimmune adrenalitis is the most common cause of primary adrenal
insufficiency and results from autoantibodies against all 3 zones of the adrenal cortex.
Because the main defect is in the adrenal gland, exogenous ACTH administration does not
increase cortisol levels. Decreased negative feedback of cortisol on the pituitary gland
increases release of ACTH and melanocyte-stimulating hormone, resulting in
hyperpigmentation. Patients with diabetes often have reduced insulin requirements due to
decreased appetite, weight loss, and increased insulin sensitivity (glucocorticoids decrease
insulin sensitivity).

Hypoaldosteronism in primary adrenal insufficiency leads to decreased Na: reabsorption and
decreased urinary excretion of K- and H-. Decreased H- excretion causes a nonanion gap
metabolic acidosis with low plasma HCO;. This leads to compensatory Cl retention to
maintain electrical neutrality of the extracellular fluid. The hypotension induced by lack of

aldosterone stimulates vasopressin release, increasing free water reabsorption and further
exacerbating hyponatremia. As a result, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency present
