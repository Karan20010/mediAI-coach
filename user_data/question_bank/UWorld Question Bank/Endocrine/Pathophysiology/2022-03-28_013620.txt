A 2-hour-old newborn has a blood glucose concentration of 30 mg/dL. The patient was
delivered via caesarean to a 32-year-old woman at 38 weeks gestation. Birth weight is 4.5 kg
(9 Ib 14 oz). The pregnancy was complicated by gestational diabetes treated with insulin.
However, glycemic control remained suboptimal due to maternal noncompliance with insulin
treatment and poor adherence to dietary recommendations. Examination of the neonate is
unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely primary mechanism responsible for
this patient's low blood glucose concentration?

A. Decreased glycogen stores (4%)
YB. Hyperfunctioning pancreas (77%)

C. Impaired hepatic glycogenolysis (7%)

D. Increased release of cortisol (1%)
