This patient is suffering from acute adrenal insufficiency (adrenal crisis) due to suppression
of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by long-term glucocorticoid therapy.
Glucocorticoids suppress the synthesis and release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)
from the hypothalamus and also block its ACTH stimulatory effect on the anterior pituitary.
Long-term suppression leads to atrophy of hypothalamic CRH-releasing neurons, pituitary
corticotrophic cells, and the adrenal zona reticularis (androgen- producing inner zone) and
zona fasciculata (cortisol-producing middle zone).

Chronic glucocorticoid use is characterized by low CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels that
cannot rise in response to stressful situations (eg, infections, surgery) (Choice A). This lack
of a stress response can result in relative glucocorticoid deficiency even when the patient's
baseline glucocorticoid regimen is maintained. Because glucocorticoids help maintain normal
vascular tone (eg, by increasing norepinephrine, renin, and angiotensin vasoconstrictive
activity), glucocorticoid deficiency can precipitate hypotension/shock. In such cases, a
higher stress dose is needed to compensate for the increased physiologic demands and
prevent the development of adrenal crisis.

(Choice B) Increased levels of CRH and ACTH with decreased cortisol suggest primary
adrenal insufficiency, as may be seen in autoimmune adrenalitis or bilateral adrenal
