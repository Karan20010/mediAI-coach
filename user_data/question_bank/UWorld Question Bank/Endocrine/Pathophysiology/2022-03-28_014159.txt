prolactin suppress GnRH secretion from the Aypotieleamlic® leading to reduced secretion of LH
(and to a lesser extent FSH) and subsequent hypogonadism. Nonsecretory
("nonfunctioning") adenomas can also cause mild hyperprolactinemia due to pressure on the
stalk, but these tumors primarily cause mass-effect symptoms (eg, hypopituitarism, headache,
bitemporal hemianopsia) due to pressure on surrounding structures.

Estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women. Low estrogen levels lead to
increased production of inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor—
alpha), increasing expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand
(RANKL) and resulting in increased osteoclast activity. Loss of estrogen, whether from
menopause, ovulatory dysfunction, or surgical removal of the ovaries, increases the risk of
bone loss and osteoporosis.

(Choice A) Adenomas are associated with pituitary apoplexy (hemorrhage into the pituitary).
However, this occurs more commonly with large adenomas and is not typically associated with
strokes located in the cortex.

(Choice B) Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 is characterized by pituitary
adenomas, hyperparathyroidism, and endocrine tumors of the pancreas. Gastrin-secreting
pancreatic tumors are common and may lead to recurrent peptic ulcers (Zollinger-Ellison
