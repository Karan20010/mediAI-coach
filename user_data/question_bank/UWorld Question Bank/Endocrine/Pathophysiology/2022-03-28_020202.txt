hormone involved in milk production, result in galactorrhea (nonlactational milk production) and
infertility in premenopausal women. Excess prolactin suppresses GnRH secretion from the
hypothalamus, leading to reduced secretion of LH (and to a lesser extent FSH) and
subsequent hypogonadism, anovulation, and amenorrhea. The resultant estrogen deficiency
can manifest as vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flashes), vaginal dryness and atrophy, and
dyspareunia. Because estrogen maintains bone mass in premenopausal women, prolonged
