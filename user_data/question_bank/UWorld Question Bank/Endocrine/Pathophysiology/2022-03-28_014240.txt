This patient has symptoms of hypercortisolism, including weight gain, weakness, and easy
bruising. She also has increased 24-hour urine excretion of cortisol and an elevated serum
cortisol level that is not suppressed by low-dose dexamethasone, which confirm the diagnosis
of Cushing syndrome. In addition, her ACTH level is elevated (ACTH-dependent Cushing
syndrome), which is most commonly due to an ACTH-secreting corticotroph pituitary adenoma
(Cushing disease).

Initially, excess ACTH rapidly acts to increase adrenal blood flow and metabolic activity,
primarily within the zona fasciculata and reticularis. ACTH stimulates the transfer of
cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane by steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (the
rate limiting step in steroid production) and its conversion to pregnenolone by cholesterol side-
chain cleavage enzyme. Increased pregnenolone availability results in increased cortisol
synthesis within the zona fasciculata and increased androgen production within the zona
