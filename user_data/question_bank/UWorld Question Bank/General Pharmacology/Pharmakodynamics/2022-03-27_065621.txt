Older patients are at increased risk for adverse effects of medications due to decreased drug
clearance, cognitive and sensory deficits, multiple comorbidities, drug-drug interactions, and
poor drug compliance. Polypharmacy (ie, 25 prescription and/or over-the-counter
medications) is of particular concern in the elderly and can lead to a prescribing cascade, in

which additional drugs are given for adverse effects that are misinterpreted as a new medical
condition.

The Beers criteria were developed to identify drugs requiring caution in geriatric patients.
First-generation antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine) and other drugs with anticholinergic
activity can increase the risk of confusion, hallucinations, dizziness, dry mouth, and
constipation and should be avoided in this population. Other commonly used medications that
should be avoided in the elderly include benzodiazepines (and other sedating medications),
antipsychotics, many antiarrhythmics (eg, digoxin), and centrally acting skeletal muscle
relaxants.

(Choices A and E) Although hypotension due to excessive antihypertension medication use
could cause dizziness, this patient has normal blood pressure and heart rate, making this
much less likely as a cause of her dizziness. In addition, although centrally acting alpha
agonists (eg, clonidine) and alpha-1 blockers (eg, doxazosin) confer a high risk of orthostatic
