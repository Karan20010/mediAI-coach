(Choice D) Increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) within tumors
stimulates blood vessel growth, facilitating tumor expansion and increasing the potential for
metastasis. Anti-VEGF antibodies (eg, bevacizumab) bind VEGF and inhibit tumor-induced
angiogenesis. Although EGFR stimulation also plays a role in angiogenesis, in this case, the
anti-EFGR antibodies are used for targeting purposes and may not necessary inhibit the
EFGR receptor (antibodies can be stimulatory, inhibitory, or have no signaling effect depending
on the attachment site).

Educational objective:

Antibody-drug conjugates improve drug efficacy and minimize toxicity by allowing conventional
chemotherapeutic agents (eg, cisplatin) to selectively target and kill cancer cells while sparing
healthy cells (ie, targeted delivery).
