A novel antiretroviral medication, Drug X, is being developed for treating patients with HIV
infection. Initial studies show a high rate of treatment failure due to continued viral proliferation
in the brain. However, treatment success rates improve when Drug X is combined with an
adjuvant agent. Data comparing the two medication regimens is shown in the table below.
