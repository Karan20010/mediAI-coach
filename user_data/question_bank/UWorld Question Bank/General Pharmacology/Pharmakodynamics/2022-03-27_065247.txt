This patient is receiving chronic opioid therapy for nonspecific low back pain due to lumbar
osteoarthritis. He reports worsening pain despite an increased drug dose. No new structural
explanation for increased pain was revealed on medical evaluation (ie, unchanged spine
imaging and physical examination). Therefore, the loss of opioid analgesic efficacy is likely

due to drug tolerance: higher doses of drugs are required to achieve the same clinical effect.
A distinction is drawn between pharmacokinetic versus pharmacodynamic tolerance:

e Pharmacokinetic tolerance (ADME): The plasma level of the active drug is decreased due
to impaired Absorption (eg, short bowel syndrome), increased tissue Distribution (eg,
plasma protein binding, adiposity), increased Metabolism (eg, P450 cytochrome induction),
or increased Excretion.

eÂ¢ Pharmacodynamic tolerance: The plasma level of the active drug is unchanged (ie,
normal pharmacokinetics). However, the action of the drug on target cells is blunted (eg,
receptor downregulation, decreased intracellular signaling), reducing the overall
pharmacologic effect.

In both cases, tolerance can be innate or acquired. Innate tolerance refers to inborn
differences in genes coding for enzymes involved in drug metabolism (pharmacokinetic) or
