Antagonists are agents that bind to but do not activate receptors. Antagonists can be either
competitive or noncompetitive. Competitive antagonists bind to the exact same receptor
binding sites as endogenous or exogenous agonists, thereby preventing agonist binding and
activation of the receptor. Competitive antagonism can be reversible (ionic bond) or
irreversible (covalent bond). The effect of a reversible competitive antagonist can be
overcome by high concentrations of agonist, which cause displacement of the antagonist from
the receptors by mass action.

Noncompetitive antagonists, on the other hand, bind to receptors at a site other than the
primary agonist binding site, thereby causing a conformational (allosteric) change in the
receptor protein that modifies the agonist binding site and prevents agonist binding. By
binding to a different site than the agonist, noncompetitive antagonists are able to remain
bound to the receptor even when high concentrations of agonist are present because the
agonist is unable to displace noncompetitive antagonists from the receptor.

The question has asked how the curve for bethanechol (Curve A) would be affected by the

introduction of a reversible competitive antagonist. A reversible competitive antagonist is
expected to require higher doses of the full agonist (bethanechol) to be present to achieve the
