This patient has acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, which is likely an adverse
reaction to his nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Cyclooxygenase (COX)
catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins,
prostacyclin, and thromboxane. COX enzymes are involved in mediating inflammation but are
also required for housekeeping functions (eg, platelet aggregation, gastric mucosal
protection). COX enzymes are inhibited by NSAIDs such as naproxen. As a result, NSAIDs
can cause impairment of prostaglandin-dependent GI mucosal protection, leading to
mucosal erythema, erosions, and ulceration. Upper GI symptoms can occur within the first 24
hours of starting an NSAID, and changes to the mucosa can be seen within the first week.

Most adverse drug reactions are predictable due to the known pharmacologic properties of the
drug and usually occur after extended drug exposure. Unpredictable reactions are less
common and occur due to immune processes or other mechanisms. In this case, upper Gl
bleeding due to an NSAID is a well-known and predictable adverse event.

(Choice A) Exaggerated drug sensitivity refers to adverse reactions that occur due to known
pharmacologic actions of the drug but at a lower dose than expected (eg, due to altered
metabolism or increased end-organ susceptibility). Patients with deficiency of thiopurine
methyltransferase, an enzyme that metabolizes azathioprine, are more likely to experience
