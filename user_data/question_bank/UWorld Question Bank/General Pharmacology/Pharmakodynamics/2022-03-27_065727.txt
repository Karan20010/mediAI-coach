Sulfadiazine does not impair host DNA synthesis because dihydropteroate synthase is not
found in human cells. In contrast, pyrimethamine partially impairs host DNA synthesis
because dihydrofolate reductase generates THF in host cells. However, leucovorin (folinic
acid), a derivative of THF that does not require conversion by dihydrofolate reductase, is
usually administered with pyrimethamine to provide a bypass substrate for the generation of
host purine nucleic acids.

(Choice A) Patients are often treated with 2 different classes of antimicrobial medications to
broaden the coverage of potential pathogens. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine both block the
same metabolic pathway, so the combination is less useful for empiric antimicrobial therapy.
(Choice B) Gentamicin is often administered with an agent that targets the bacterial cell wall
(eg, ampicillin, vancomycin) to allow gentamicin to enter the intracellular space. Use of
sulfadiazine with pyrimethamine does not alter intracellular penetration.

(Choice C) Bacterial resistance can occur due to the production of an inactivating enzyme
(eg, beta-lactamase). Administration of an agent that inhibits the enzyme (eg, clavulanic acid)
can often restore the effect of the antibiotic (eg, amoxicillin).

(Choice D) Probenecid blocks the renal tubular excretion of most beta-lactam antibiotics,
