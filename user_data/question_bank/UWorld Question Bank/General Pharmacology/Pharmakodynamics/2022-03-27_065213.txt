and treatment with nonpharmacologic interventions and nonopioid analgesics have not
adequately controlled the pain. The patient began taking long-acting oxycodone 5 months ago
with good pain control. Over the past 2 months, he reports progressive worsening of the pain
despite a modest increase in dose. The patient also takes acetaminophen for breakthrough
pain and an osmotic laxative for constipation. Physical examination shows lower paraspinous
tenderness but no lower extremity neurologic deficits. Spine imaging shows no significant
changes from previous studies. Which of the following is the most likely reason for decreased
analgesic efficacy in this patient?

A. Innate tolerance due to genetic polymorphism of mu opioid receptors (3%)
YB. Pharmacodynamic tolerance due to decreased responsivity of the opioid receptor
system (81%)
C. Pharmacodynamic tolerance due to overexpression of delta and kappa opioid
receptors (11%)
D. Pharmacokinetic tolerance due to decreased rate of drug excretion (1%)

E. Pharmacokinetic tolerance due to drug partitioning to the adipose tissue
compartment (1%) Activate Windows
