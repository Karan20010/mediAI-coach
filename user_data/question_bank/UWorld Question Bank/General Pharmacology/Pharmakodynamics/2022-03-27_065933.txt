The study results show that the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) viral load level remains elevated
when subjects are treated with Drug X alone but becomes undetectable when Drug X is
combined with the adjuvant agent. Because average serum levels are relatively equal
between the 2 groups, it is likely that the adjuvant improves the efficacy of Drug X by
increasing its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Many drugs have a difficult time crossing the BBB due to the presence of specialized
endothelial cells with very tight intercellular junctions that form a physical barrier
separating the CNS from the circulation. In addition, multidrug transport proteins, particularly
p-glycoprotein, are highly expressed on the luminal membrane of brain capillary endothelial
cells. P-glycoprotein is an ATP-driven efflux pump that actively removes a wide range of
substrates from cells, including many commonly prescribed drugs (eg, antibiotics,
immunosuppressant agents, HIV protease inhibitors).

In HIV infection, poor penetration of antiretroviral medications allows the brain to act as an
anatomical sanctuary where viral replication can proceed unchecked, facilitating the
development of resistant strains. Methods of bypassing the BBB (eg, disruption of tight
junctions, p-glycoprotein inhibition) can improve drug delivery to the CNS. P-glycoprotein

transporters are also found on the apical surface of enterocytes and can limit drug
