(Choice A) Flushing and mydriasis are due to antagonism of the cholinergic receptor, not the

H1 receptor.

(Choice B) H2 receptors are found on parietal cells in the gastric mucosa. H2 antagonists
block gastric acid secretion by parietal cells.

(Choice D) Nicotinic cholinergic receptors are found in sympathetic and parasympathetic
ganglia and on skeletal muscle cells at the neuromuscular junction. Nicotinic receptor
antagonists (eg, rocuronium) are used to induce paralysis in preparation for surgery or
endotracheal intubation. Adverse effects include hemodynamic instability (eg, hypotension)
and respiratory insufficiency.

(Choice E) Alpha-1 adrenoreceptors are located on smooth muscle and neurons. Activation
of these receptors increases smooth muscle tone of the iris dilator (causing mydriasis) and
blood vessels (causing vasoconstriction); alpha-1 adrenergic agonists (eg, phenylephrine,
oxymetazoline) can be used in patients with allergic rhinitis because their vasoconstrictive
action reduces nasal congestion. However, vasoconstriction inhibits flushing.
