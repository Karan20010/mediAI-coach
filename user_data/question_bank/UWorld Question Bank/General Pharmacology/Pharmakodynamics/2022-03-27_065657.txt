This patient's new-onset hypertension and elevated levels of serum creatinine and
cyclosporine are suggestive of acute calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. Calcineurin
inhibitors such as cyclosporine cause dose-dependent renal vasoconstriction and tubular cell
damage, which can precipitate acute renal failure.

Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by the liver and gastrointestinal tract via the

cytochrome P450 system, specifically the CYP3A isoenzymes. Inhibition of intestinal P450
enzymes by the furocoumarins present in grapefruit juice can slow the breakdown of drugs
metabolized by this pathway, raising circulating levels of the affected drugs. Medications with
a narrow therapeutic index (eg, cyclosporine) have the highest risk of toxicity.

(Choice A) Changes in gastric pH do not significantly affect the oral bioavailability of
cyclosporine.

(Choice C) Transmembrane cyclosporine transport is not affected by grapefruit juice.
(Choice D) Pharmacodynamic potentiation is defined as a greater than additive effect that
occurs when 2 different drugs are administered simultaneously due to functional interactions

within the target tissues. Grapefruit juice increases the effect of cyclosporine by slowing its
metabolism, which is a pharmacokinetic mechanism.
