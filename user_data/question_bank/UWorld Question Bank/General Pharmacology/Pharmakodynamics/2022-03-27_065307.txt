concentration, leading to potential overdose rather than tolerance.

(Choice E) Adiposity (eg, increasing obesity) can contribute to pharmacokinetic tolerance by
raising the apparent volume of distribution, thereby lowering the plasma drug concentration.
However, equilibration between plasma and extravascular compartments is complete within 5
drug half-lives, occurring long before this patient's development of tolerance after 3 months.
Furthermore, adipose partitioning is primarily a concern for highly lipophilic drugs (eg, fentanyl,
not oxycodone).

Educational objective:

Chronic opioid therapy leads to the development of acquired pharmacodynamic tolerance via
downregulation and decreased responsiveness of opioid receptor systems.
