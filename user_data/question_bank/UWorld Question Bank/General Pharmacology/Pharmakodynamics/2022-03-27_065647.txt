nausea and anorexia. The patient underwent transplantation 6 months ago and had been
doing well until recently. On examination, his blood pressure is 160/96 mm Hg. There is no
tenderness at the site of the transplanted kidney. Serum creatinine is 3.4 mg/dL, and the
serum cyclosporine level is markedly increased. A month ago, he had normal blood pressure
and normal levels of cyclosporine and serum creatinine. Further questioning reveals that the

improve his overall health. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for
this patient's current condition?
