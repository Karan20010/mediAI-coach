A 31-year-old man comes to the office due to persistent nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. The
patient has a history of allergic rhinitis and recently moved across the country to start a new
job. His nasal symptoms worsened after the move, and he started using an over-the-counter
intranasal decongestant spray that initially provided prompt relief. However, after a few days,
he had to increase the frequency and number of sprays per nostril needed for adequate
symptom control. On examination, the nasal turbinates are swollen and pale with a clear nasal
discharge. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely responsible for this patient's

increased medication use?

© A. Accelerated drug metabolism

©) B. Decreased receptor affinity

©) C. Depletion of receptor-associated G proteins
