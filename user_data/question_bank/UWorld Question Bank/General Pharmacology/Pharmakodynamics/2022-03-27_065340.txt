Educational objective:

Certain lysosomal storage diseases, including Gaucher disease, can be treated with enzyme-
replacement therapy (eg, recombinant glucocerebrosidase). Because enzymes are large
proteins that cannot be orally absorbed, the replacement enzyme must be administered
intravenously. Entry into the cell occurs by endocytosis after the replacement enzyme binds to
mannose 6-phosphate receptors on the cell surface.
