Mechanisms of drug tolerance

Tolerance Mechanism Example
¢ ADME: | Absorption, ft ¢ Rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer)
Distribution, or accelerates metabolism of
Acquired ¢ Metabolism & Excretion (eg, warfarin

pharmacokinetic

enzyme induction)
| Plasma drug concentration
relative to naive state

Carbamazepine induces its
own metabolism after
repeated dosing

Acquired
pharmacodynamic

| Cellular response to drug (eg,

receptor downregulation)
Unchanged plasma drug
concentration relative to naive
state

Chronic opioid use: |
expression & responsivity of
u receptor system

Frequent albuterol rescue
inhaler:

{ expression of airway B2
receptors
