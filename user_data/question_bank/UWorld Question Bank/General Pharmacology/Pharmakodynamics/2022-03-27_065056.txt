This patient is likely taking a first-generation antihistamine (eg, diphenhydramine), which are
commonly used for treating environmental allergies and mast cell-related disorders. First-
generation antihistamines are nonspecific and act as antagonists to multiple receptors,
including the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. This leads to anticholinergic effects (eg,
fever, urinary retention, decreased sweating, altered mental status). In this patient, the
flushing is likely a compensatory response to dissipate excess body heat due to decreased

sweating, and the pupillary dilation is due to inhibition of the iris sphincter.

Although commonly described as H1 receptor antagonists, antihistamines are actually inverse
agonists that stabilize the receptor in the inactive state. H1 receptors are found in the vascular
endothelium and bronchial smooth muscle, where they mediate vascular permeability and
bronchoconstriction, as well as in the central nervous system where they are involved in
alertness. Antihistaminic effects relieve nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching.
First-generation antihistamines cross the blood-brain barrier and cause sedation. By contrast,
second-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine) are more specific to the histamine H1
receptor and have less permeability through the blood-brain barrier; they are generally less
effective than first-generation antihistamines but have significantly fewer side effects.

(Choice A) Flushing and mydriasis are due to antagonism of the cholinergic receptor, not the
