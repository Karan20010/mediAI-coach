Bioavailability refers to the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation

and is therefore available for eliciting the desired pharmacologic effect. A drug administered
by the intravenous (IV) route has 100% bioavailability by definition. For other modes of drug
administration (eg, oral [PO], intramuscular [IM], subcutaneous [SQ], transdermal [TD], rectal
[PR]), the bioavailability is usually less than 100%.

The bioavailability of a drug for a given route of administration can be determined by plotting
plasma drug concentrations over time for a given dose administered by both the IV route and
the other route being studied (eg, PO). The area under the curve (AUC) of each plot
represents the total systemic drug exposure for the given dose and route (Choice A).
Bioavailability can then be determined by comparing the AUCs of each curve. In this case, PO
bioavailability can be calculated by dividing the AUC of the PO curve by the AUC of the IV
curve.

In the case of PO administration, bioavailability depends upon the drug's ability to cross the
intestinal mucosa and can be influenced by gastric acidity and motility, the presence of food or
other drugs in the gut, and first-pass metabolism by the intestine and liver.

(Choice C) The maximal concentration at the peak of the PO curve (ie, peak plasma level) is
