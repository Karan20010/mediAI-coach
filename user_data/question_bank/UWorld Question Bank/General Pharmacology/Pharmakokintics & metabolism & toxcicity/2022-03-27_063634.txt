The half-life (t,,) is the time required for the plasma concentration of a drug with first-order
elimination kinetics to decrease by 50%. At time zero, 100% of the drug is present, and with
the passage of each subsequent half-life, half of the remaining drug is eliminated. After 5 half-

life intervals, a drug is almost completely eliminated from the body. A drug's half-life depends
on 2 pharmacokinetic properties:

¢ Clearance (CL) represents the volume of plasma completely cleared of a substance per
unit time (eg, mL/min). The CL rate is constant for most drugs and depends on the
particular metabolic conversion (eg, glucuronidation to inactive form) and/or elimination
pathways (eg, biliary or urinary excretion) used to remove the drug from the body.
Increased glucuronidation or glomerular filtration would increase plasma CL of the drug,
leading to decreased drug half-life (Choices A and B).

Volume of distribution (V.) refers to the extent to which a drug distributes in body tissue
compared to its plasma concentration. A drug's V, is determined by its intrinsic properties
(eg, lipid solubility, protein binding), as well as patient factors such as body weight and
composition (eg, increased fat vs lean mass). In general, a higher V, means that the drug

is increasingly bound to body tissues with a smaller proportion found in the plasma.

Because plasma concentrations are lower for any given dose, drugs with higher V, take
