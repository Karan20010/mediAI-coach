or mononitrate) is used to prevent recurrent anginal episodes in patients with chronic stable
it angina.

Sublingual nitroglycerin is absorbed rapidly from oral mucosa directly into the venous

6 circulation and has a rapid onset of action within 2-5 minutes. Long-acting isosorbide
= dinitrate is absorbed via the gastrointestinal tract and undergoes extensive first-pass
v metabolism in the liver prior to release in the systemic circulation. This leads to low
. bioavailability and the need for much higher doses of oral formulations as compared to
. * sublingual nitroglycerin.
oe (Choice A) Chronic nitrate therapy on a regular basis leads to nitrate tolerance, with

attenuation of blood pressure response and anti-anginal effects. Higher doses do not prevent
2s nitrate tolerance. On the contrary, use of sublingual nitroglycerin on an intermittent, as-needed
basis (nitrate-free intervals) prevents the development of nitrate tolerance.
