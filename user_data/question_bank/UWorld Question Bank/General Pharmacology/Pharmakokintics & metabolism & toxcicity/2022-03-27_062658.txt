Drug distribution is not uniform; the rate at which drugs are delivered to target tissues is
dependent on several factors, such as regional blood flow and drug characteristics. The
pharmacokinetic profile of highly lipophilic anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, can be predicted
using a multi-compartment model of distribution. Following administration of a single
intravenous bolus, drug levels are high in the central compartment (ie, plasma). However,
the drug is quickly distributed to the well-perfused peripheral compartment (eg, brain, liver,
kidneys, lungs) due to the increased lipophilicity of the tissues compared to the blood.

Over time, drug redistribution will occur through the central compartment into the poorly-
perfused peripheral compartment (eg, skeletal muscle, fat, bone), which has the highest
volume of distribution for lipophilic agents. Redistribution occurs rapidly with highly lipophilic
drugs and is responsible for the short duration of action seen with commonly used anesthetics
such as propofol.

(Choices A, B, C, and D) These organs have relatively high blood flow and are considered
part of the well-perfused peripheral compartment. They will rapidly take up drugs from the
central compartment and are visualized as the dashed line on the above graph.
