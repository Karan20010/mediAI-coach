The volume of distribution (V.) refers to a hypothetical volume of fluid into which the
administered amount of drug would need to be uniformly distributed to produce the observed
plasma concentration. The volume of distribution is determined by administering a given
amount of drug by the intravenous route and subsequently measuring the initial plasma
concentration of the drug. The formula is as follows:

V, (L) = amount of drug given (mg) / plasma concentration of drug (mg/L)

The average total body water is approximately 41 liters. Of that, the extracellular fluid volume
is about 14 L, or 1/3 of total body water. Within the extracellular fluid, the plasma volume is
about 3 L, and interstitial fluid makes up the rest. Initially, the drug enters the plasma
compartment by the IV route. If a drug has a large molecular weight, is bound extensively to
plasma proteins, or is highly charged (hydrophilic), then the drug generally remains in the
plasma compartment and the volume of distribution is usually low as in the case above (about
3-5 liters). If the drug has a small molecular weight but is hydrophilic, it can distribute into the
interstitial fluid compartment outside of the blood vessels as well as in the intravascular
compartment. In these cases the volume of distribution is limited to a total volume of about 14-
16 liters (plasma volume plus interstitial volume). If the drug has a small molecular weight and
is also uncharged (hydrophobic or lipophilic), then the drug can cross cell membranes and
