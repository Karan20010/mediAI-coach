Drugs are typically dosed to maintain plasma drug concentrations within a target range.
Although fixed drug dosing is convenient for providers and patients, dosing based on body
weight (eg, mg/kg) is often used to improve safety and efficacy, particularly for medications
with a narrow therapeutic window (eg, heparins, aminoglycosides, anesthetics).

Body weight affects both the rate of drug clearance and the volume of distribution. Drug
clearance rates correlate closely with lean body weight (ie, the weight of all nonadipose
tissues, including muscle, liver, kidneys). Likewise, the volume of distribution for most drugs
also gets larger as lean body mass increases. However, obesity causes a disproportional
increase in adipose mass, which can have a variable effect on the volume of distribution
depending on the solubility of the drug (eg, hydrophilic, hydrophobic).

Aminoglycosides are large, charged molecules that cannot cross cell membranes; their
volume of distribution is limited to the extracellular space, which increases only marginally in
obese individuals. As a result, dosing in obese patients is based on an adjusted body
weight that takes into account only a portion (~40%) of the excess adipose mass.

(Choice B) The route of elimination does not directly impact weight-based drug dosing, aside
from the fact that lipophilic drugs more often undergo hepatic elimination. Furthermore,
aminoglycosides are not metabolized by the liver; they are freely filtered by the glomerulus and
