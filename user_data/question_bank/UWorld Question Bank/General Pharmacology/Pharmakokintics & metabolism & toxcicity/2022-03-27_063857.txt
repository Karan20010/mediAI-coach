Educational objective:

Excessive acetaminophen use causes toxicity through its metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone
imine, which disrupts hepatocyte mitochondrial function and induces oxidative injury
throughout the liver. The resulting hepatocellular liver injury markedly elevates
aminotransferase, with levels sometimes exceeding 1,000 U/L.
