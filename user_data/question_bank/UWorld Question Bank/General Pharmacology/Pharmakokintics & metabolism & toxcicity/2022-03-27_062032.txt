Educational objective:

Serotonin syndrome is characterized by a triad of autonomic instability, altered mental status,
and neuromuscular irritability. It may develop when a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOl)
antidepressant or a non-antidepressant with MAOI activity (eg, linezolid) is combined with a
serotonergic medication such as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, serotonin-

norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic antidepressant.
