Educational objective:

The half-life (t,.) of a drug is the time required to lower its concentration by 50%. The volume
of distribution (V,) refers to how well the drug distributes into tissues compared to plasma; the
higher the V,, the greater the drug distribution into the tissues. The drug concentration (mg/L)

is equal to drug dose (mg) divided by V, (L).
