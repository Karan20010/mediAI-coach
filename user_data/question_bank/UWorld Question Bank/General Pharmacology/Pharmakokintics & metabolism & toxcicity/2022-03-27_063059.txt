amount of drug eliminated also increases until the amount administered equals the amount
eliminated. When a drug is administered at regular intervals, the time needed to reach the
steady state level depends only on the drug half-life (ie, it takes 5 half-lives to reach 97% of the
steady-state level); the exact size of each dose or interval between doses does not matter.

(Choices C, D, and E) Loading doses are larger than maintenance doses and can be used
during treatment initiation to shorten the time needed to reach target steady-state plasma
concentrations. They are most useful when an immediate therapeutic response is needed (eg,
life-saving antibiotics) or when using drugs with large volumes of distribution (eg,

amiodarone). Total body weight influences the volume of distribution and is often used when
calculating the loading dose. However, these parameters are not needed when calculating the
maintenance dose because the amount of drug lost per unit of time depends only on the
steady-state plasma concentration and drug clearance.

Educational objective:
Clearance (CL) determines the dose rate required to maintain a given steady-state plasma
concentration (C..):

Maintenance dose = C,; x CL x dosing interval
