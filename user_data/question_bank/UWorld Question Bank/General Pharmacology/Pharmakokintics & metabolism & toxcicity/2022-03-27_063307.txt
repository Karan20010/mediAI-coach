reach intracellular compartment. These drugs have the highest volume of distribution (41
liters). Drugs that are avidly bound in the tissues exhibit the highest volumes of distribution,
often much higher than the total body water volume, because these drugs accumulate readily
within cells thereby maintaining low plasma concentrations.

(Choice A) If the molecular weight of the drug is low, then the drug will tend to easily pass
through endothelial junctions into the interstitial fluid, making the volume of distribution at least
14 liters. The Vd may be higher if the drug is also hydrophobic.

(Choice B) Lipophilic drugs tend to readily cross cell membranes and distribute widely outside
the plasma and interstitial compartments. This tendency to collect within cells gives these
drugs a high volume of distribution.

(Choice C) A drug with a V, of 4.5 L, which is approximately the same as the plasma volume,
is likely to be highly bound to plasma proteins such as albumin. Binding to plasma proteins
tends to retain drug in the plasma compartment and prevent the diffusion of drug into the
extravascular compartments. If this drug were not bound to albumin, it would be more likely to
diffuse into the interstitium and a higher V, would be expected.

(Choice E) Bioavailability is a measure of absorption and is unrelated to the distribution of a
