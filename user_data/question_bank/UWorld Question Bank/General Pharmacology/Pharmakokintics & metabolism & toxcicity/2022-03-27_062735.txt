The above graph shows the plasma drug concentration-time curves of the 2 different oral
formulations. The one represented by the blue curve shows a reduced and delayed peak
level relative to the red curve, which is consistent with a sustained-release preparation.

The absorption speed of an orally administered drug depends on the rate at which it dissolves
in gastrointestinal fluids. Capsules and tablets can be designed with the active ingredient
embedded in an insoluble matrix or encapsulated with coatings that dissolve at different rates
to delay intestinal absorption. Slower drug absorption can have several advantages,
including:

e Reduced incidence of adverse effects due to dampening of peak levels

¢ Longer duration of therapeutic effect due to prolonged absorption of the drug

¢ Improved patient compliance due to less frequent administration

These benefits make sustained-release preparations particularly useful for drugs with short
half-lives (ie, allowing prolonged effect without need for multiple doses) or narrow therapeutic
windows (ie, maintaining effective drug levels while minimizing absorption peaks).

(Choice B) Enhanced CYP enzyme induction by the blue formulation would cause increased
drug metabolism over time as additional enzymes are synthesized, leading to decreased

serum drug levels.
