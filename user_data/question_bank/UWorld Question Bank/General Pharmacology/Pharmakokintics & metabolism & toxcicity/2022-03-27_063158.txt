In this example, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic is administered to adult and neonatal patients
using the same weight-based dosing regimen (eg, 5 mg/kg). However, plasma
concentrations of the drug are lower in neonates compared to the adults, resulting in
decreased effectiveness.

Neonates have substantial pharmacokinetic differences compared to adult patients that affect
drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. Changes in gastrointestinal parameters in
neonates (eg, decreased gastric pH, reduced intestinal motility) can have a variable effect on
the absorption of orally administered drugs. However, in this case, the drug is being
administered intravenously, so changes in absorption are unlikely to be the cause of the
plasma concentration discrepancy.

Neonates also have an increased proportion of total body water with a lower content of body
fat compared to adults. This difference in body composition results in water-soluble drugs
(eg, aminoglycosides, vancomycin) having a larger than expected volume of distribution
relative to body mass, leading to lower plasma concentrations when the drug is
administered at the same weight-based dosage as given to adult patients. Furthermore,
neonates have an immature blood-brain barrier that increases the permeability of many
substances into the CNS compartment, which (in addition to increasing the distribution
