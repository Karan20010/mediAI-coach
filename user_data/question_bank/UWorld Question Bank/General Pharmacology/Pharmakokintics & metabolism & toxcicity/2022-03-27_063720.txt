Educational objective:
Half-life (t,.) is a measure of how quickly a drug with first-order kinetics is eliminated from the

body. A drug is almost completely eliminated after 5 half-life intervals. The half-life can be
calculated from the drug's volume of distribution (V.) and clearance rate (CL) using the
following equation:

tie = (0.7 x V.)/ CL.
