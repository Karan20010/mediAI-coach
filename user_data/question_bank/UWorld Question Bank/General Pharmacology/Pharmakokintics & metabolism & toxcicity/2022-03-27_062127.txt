(Choices A and C) Both diazepam and haloperidol can be used for sedation or cases of
severe agitation. Haloperidol is an antipsychotic that blocks dopamine receptors in the CNS,
and diazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that positively modulates GABA-A activity.
Neither medication reverses the peripheral anticholinergic manifestations (eg, mydriasis,
tachycardia).

Educational objective:

Physostigmine is a cholinesterase inhibitor with a tertiary ammonium structure that can reverse
both the central and peripheral nervous system symptoms of anticholinergic toxicity.
Neostigmine, edrophonium, and pyridostigmine have a quaternary ammonium structure that
limits central nervous system penetration.
