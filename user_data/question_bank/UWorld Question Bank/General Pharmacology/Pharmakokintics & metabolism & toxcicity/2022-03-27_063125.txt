(Choice B) Decreased activity of hepatic N-acetyltransferase results in a diminished ability to
metabolize drugs such as isoniazid and sulfonamides, leading to an increased likelihood of
toxicity.

(Choice C) Thiopurine methyltransferase is responsible for the metabolism of thiopurine
compounds such as the immunosuppressive drug 6-mercaptopurine. Enzyme deficiency
leads to increased drug toxicity.

(Choice D) P-glycoprotein is a cell membrane protein that drives efflux of a number of
substances out of the cell. Overexpression of p-glycoprotein in tumor cells has been identified
as a cause of multidrug resistance.

Educational objective:

Cytochrome P450 enzymes found in the liver are responsible for the majority of drug
metabolism. Polymorphisms occurring in the genes coding for these enzymes result in various
phenotypes that differ in their rates of metabolism; individual differences in phenotype alter
treatment efficacy and drug toxicity.
