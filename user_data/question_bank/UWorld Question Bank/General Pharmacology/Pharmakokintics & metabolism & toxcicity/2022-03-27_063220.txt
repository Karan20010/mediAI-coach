A clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel therapy to treat
refractory Crohn disease. The medication is a monoclonal antibody against the a487 integrin,
which inhibits migration of T-lymphocytes into the intestinal parenchyma and produces a gut-
selective anti-inflammatory effect. Patients who have active, moderate to severe Crohn
disease and have failed conventional therapy are enrolled in the study. Many of these patients

have renal or hepatic dysfunction, and some take other medications that affect cytochrome
P450 enzymes. Which of the following is the most appropriate dose adjustment in this patient

population to decrease drug toxicity?

(©) A. Higher dose in patients taking cytochrome P450 inducers
(©) B. Lower dose in patients with decreased glomerular filtration
©) C. Lower dose in patients with hepatocellular dysfunction

©) D. Lower dose in patients with renal tubular dysfunction

() E. No dose adjustment necessary
