¢ Volume of distribution (V.) refers to the extent to which a drug distributes in body tissue
compared to its plasma concentration. A drug's V, is determined by its intrinsic properties
(eg, lipid solubility, protein binding), as well as patient factors such as body weight and
composition (eg, increased fat vs lean mass). In general, a higher V, means that the drug
is increasingly bound to body tissues with a smaller proportion found in the plasma.
Because plasma concentrations are lower for any given dose, drugs with higher V, take

longer to eliminate from the body and therefore have a longer half-life.
The half-life of a drug can be calculated using these parameters, as follows:
ti. = (0.7 * V.) / CL

In this case, the increased drug half-life seen in certain patients is likely due to increased total
body weight, resulting in a higher volume of distribution.

(Choices C and D) Oral bioavailability can vary between individuals due to intrinsic
differences (eg, age, sex, disease), diet, and medications (eg, proton pump inhibitors).
Although increased oral bioavailability can raise peak serum drug levels, drug half-life would
not be affected because the amount of drug eliminated per unit time increases as the drug's
plasma concentration increases (true of drugs exhibiting first-order kinetics, which account for ctivate V
