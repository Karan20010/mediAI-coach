(Choice B) Clinically significant resistance to tetracyclines is uncommon in acne and unlikely
to occur abruptly. In addition, besides antimicrobial effects, tetracyclines have anti-
inflammatory effects in acne that would likely provide residual benefit.

(Choice D) Tetracyclines such as doxycycline and tigecycline are eliminated by hepatic
excretion. Neither iron nor oral contraceptives would increase drug elimination.

(Choice E) Estrogens increase the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin, which can
affect plasma levels of certain steroid hormones and related agents (eg, danazol,
levonorgestrel). Tetracyclines are not significantly affected.

Educational objective:

Tetracyclines interact with polyvalent cations (eg, iron, calcium, aluminum, magnesium) to form
nonabsorbable chelate complexes in the gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to significantly
decreased drug absorption and therapeutic effect. Fluoroquinolones and thyroxine are also
susceptible to chelation.
