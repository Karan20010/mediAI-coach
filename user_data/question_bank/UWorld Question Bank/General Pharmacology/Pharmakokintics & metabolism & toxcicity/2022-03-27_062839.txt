Methotrexate (MTX) is a folic acid analog that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), the

enzyme that converts dietary folic acid to tetrahydrofolate (THF), through direct competition.

THF is a single-carbon group donor in the synthesis of purines and thymidylic acid (which

contributes to pyrimidine formation). MTX functions as a chemotherapeutic agent through

inhibition of DNA synthesis and as an anti-psoriasis agent through immunomodulatory

effects on activated T cells. However, MTX causes death of all rapidly dividing cells,

particularly those of the gastrointestinal tract (Gl) mucosa (explaining this patient's

aphthous ulcers) and bone marrow (explaining this patient's pancytopenia).

Folinic acid (leucovorin) can reverse MTX toxicity if given early. It serves as a reduced form
of folic acid thought not to require DHFR to be converted to THF and is therefore unaffected
by MTX. Leucovorin is administered following high-dose MTX as part of a chemotherapeutic
plan in which it serves to rescue bone marrow, and GI and other mucosal cells from MTX
toxicity. In addition, when used in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin
potentiates the cytotoxic action of 5-FU (by binding thymidylate synthetase) and is frequently
included in colorectal cancer chemotherapy regimens.

(Choice A) Allopurinol and its metabolite, oxipurinol, are predominantly noncompetitive
inhibitors of xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol is used in the treatment of gout and for prevention of
