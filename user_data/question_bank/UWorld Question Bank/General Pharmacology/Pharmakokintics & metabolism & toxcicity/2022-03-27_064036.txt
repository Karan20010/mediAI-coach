Question Id: 1713
Bioavailability is the fraction of an administered ana that reaches the systemic circulation

unchanged. Oral bioavailability is dependent on the intrinsic absorptive properties of the drug
as well as any first-pass metabolism that the drug undergoes by enzymes present in the
intestine and liver. A drug that exhibits high first-pass metabolism is broken down extensively
and will have a low concentration in the systemic circulation (low bioavailability). To efficiently
use drugs with high first-pass metabolism, other routes of administration are typically
employed (eg, intravenous, sublingual, rectal) to bypass the portal circulation.

Rectal drug administration (suppository) allows for partial bypass of first-pass metabolism.
Venous drainage of the anorectum above the dentate line is to the portal venous system via
the superior rectal veins (drain to inferior mesenteric vein). However, the region below the
dentate line drains into the systemic circulation via the middle and inferior rectal veins (drain to
internal iliac and internal pudendal veins, respectively). This proportion of venous blood that
enters the systemic circulation directly from the rectal region increases the bioavailability
of drugs that are otherwise extensively metabolized by the liver following oral administration.

(Choice B) Blood flow to different regions of the intestine is directly related to the metabolic
activity of the associated mucosa. Greater blood flow rates facilitate absorption and
bioavailability of many drugs through the establishment of a favorable concentration gradient.
