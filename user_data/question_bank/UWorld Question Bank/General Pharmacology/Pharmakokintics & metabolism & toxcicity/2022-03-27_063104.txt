number of patients with hormone receptor-positive, early-stage breast cancer who received
adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen were evaluated. Various clinical, demographic, and drug
concentration data were analyzed. A comparison of patients who had disease recurrence with
those who remained cancer free showed that some of the relapsed patients had lower serum
concentrations of endoxifen and 4-hydroxytamoxifen, the active metabolites of tamoxifen.
Which of the following is the most likely cause of the drug's ineffectiveness in this subset of
patients?

© A. Activating mutation affecting a downstream signal transducer
©) B. Decreased hepatic N-acetyltransferase activity
