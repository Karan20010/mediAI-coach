Most drugs are administered in the form of repetitive, intermittent doses designed to achieve a
steady-state plasma concentration within a targeted therapeutic range. The amount of each
dose is calculated so that the administered dose is just enough to replace the amount of drug
eliminated by the body since the last dose. This replacement dose (maintenance dose)
depends on both of the following:

¢ Steady-state plasma concentration (C.,)
¢ Drug clearance (CL), or volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time (eg, mL/min)

Multiplying these two parameters gives the elimination rate, or the amount of drug eliminated
from the body per unit of time:

Elimination rate = C.; x CL

The maintenance dose can then be calculated for the appropriate dosing interval (eg, 12 hr) by
multiplying the elimination rate (C;; x CL) by the time between doses:

Maintenance dose = C,, x CL x dosing interval

(Choice B) When a drug is administered more quickly than it can be eliminated from the body,
it accumulates until a steady-state level is reached; as plasma concentration increases, the AGiVEKE Winelons
