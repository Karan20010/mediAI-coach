Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are a group of heme-containing proteins that are
responsible for the majority of drug metabolism, which occurs predominately in the liver.
Various CYP subtypes exist, with CYP3A, CYP2D, and CYP2C as the most active subtypes
involved in drug metabolism. These enzymes generally function to deactivate drugs and
facilitate excretion from the body by improving water solubility. However, they also metabolize
certain compounds to their active forms.

Polymorphisms may occur in the genes coding for these enzymes, altering their expression
or activity. Three important phenotypes exist: poor, intermediate, and rapid metabolizer.
Identifying these variations on an individual basis provides a framework for optimizing therapy,
predicting treatment efficacy, and minimizing toxicity.

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator used in the treatment of estrogen
receptor-positive breast cancer, is a prodrug metabolized by CYP2D to its active metabolite,
endoxifen. Patients with genetic polymorphisms resulting in poor CYP2D activity are exposed
to decreased levels of the active metabolite and have a higher risk of disease relapse.

(Choice A) Activation of downstream signal transducer proteins, such as KRAS, leads to
activation of transcription factors that promote cell growth. Mutations in the KRAS gene are
associated with the development of colorectal and lung cancers.
