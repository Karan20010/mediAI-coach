Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are used to treat a growing variety of malignant (eg,
leukemia/lymphoma, melanoma) and autoimmune diseases (eg, Crohn disease, rheumatoid
arthritis). The therapeutic effect of mAbs is achieved by binding to their target antigen in the
plasma or on the cell surface and blocking deleterious receptor interactions or triggering a
cytotoxic immune response against abnormal cells.
Because of their large molecular size, mAbs cannot be administered orally and must be given
via intravenous or subcutaneous/intramuscular routes. Unlike most other drugs, mAbs are not
eliminated by hepatic or renal clearance, but are instead removed from the body in 2
primary ways:
¢ Target-mediated drug clearance: mAbs directed against cell surface antigens undergo
internalization (receptor-mediated endocytosis) upon binding to their targets, removing
them from the circulation

¢ Nonspecific clearance: Immunoglobulins are constitutively taken up by reticuloendothelial
macrophages (via binding to Fc receptors) and vascular endothelial cells (via pinocytosis)

Once internalized, immunoglobulins are catabolized into amino acids within lysosomes.

(Choices A and C) Many drugs undergo modifications by the cytochrome P450 system and
