Serotonin syndrome is characterized by a triad of autonomic instability (eg, hyperthermia,
hypertension, tachycardia), altered mental status (eg, agitation, confusion), and
neuromuscular hyperactivity (eg, tremor, hyperreflexia, myoclonus), as well as
gastrointestinal symptoms and diaphoresis. It is due to an increased serotonergic effect in the
central nervous system (eg, increased 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor stimulation).

Serotonin syndrome rarely occurs with a single serotonergic drug used at therapeutic doses.
More commonly, it is due to the combined effects of several serotonergic medications,
overdose, and/or a drug-drug interaction. Serotonin effect is increased when a monoamine
oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) is combined with a serotonergic antidepressant (selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI], serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or tricyclic
antidepressant).

Linezolid is used to treat infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, particularly vancomycin-
resistant enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid has MAOI
activity and therefore can precipitate serotonin syndrome with concomitant use of an SSRI
(eg, paroxetine) or with other serotonergic medications.

(Choices A, B, D, and E) Clindamycin, doxycycline, penicillin, and vancomycin do not have

MAOI effects. They do not cause serotonin syndrome when combined with a serotonergic
