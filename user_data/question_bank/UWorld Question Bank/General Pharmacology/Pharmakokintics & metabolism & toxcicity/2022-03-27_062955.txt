acetylators of isoniazid also metabolize (acetylate) dapsone, hydralazine, and procainamide
slowly, causing accumulation of these drugs as well. Slow acetylators of these drugs are at
increased risk of toxic effects, while fast acetylators may require much higher therapeutic
doses to achieve a therapeutic effect.

(Choice A) Methylation is an important drug biotransformation method to consider when
prescribing drugs such as azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine, drugs used in the treatment of
some inflammatory disorders of the bowel and skin.

(Choice B) Glucuronidation is a biotransformation pathway utilized for the metabolism of
numerous drugs as well as endogenous substances such as bilirubin. No bimodality has been
described with this pathway, but conditions such as Gilbert syndrome involve dysfunction of
the glucuronyl transferase system that can lead to toxic accumulation of some drugs.

(Choice C) Hydrolysis occurs with enzymes such as esterases and amidases. Isoniazid is not
metabolized by this pathway, and hydrolysis does not exhibit polymorphic metabolism.

(Choice E) Amine oxidation is usually undertaken by monoamine oxidases or by cytochrome
oxidative deamination. Neither process metabolizes isoniazid nor exhibits bimodality.
