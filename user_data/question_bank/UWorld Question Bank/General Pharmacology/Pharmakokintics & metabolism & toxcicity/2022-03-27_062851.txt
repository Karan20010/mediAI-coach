Educational objective:

Folinic acid (leucovorin) can reverse the toxicity of methotrexate in non-cancerous cells in the
gastrointestinal mucosa and bone marrow if administered at the appropriate time. Leucovorin
serves as a reduced form of folic acid that does not require the action of dihydrofolate

reductase.
