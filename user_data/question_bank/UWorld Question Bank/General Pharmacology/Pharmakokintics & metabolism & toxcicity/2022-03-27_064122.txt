Researchers are developing a new glycopeptide antibiotic similar to vancomycin.
Susceptibility testing reveals that the new drug is bactericidal against gram-positive organisms
at serum concentrations above 15 g/mL. Two different dosage regimens are developed to
achieve a target serum trough concentration of 15-20 g/mL: one administered as 1 gram
every 6 hours and the other as 2 grams every 12 hours. The two regimens are tested in
healthy volunteers during an early-phase clinical trial, and the following pharmacokinetic
profiles are obtained.
