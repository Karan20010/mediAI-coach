aminoglycosides are not metabolized by the liver; they are freely filtered by the glomerulus and
excreted unchanged in the urine.

(Choice C) The vast majority of drugs, including aminoglycosides, undergo first- (not zero-)
order metabolism. In addition, body weight adjustments with regard to medication dosing are
usually made according to the way a drug distributes within the body's tissues.

(Choice D) Acidic drugs with a high degree of plasma protein binding (eg, warfarin) are
retained in the intravascular space and have a limited volume of distribution that is less
affected by body weight. In contrast, aminoglycosides have minimal plasma protein binding
and can distribute extensively into the interstitial compartment.

(Choice E) Lipophilic drugs partition extensively into adipose tissues; their volume of
distribution is better correlated with total body weight than with lean or adjusted body weight.
Highly lipophilic drugs (eg, phenytoin) are tightly sequestered within adipose tissue and often
require an initial loading dose to saturate fat stores and achieve adequate serum levels.

Educational objective:
Many drugs are dosed based on total body weight to improve safety and efficacy. In obese
individuals, use of lean body weight or an adjusted body weight may be necessary when

dosing hydrophilic drugs (eq. aminoglycosides) that do not distribute into adipose tissue.
