The drug under investigation is glucuronated by the liver into water-soluble byproducts that
can then be excreted by the kidney. The graph above shows how the rate of drug
glucuronidation changes with increasing drug doses. At lower doses, the quantity of drug-
glucuronide formed is directly proportional to the dose administered (ie, as more of the drug is
administered, more drug-glucuronide is produced). Because a fixed proportion of drug is
converted to the metabolite, this early portion of the graph represents first-order kinetics.

As the active sites on glucuronosyltransferase become saturated, the drug-glucuronide rate
does not continue to rise with increasing doses of the substrate drug. At this point (2 on the
graph), the kinetics change from first- to zero-order kinetics and the graph levels out to a
zero slope. With zero-order kinetics, a constant amount of drug is metabolized and
eliminated per unit of time regardless of its concentration or dose.

Zero- and first-order kinetics can also be represented graphically by showing the decrease in
drug concentration over time after a single dose. Zero-order metabolism is indicated by a

straight line with negative slope (fixed amount eliminated per unit of time), whereas first-order
kinetics manifest as an exponential decay curve (fixed proportion eliminated per unit of time).

(Choice A) After point 3, the curve remains flat, indicating that a constant amount of drug is
metabolized per unit of time regardless of the dose. As higher doses are administered, the
