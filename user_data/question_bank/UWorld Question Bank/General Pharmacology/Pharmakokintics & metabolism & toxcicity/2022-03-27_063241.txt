macrophages (via binding to Fc receptors) and vascular endothelial cells (via pinocytosis)
Once internalized, immunoglobulins are catabolized into amino acids within lysosomes.

(Choices A and C) Many drugs undergo modifications by the cytochrome P450 system and
subsequent conjugation reactions within hepatocytes that help facilitate excretion of the drug
into the urine or bile. In contrast, immunoglobulins are not metabolized by these systems, but

rather broken down by proteolytic enzymes.

(Choices B and D) Immunoglobulins are too large to undergo substantial filtration at the
glomerular basement membrane and are not secreted by the renal tubules. Therefore, renal
dysfunction does not significantly affect monoclonal antibody clearance.

Educational objective:

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are not eliminated by hepatic or renal clearance. Therefore, no
dose adjustment is necessary with impaired hepatic/renal function or use of cytochrome P450
inducers or inhibitors.
