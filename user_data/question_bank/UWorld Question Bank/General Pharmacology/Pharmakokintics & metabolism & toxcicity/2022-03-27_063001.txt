Educational Objective:

Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation. The speed with which a patient is able to acetylate
drugs depends on whether they are genetically "fast" or "slow" acetylators. The presence of
fast and slow acetylators within the same population results in a bimodal distribution of the
speed of isoniazid metabolism. Slow acetylators are at increased risk of adverse side effects.
