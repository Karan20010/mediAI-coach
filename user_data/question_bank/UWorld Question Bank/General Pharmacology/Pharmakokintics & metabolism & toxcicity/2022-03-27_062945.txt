The rate and extent of drug metabolism normally varies from person to person. These slight
interpersonal variations in the ability to metabolize drugs are typically reflected graphically by a
unimodal distribution, usually in the shape of a bell curve, when plasma levels of drug are
measured at a fixed time following a fixed dose of drug. This is the method that was used to
generate the graph given in the question stem. With most drugs, the majority of people fall
within one standard deviation and 95% of people fall within two standard deviations of the
population mean of plasma concentration. A single peak in this type of graph indicates that the
population being tested possesses a similar genetic drug metabolizing capacity.

A bimodal (discontinuous, polymorphic) curve, as shown in the question stem, results from the
presence of two apparently distinct groups within the study population and suggests a
pharmacogenetic polymorphism in drug metabolizing capacity. In other words, the two peaks
indicate two sets of responders to the drug within the population: one that rapidly converts the
drug into its metabolite (considered normals) and another that converts the drug slowly,
leading to accumulation of the original drug in the plasma.

Isoniazid is metabolized by acetylation to N-acetyl-isoniazid in the hepatic microsomal system

by the enzyme N-acetyl transferase and is subsequently excreted in the urine. The first and
second peaks in the above graph represent fast and slow acetylators, respectively. Slow
