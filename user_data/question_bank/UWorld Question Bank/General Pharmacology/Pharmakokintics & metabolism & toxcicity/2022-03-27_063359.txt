Statins (eg, atorvastatin) are the first-line therapy for most patients with hypercholesterolemia

and are useful in primary and secondary prevention of acute coronary events. Statins inhibit
HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme responsible for the rate-limiting step in synthesis of
cholesterol. Statins lower total cholesterol, LDL, and triglyceride levels.

The primary side effects of statins include myopathy and hepatitis. Statin-associated
myopathy is usually characterized by mild muscular pain and resolves with discontinuation of
the medication. However, some patients will develop severe myopathy with striking elevations
in creatine kinase levels and occasional rhabdomyolysis. The risk of severe myopathy is
increased when statins are given concurrently with fibrates (particularly gemfibrozil), which
impair the hepatic clearance of statins and lead to excessive blood levels. An increased risk of
statin myopathy is also likely with concurrent use of niacin or ezetimibe, but to a lesser extent
(Choice B).

(Choice A) Concurrent use of bile acid sequestrants (eg, cholestyramine) with statins does
not increase the risk of myopathy. However, bile acid sequestrants can reduce the
gastrointestinal absorption of statins.

(Choice D) Fibrates can increase drug levels of ezetimibe but this does not have a significant
impact on its side effects, which are generally mild and not dose-related. Ezetimibe does not
