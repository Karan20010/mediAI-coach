It is important to understand the difference between the median, mean, and mode, which are 3
measures of central tendency. The median of an ordered dataset is the number that
separates the right half of the data from the left half. The dataset MUST be ordered before the
median is determined. If the number of observations in the dataset is even, finding the median
requires adding the middle 2 values together and dividing that sum by 2.

The ordered dataset in this case is {75, 75, 80, 90, 110, 110}. There are 6 observations, which
is an even number of observations. The median value splits the dataset in half; it lies between
80 and 90 (3 values on the left and 3 values on the right). The median is (80 + 90) /2=85
mm Hg.

Now, assume one of the values is missing and the ordered dataset includes the following 5
observations (odd number of observations): {75, 80, 90, 110, 110}. In this case, the median
value would be 90 mm Hg, which splits the dataset in half (2 values on the left and 2 values on
the right).

(Choices A and D) The values 80 and 100 mm Hg are not measures of the center of the
dataset.

(Choice C) To find the mean of a dataset, add all of the observations and divide that sum by
