A normal distribution refers to a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution pattern with a fixed
proportion of observations lying within a certain distance of the mean. This distance is called
the standard deviation (SD) and is a measure of the degree of dispersion from the mean.
When the SD is small, the observations tend to have minimal variation and are tightly clustered
around the mean. In contrast, a large SD implies that the observations are spread over a large
range. According to the properties of normal distribution, 68% of all observations lie within 1
SD of the mean, with half of those above and half of those below the mean. The remaining
32% of observations lie outside 1 SD from the mean, with half of those remaining observations
above and the other half below 1 SD from the mean. In addition, 95% of all observations lie
within 2 SDs of the mean, and 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SDs from the mean. This
is commonly known as the "68-95-99.7 rule."

Based on the above example:

¢ 68% of observations lie within 1 SD: 220 mg/dL + 10 mg/dL = 210-230 mg/dL
¢ 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs: 220 mg/dL + 20 mg/dL = 200-240 mg/dL
¢ 99.7% of observations lie within 3 SDs: 220 mg/dL + 30 mg/dL = 190-250 mg/dL

Because the cutoff point of >240 mg/dL is 2 SDs from the mean, it follows that 2.5% of the

observations must lie below 200 mg/dL and 2.5% above 240 mg/dL. Therefore, of 400
