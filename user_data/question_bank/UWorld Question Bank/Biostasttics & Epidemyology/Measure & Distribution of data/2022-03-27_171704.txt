Relative risk reduction (RRR) measures how much a given treatment reduces the risk of
an unfavorable outcome relative to the control group. RRR may be defined as the difference
in risk of the unfavorable outcome in the treatment group (eg, new drug) compared to the
control group (eg, placebo):

In this example, RiSKcono (ie, risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the placebo group) is 9/75 =
0.12, and RiSKzesinen (ie, risk Of Severe cutaneous reactions in the new drug group) is 6/75 =
0.08. Therefore, RRR for severe cutaneous reactions among patients in the new drug group
is:

RRR = (0.12 - 0.08) / 0.12 = 0.33
Alternately, RRR may be calculated using relative risk (RR). When using RR, the formula for
RRR is:

RRR=1-RR

For this example, RR is the ratio of the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the new drug
group to the risk of severe cutaneous reactions in the placebo group, calculated as follows:
