This bar graph illustrates the frequency of urinary tract infection (UTI) episodes in the sample.
According to the figure, 50 children had 0 UTIs, 30 children had 1 UTI, 10 had 2 UTIs, and 10
had 3 UTIs.

In general, the average (or mean) of a dataset is the sum of the values divided by the total
number of values. In this example, the average number of UTI episodes per child is the sum
(ie, total number) of UTIs divided by the total sample size (ie, total number of children). The
total sample size is: 50 + 30 + 10 + 10 = 100 children. The total number of UTIs is: (0 x 50) +
(1 x 30) + (2 x 10) + (3 x 10) =0 + 30 + 20 + 30 = 80 UTIs. The average is obtained by
dividing the total number of UTIs (80) by the total sample size (100). Therefore, the average
number of UTI episodes per year = 80/100 = 0.8 UTIs for a child in this sample.

In conclusion, children age 2-5 years in this clinic experienced between 0 and 1 UTI over 1
year on average.

Educational objective:
The average (or mean) of a dataset of values is the sum of the values divided by the total
number of values.
