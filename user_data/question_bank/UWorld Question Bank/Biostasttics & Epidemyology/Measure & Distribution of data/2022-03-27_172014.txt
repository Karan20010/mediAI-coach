This case describes a cohort study in which participants are initially selected based on their
exposure status to a risk modifier: exposed (eg, vaccinated) or nonexposed (eg, not
vaccinated). Once participants are categorized based on exposure status, the occurrence (ie,
incidence) of the outcome/disease of interest (ie, traveler's diarrhea [TD]) within a specific
period is determined in each group. The risk of disease is finally compared between exposed
and nonexposed groups to estimate the association between exposure to a risk modifier and
disease occurrence. Acommon measure of association in cohort studies is the relative risk
(RR). The RR is calculated as follows:

RR = (risk of disease in exposed) / (risk of disease in nonexposed)

The exposed group could also have been defined as the unvaccinated group and the
nonexposed group as the vaccinated group; in this case, the RR would be inversed
(interpretation of RR depends on what is chosen to represent the exposure).

(Choices A and D) Incidence (ie, new occurrences of a disease in a population over a period)
and prevalence (ie, existing cases of a disease in a population at a point in time) are measures
of disease burden. They do not directly convey information regarding the relationship between
exposure and disease.
