patients included in the analysis, 10 patients (ie, 2.5%) would have a cholesterol level >240

mg/dL.
(Choice A) No more than 1-2 patients (0.25%-0.5% of the study population) would be
expected to have cholesterol levels that lie 3 SDs above or below the mean (ie, <190 mg/dL or

>250 mg/dL).
(Choice C) 20 patients (5% of the study population) would be expected to have cholesterol

levels that lie outside 2 SDs from the mean. Only half of these observations would lie above 2
SDs (ie, >240 mg/dL) from the mean.

(Choice D) 64 patients (16% of the study population) would be expected to have cholesterol
levels that lie 1 SD above the mean (ie, >230 mg/dL).

(Choice E) 128 patients (32% of the study population) would be expected to have cholesterol
levels that lie 1 SD above or below the mean (ie, >230 mg/dL or <210 mg/dL).

Educational objective:

In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution: 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation from
the mean; 95% of all values are within 2 standard deviations from the mean; 99.7% of all
values are within 3 standard deviations from the mean.
