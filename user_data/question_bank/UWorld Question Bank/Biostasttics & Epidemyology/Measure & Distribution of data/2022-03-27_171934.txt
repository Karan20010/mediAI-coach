above the mean or 1 SD below the mean. In men age 35-44:
¢ 34% have SBP 100-120 mm Hg, 34% have SBP 120-140 mm Hg, and, 68% have SBP
100-140 mm Hg.
¢ Half (50%) have SBP above the mean (ie, >120 mm Hg) and half have SBP below the
mean (<120 mm Hg).

Toa

¢ Given that 84% = 50% + 34%, this could represent the sum of those with SBP 100-120
mm Hg (34%) and those with SBP >120 mm Hg (50%): in other words, those with SBP
>100 mm Hg.

(Choice F) Based on the 68-95-99.7% rule, 95% of observations lie within 2 SDs (eg, 2 x 20
= 40 mm Hg) of the mean (eg, 120 mm Hg) (ie, SBP between 80 mm Hg [= 120 — 40] and 160
mm Hg [= 120 + 40)).

Educational objective:

In a normal (bell-shaped) distribution, 68% of all values are within 1 standard deviation (SD) of
the mean; 95% are within 2 SD of the mean; and 99.7% are within 3 SD of the mean.
