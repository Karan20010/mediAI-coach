Previous studies had identified 30 loci that accounted for <35% of disease heritability for RA.
Which of the following statements is correct regarding this study?
A. Combining the results of the European and Portuguese studies into a meta-analysis
decreases the power (5%)
B. Logistic regression is used because there is a stepwise increase in the strength of
association from Locus 1 to Locus 3 (26%)
C. The association between Locus 1 and RA in the meta-analysis is not statistically
significant because the odds ratio is <1 (19%)
YD. The threshold used for the p-value in the meta-analysis is 5 x 10-: because of the
large number of loci studied (38%)
E. With this meta-analysis, the 33 identified loci account for most disease heritability in
RA (10%)
