A physician is conducting a double-blind randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of a
new cream in reducing the risk of relapse in chronic recurrent atopic dermatitis. A total of 30
patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who were experiencing a flare are randomly
divided into 2 groups: 15 patients will receive the new cream, and 15 patients will receive
emollient alone. The rate of relapse after 2 weeks of treatment is 25% in the group who

received the new cream and 50% in the group who received emollient alone. However, the
difference is found to be not statistically significant (p = 0.14). The physician concludes that
use of the new cream does not reduce the risk of relapse in chronic recurrent atopic
dermatitis. Which of the following is most likely to explain the results of the study?

A. Ascertainment bias (3%)

B. Confounding bias (5%)

C. Ecologic fallacy (1%)

D. Insufficient statistical power (89%)

E. Recall bias (0%)
