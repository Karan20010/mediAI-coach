A study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of a new drug, KM28. The study will compare
KM28 plus standard care versus standard care alone with regard to decreasing the incidence
of recurrent breast cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will approve the new
drug if KM28 plus standard care decreases the rate of breast cancer recurrence by at least
40% compared to standard therapy alone. The recurrence rate on standard therapy is found

to be 8%. In order for the FDA to approve KM28, what is the maximal incidence of recurrent
disease acceptable for women treated with KM28 plus standard therapy?
