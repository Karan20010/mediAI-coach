Research studies are broadly classified as having an observational or experimental design
depending on the control the researcher has over the independent variables (eg, exposure to

risk factors, treatments).

¢ In observational studies (eg, case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-
sectional studies), the researcher has no control over the independent variables (eg,

exposures, risk factors).

¢ In experimental studies (eg, randomized controlled trials), the researcher controls and
randomly assigns the independent variables (eg, treatments, interventions).

A case-control study is an observational design in which potential participants are initially
identified as cases or controls according to the dependent variable or outcome (eg,
disease of interest). In the study described above, subjects age 20-84 newly diagnosed with
pulmonary tuberculosis are cases, and subjects without pulmonary tuberculosis are controls.
Once cases and controls are identified, the presence of past exposure to 21 risk factors of
interest is determined in each group. In this study, the risk factor is selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use ("never users" are subjects who never had a prescription for an
SSRI, and "users" are subjects who have had a prescription for an SSRI). Finally, the
frequency of exposure to the risk factor is compared between cases and controls to estimate
