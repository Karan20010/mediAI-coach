A 62-year-old man with diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia comes to the emergency
department of an academic medical center with chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and
diaphoresis. An electrocardiogram demonstrates ST elevation in the anterior leads, and
cardiac enzymes are markedly elevated. Investigators at the center are designing a
randomized control trial to test the hypothesis that drug B will decrease the mortality

associated with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction compared to standard of care. To
ensure that investigators will not miss a difference between drug B and standard of care (if a
difference truly exists), which of the following would they want to maximize?
