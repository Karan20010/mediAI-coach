Question Id: 1184

A case-control study was conducted to estimate the association between simvastatin therapy

and serum levels of fibrinogen in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention.

Cases were identified as patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and had
high periprocedural levels of fibrinogen (>400 mg/dL), and controls were identified as patients

who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions but had normal levels of fibrinogen (200-

400 mg/dL). History of simvastatin therapy use was assessed through chart review for every

patient. The number of patients corresponding to each classification criteria is given in the

table below.
