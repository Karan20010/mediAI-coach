oxfendazole, an anthelminthic agent. As part of the study, increasing oral doses of

oxfendazole (0.5 to 60 mg/kg) are administered to healthy volunteers. Data is collected to

form a pharmacokinetic profile of the drug and its metabolites, and the incidence of adverse

effects is recorded for the various dosages. A total of 20 healthy male and female

(nonchildbearing potential) volunteers participate in the study. Oxfendazole is found to be well

tolerated throughout the dose range without any serious adverse effects or deaths. Which of
