The attributable risk percent in the exposed (ARP.x5.:ea) is an important measure of the

7 impact of a risk factor. ARPoroces represents the excess risk in an exposed population that can

: be explained by exposure to a particular risk factor. It is calculated using the following formula:

ARPaxposea = 100 x [(risk in exposed — risk in unexposed)/risk in exposed]

This basic definition can be used to derive an equivalent formula involving relative risk (RR):

ARPixposea = 100 x [(RR — 1)/RR], where RR = risk in exposed/risk in unexposed

Applying the formula to this example:

ARP 50:23 = 100 * [(RR — 1)/RR] = 100 x [(5 — 1)/5] = 100 x (4/5) = 100 x 0.8 = 80%
Therefore, according to the study results, 80% of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases
in smokers were attributable to smoking.

The ARPaxsoses iS related to the attributable risk (AR), which is simply the difference between risk

in the exposed and risk in the unexposed.
