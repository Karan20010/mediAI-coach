(eg, exposures, risk factors) variables in a study determines the correct statistical test for any
given situation.

The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compares the means of 23 groups. It requires a
categorical independent variable (ie, exposure) that is used to divide the study pool into 23
groups and a quantitative dependent variable (ie, outcome) for which an average (eg, mean)
can be calculated. In this study:

¢ The quantitative dependent variable was the levels of creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB).

¢ The categorical independent variable was type of statin therapy that was used to
categorize 4 different groups of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM): Group |
(atorvastatin), Group II (simvastatin), Group III (rosuvastatin), and Group IV (no statin).

An ANOVA test can determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean
levels of CK-MB among T2DM patients given different statin therapies. A large, statistically
significant difference in mean CK-MB levels among groups indicates that different statin
therapies are associated with significant changes in CK-MB levels (ie, the null hypothesis is
rejected).

(Choice B) The chi-square test evaluates the association between 2 categorical variables, as
