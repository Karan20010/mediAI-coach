According to estimates by the American Cancer Society, the most common cancers (excluding
basal and squamous cell skin cancer) in 2019 among women living in the United States are
(by order of incidence) breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. Although breast cancer has the
highest incidence (268,600), its mortality is relatively low (41,760) due to early detection
while the tumor is still localized. In contrast, the incidence of lung cancer in women is lower
(111,710), but its mortality is higher (66,020), in part because lung cancer tends to be
detected later and is less localized (Choice B). Lung cancer has emerged as the leading
cause of cancer mortality in women.

(Choices C and D) The incidence of ovarian (22,530) and cervical (13,170) cancers is much
lower than that of the three cancers presented in the figure.

(Choice E) The incidence (67,100) and mortality (23,380) of colorectal cancer are lower than
that of either breast or lung cancer.

Educational objective:

According to 2019 estimates, the most common cancers (excluding basal and squamous cell
skin cancer) in women by order of incidence are breast, lung, and colorectal cancer. In terms
of mortality, lung cancer claims the most lives, followed by breast and colorectal cancer.
