Absolute risk increase = 0.60 — 0.575 = 0.025 (ie, 2.5%)

The absolute risk increase attributable to the treatment is 2.5% (60% risk of being dead at 1
year in the treatment group compared to 57.5% in the control group). The NNH then is simply
the inverse of the absolute risk increase:

NNH = 1 / 0.025 = 40

This result indicates that, on average, 40 patients need to be treated with a zeracizumab-
containing regimen for 1 additional person to experience an adverse event (ie, death in 1
year).

Note that the data is NOT presented in the standard format of a contingency (2 x 2) table, so

care should be exercised in selecting the appropriate values and applying the formulas (see
alternate solution).

Educational objective:
The number needed to harm (NNH) represents the number of people who must be treated
before 1 additional adverse event occurs. In order to calculate NNH, the absolute risk

increase between the treatment and control groups must be known: NNH = 1 / Absolute risk
