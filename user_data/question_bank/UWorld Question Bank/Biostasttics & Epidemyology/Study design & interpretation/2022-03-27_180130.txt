This observational study is analyzing population-level data to evaluate the association
between a potential exposure (eg, low socioeconomic status population) and a given outcome
(eg, increased cancer mortality). Using population-level (rather than individual-level) data as a
unit of analysis in such a manner is consistent with an ecological study. Ecological studies
are useful for generating hypotheses but should not be used to draw conclusions regarding
individuals within these populations (ecological fallacy).

(Choices A and B) Case-control and cohort studies deal with individuals rather than
populations. In case-control studies, the odds of exposure to a certain characteristic (eg,
personal socioeconomic status) are compared between affected individuals (eg, patients with
cancer) and unaffected individuals who serve as controls. In cohort studies, individuals with
and without different exposures (eg, high or low personal socioeconomic status) are followed
over time to determine the incidence of the disease of interest (eg, cancer).

(Choice C) Cross-sectional surveys evaluate the exposures and outcomes of interest in
individuals (not populations) at a given point in time ("snapshot"). The overall design of this
multi-country study relies on population-level data, not individual-level data.

(Choice E) Nested case-control studies start with cohort studies in which participants are

followed over time; those participants who develop an outcome of interest become cases for a
