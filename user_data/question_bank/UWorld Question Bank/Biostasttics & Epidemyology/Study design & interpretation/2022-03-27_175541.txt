(Choice A) A meta-analysis combines results from different studies, thereby increasing
sample size, which increases power (eg, to detect statistical differences between groups).

(Choice B) Logistic regression was used because it analyzes the association between
exposures (eg, multiple loci) and binary outcomes (eg, yes = cases with RA; no = controls
without RA).

(Choice C) An odds ratio (OR) <1 does not imply a lack of statistically significant association.
If an OR >1 means that patients with RA have higher odds of having a specific locus compared
to those without RA (ie, risk factor), an OR <1 means that patients with RA have /ower odds of
having that specific locus (ie, protective factor). The OR for the association between Locus 1
and RA is statistically significant because its p-value (3.5 x 10+) is less than the genome-wide

p-value (5 x 10-).

(Choice E) GWAS help explain disease heritability (ie, effect of genotypic differences on
phenotypic differences). Although this study identified 3 new loci, there is no indication that the
full group of 33 loci will explain most RA disease heritability. GWAS have identified many
genes associated with specific conditions, but these genes only seem to explain a small
amount of the variance ("missing heritability").
