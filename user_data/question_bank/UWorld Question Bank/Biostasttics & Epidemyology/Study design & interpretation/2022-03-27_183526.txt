association between the risk factors and the outcomes.

(Choice B) Acase series study is a descriptive study that tracks patients with a known
condition (eg, exposure, risk factor, disease) to document the natural history or response to
treatment. Unlike a case-control study, a case series is purely descriptive and cannot
establish associations.

(Choice C) Cross-sectional studies may evaluate associations between risk factors and
outcomes of interest. However, unlike in case-control studies (participants selected based on
the outcome status), the participants in a cross-sectional study are selected based on the
inclusion and exclusion criteria set for the study.

(Choice D) In cohort studies, 2 groups of individuals (ie, cohorts) are initially identified based
on their exposure status to a specific risk factor (eg, environmental lead exposure) rather than
based on their outcome status (eg, cognitive deficits), as seen in this example. The cohorts
are then followed over time for development of the outcome.

(Choice E) Arandomized clinical trial would follow individuals who have been randomized to
either a treatment arm or a control arm and compare the effect of the intervention.
