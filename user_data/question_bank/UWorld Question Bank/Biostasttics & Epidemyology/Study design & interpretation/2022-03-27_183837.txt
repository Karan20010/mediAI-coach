(Choice B) The chi-square test evaluates the association between 2 categorical variables, as
in a study evaluating the association between sex (ie, "male" and "female") and myocardial
infarction (ie, presence of myocardial infarction, absence of myocardial infarction).

(Choices C and D) The t-tests compare the mean of a quantitative variable between 2
groups. A paired t-test is used when the groups are dependent (eg, comparing mean blood
pressure [quantitative variable] in the same group of patients before and after antihypertensive
therapy). An independent t-test is used when the groups are independent (eg, comparing
mean CK-MB levels [quantitative variable] between a group of patients given statin therapy
and another not given statin therapy).

(Choice E) Acorrelation analysis uses the correlation coefficient to describe the linear
relationship between 2 quantitative variables, as in a study evaluating the linear relationship
between hours of sleep and irritability score.

Educational objective:

The analysis of variance test compares the means of 23 groups. The test requires a
categorical independent variable (ie, exposure) that is used to divide the study pool into 23
groups and a quantitative dependent variable (ie, outcome) for which an average (eg, mean)

can be calculated.
