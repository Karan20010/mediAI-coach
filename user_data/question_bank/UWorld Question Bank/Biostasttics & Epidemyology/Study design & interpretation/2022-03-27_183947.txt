Researchers are studying the relationship between essential hypertension and a common
mutation in the structure of a sodium channel protein. A study population is randomly selected
and blood samples are obtained for leukocyte genotyping. The prevalence of hypertension is
determined based on mean blood pressure measurements obtained using standardized

ambulatory blood pressure monitoring conducted over 1 week. Based on the analysis results,
the researchers conclude that the sodium channel structure mutation is associated with
hypertension. Which of the following best describes the study design used by the
investigators?

A. Case-control study (10%)
YB. Cross-sectional study (56%)

C. Prospective cohort study (17%)

D. Randomized clinical trial (9%)

E. Retrospective cohort study (6%)
