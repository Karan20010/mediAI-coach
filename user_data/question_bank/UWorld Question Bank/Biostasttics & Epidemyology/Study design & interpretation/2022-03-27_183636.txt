specifications or drop out of the study, then their outcomes should be attributed to that
intervention (ie, nonadherence is related to the practical benefits of treatment). ITT analysis
also helps avoid the effects of attrition (eg, loss to follow-up, dropout) and crossover (eg,
switching to another assigned intervention), which may disrupt the benefit of randomization
and introduce bias in the estimation of the effect of the intervention.

ITT analysis may lead to a more conservative estimate of the effect of the intervention. If
attrition or crossover is significant, ITT analysis may be less likely to identify a statistically
significant difference between treatments (ie, shift toward the null hypothesis). However,
results will reflect the expected effect of the intervention in a practical clinical setting.

(Choices A, C, and D) In accordance with ITT analysis, the investigator in this case should
keep the 12 nonadherent patients in their respective groups for analysis.

(Choice B) An analysis that includes only those patients who strictly adhered to a research
protocol (ie, excluding all nonadherent patients from analysis) follows a per-protocol (PP)
