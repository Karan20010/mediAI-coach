A case-control study is an observational study design in which potential participants are
initially identified as cases or controls according to their disease status (ie, have or do not

have the disease of interest).

In the study described above, a cohort of adults newly diagnosed with hepatitis C (HCV)
represents the cases, and a cohort of HCV-negative adults represents the controls. Note that
"cohort" in this case refers to a group of individuals with similar characteristics (eg, HCV-
positivity), not to a "cohort study," in which a group of individuals are followed over time.

Once cases and controls are identified, the frequency of past exposure to 21 risk factors of
interest is compared between cases and controls to estimate the association between the risk
factors and the outcomes. Therefore, an appropriate measure for the proposed study would
be any event that preceded HCV infection. Among the given choices, a history of past
blood transfusions precedes HCV infection.

Because of the retrospective nature of a case-control study, this study design is not able to
compare the frequency (ie, incidence, risk, rate) of any event that occurs after a disease has
been diagnosed (ie, prospective outcomes). Prospective outcomes are reasonable in cohort
studies and experimental designs (Choices A, C, D, and E).
