Educational objective:

Observer bias occurs when the investigator's evaluation is affected by preconceived
expectations or prior knowledge, typically leading to overestimation of the disease association
or treatment effects. This type of bias can be reduced by conducting a blinded study in which
observers are unaware of study details and patient characteristics that could unduly influence

them.
