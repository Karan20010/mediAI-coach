Combining the results of the European and Portuguese studies into a meta-analysis
decreases the power

Logistic regression is used because there is a stepwise increase in the strength of
association from Locus 1 to Locus 3

The association between Locus 1 and RA in the meta-analysis is not statistically
significant because the odds ratio is <1

The threshold used for the p-value in the meta-analysis is 5 x 10-: because of the
large number of loci studied

With this meta-analysis, the 33 identified loci account for most disease heritability in
RA
