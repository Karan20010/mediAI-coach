(Choice B) Effect modification results when an external variable positively or negatively

impacts the observed effect of a risk factor on disease status. When analysis is performed

based on stratification by this external variable, there will be a significant difference in risk

between the stratified groups. For instance, aspirin use is associated with Reye syndrome in

children but not adults; therefore, age modifies the effect of aspirin on Reye syndrome

development. Effect modification can easily be confused with confounding; but stratified

analysis can help distinguish between them. With confounding, there is usually no significant

difference between the strata (as in this case with the smoker and non-smoker strata).

(Choices C and E) Measurement bias and observer bias distort the strength of association by
misclassifying exposed/unexposed and/or diseased/nondiseased subjects. The scenario does
not describe any issues that could affect the classification process.

(Choice D) Meta-analysis refers to compiling results from several studies to increase analysis
power.

(Choice F) Recall bias results from inaccurate recall of past exposure by people in the study

and applies mostly to retrospective (eg, case-control) studies.
