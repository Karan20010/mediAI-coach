Scatter plots are useful for crude data analysis. If a linear association is present between 2
variables, a correlation coefficient (r) mathematically describes how well a "line of best fit"
(blue line in Figure) would correspond to the data points plotted. The value of r ranges from
-1 to +1 and describes 2 important characteristics of an association: the strength and the
polarity. The closer the r value is to its margins [-1, 1], the stronger the association.

An increase in C-reactive protein (CRP) level is associated with a decrease in the new
marker's level; therefore, r <0. Although the scatter plot does not demonstrate a perfect linear
arrangement, it does show a reasonably strong linear association as there is minimal variation
along the line of best fit (points are relatively close to the line). Therefore, the most
appropriate answer among the options given is r = -0.8.

(Choices A and B) In this example, r cannot be >0 as an increase in CRP level is associated
with a decrease in the new marker's level.

(Choice C) Anr =0 indicates that there is no association (ie, a random distribution).

(Choice D) Anr = -0.2 would also indicate a negative association; however, there would be
more variation along the line of best fit (as seen in the Figure).

The value of ris not the slope of the line of best fit. For instance, assuming a data set with a
