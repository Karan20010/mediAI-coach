exposure between the case and control groups Is what determines whether the exposure Is
more prevalent among cases as compared to controls.

Ideally, exposure frequency among controls should be representative of that among the
population of individuals "at risk" of becoming cases. In other words, for a given case-control
study, controls are nondiseased individuals who could be considered cases if they had the
disease. Often, controls and cases are matched based on independent variables (eg, age,
sex) to decrease the effects of confounding.

(Choices D, E, and F) AML is the outcome of interest; therefore, children who have AML can
be used only to form the cases group and cannot be used as controls. Cases should also be
selected regardless of exposure status.

Educational objective:

Selection of control subjects in case-control studies is intended to provide an accurate
estimation of exposure frequency among the nondiseased general population. Cases and
controls should be selected based on disease status, not exposure status.
