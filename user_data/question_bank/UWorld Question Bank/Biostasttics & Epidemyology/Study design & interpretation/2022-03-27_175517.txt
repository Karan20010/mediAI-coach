: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is performed in a cohort

6 of Portuguese patients, including 907 cases with RA and 1,524 controls without RA. Logistic
regression is used to test the association between RA and hundreds of thousands of loci.

: 9 These association results are then compared with data from a European GWAS cohort of
4,036 patients with RA and 6,959 patients without RA. Finally, the Portuguese and European
study results are combined into a meta-analysis. Based on these data, the investigators
identify 3 new loci that are associated with RA based on a significance level threshold of 5 x
10°:

European study Portuguese study Meta-analysis

Odds ratio p-value | Oddsratio p-value | Odds ratio p-value

Locus 1 0.53 8.36 x 107 0.61 0.013 0.55 3.5 x 10
Locus 2 1.16 8.40 x 107 1.14 0.019 1.16 4.9 x 108

Locus 3 1.63 0.0000015 1.77 0.0074 1.66 4.1.x 10+

Previous studies had identified 30 loci that accounted for <35% of disease heritability for RA.
