A normal (Gaussian) distribution refers to a symmetrical, bell-shaped distribution with a
fixed proportion of observations lying within a certain distance of the mean. This distance is
called the standard deviation (SD) and reflects the degree of dispersion from the mean.
According to the properties of this distribution, 68% of observations lie within 1 SD from the
mean, with half (ie, 68/2 = 34%) above and half (34%) below the mean. The remaining 32% (=
100% - 68%) lie outside 1 SD from the mean, with half (ie, 32/2 = 16%) above and the other
half (16%) below 1 SD from the mean. In addition, 95% of all observations lie within 2 SD of
the mean, and 99.7% of all observations lie within 3 SD from the mean. This is the 68-95-99.7
rule.

The 95% range for this marker with a mean of 0.06 U/mL is 0.04 to 0.08 U/mL; given a normal
distribution, this represents the range given by mean + 2 SD. Therefore, 1 SD = 0.01
(because 0.04 = mean - 2 SD = 0.06 —- 2 SD = 0.06 - 2 x 0.01 and, similarly, 0.08 = 0.06 + 2 x
0.01). The 99.7% range is given by mean + 3 SD; therefore, the 99.7% range is 0.03 (= mean
- 3 SD = 0.06 - 3 x 0.01) to 0.09 (= mean + 3 SD = 0.06 + 3 x 0.01). Any result that falls
outside this range (eg, a value exceeding this range) indicates that the value is different from
what is seen in 99.7% of the reference population.

In laboratory measurements, although 95% is often used as a reference range, a 99% range is
