= A sample mean is a point estimate of the true population mean; however, a confidence
5 interval (Cl) better accounts for the variability due to sampling by including the SE in its
: calculation. The Cl of the mean can be calculated as follows:
: Cl of mean = mean + [z-score for confidence level] x [SE]
: s where the z-score for confidence level represents the number of SEs containing the desired
percentage of observations around the mean (eg, 95%, 99%). In this case, the 95% Cl can be

calculated:

Cl of mean = mean # 1.96 x (SD/Vn)
The sample size and the SD of the sample determine the magnitude of the variability due to
sampling. As n increases, SE decreases, and the Cl becomes narrower and more precise.
Conversely, as the SD increases, SE increases, and the Cl becomes wider and less precise.
(Choice A) Cl estimates use the SE of the mean, which takes into account the SD and the
size of the sample (n). As such, the equation divides the SD by the square root of n.
(Choices C, D, and E) As noted, the SD reflects the spread of individual values in a normal

distribution. Multiplying the SD by a specific constant (z-score) gives us a range of values that
encompass a certain proportion of the observations. The mean + 1 x SD would cover 68% of
