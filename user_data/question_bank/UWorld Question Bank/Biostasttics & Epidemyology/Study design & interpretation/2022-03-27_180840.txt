Question Id: 8519

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any significant
differences between the means of several independent groups.

ANOVA compares the means between the groups relative to the variability within groups (F-
test) and determines whether any of those means are significantly different from one another.
Specifically, it tests the null hypothesis that all groups are simply random samples of the
same population (ie, the means are the same). The null hypothesis is rejected when there
are at least 2 group means that are significantly different from one another.

ANOVA can be used to compare 22 groups but is generally used to compare 23 groups
(because other equivalent methods exist to compare 2 groups). For example, the 2
independent samples t-test is a special case of the F-test in ANOVA. The assumptions for
both tests and their resulting p-values are the same.

(Choice B) Chi-square tests can be used to evaluate the association between 2 categorical
variables. For example, if FEV, is measured as a categorical variable (eg, normal or low), then
a chi-square test could be used to determine if there is an association between FEV, and
smoking status. However, this study is specifically comparing the mean FEV, results (a

quantitative variable) between groups.
