(Choice C) Actlinical trial is an experimental study in which patients are prospectively
assigned to 22 interventions (often including a placebo or control treatment) to evaluate the
effects of those interventions on outcomes of interest.

(Choice E) Across-sectional study is an observational study that assesses a population of
interest (eg, all women of reproductive age) at a single point in time; it can be used to estimate
disease prevalence and association with risk factors of interest. However, it is not used to
characterize disease findings because subjects are not selected based on the presence of
disease.

Educational objective:

A case series is a descriptive observational study design in which a group of patients with a
similar diagnosis or treatment is described at a point in time or followed over a certain period.
This study design has no comparison group; therefore, it cannot establish associations
between risk factors (eg, treatments) and outcomes (eg, diseases).
