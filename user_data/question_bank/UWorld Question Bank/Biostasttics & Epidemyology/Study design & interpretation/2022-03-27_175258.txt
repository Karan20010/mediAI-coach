assessed by recording the incidence and severity of infections in each group.

(Choice A) A case-control study is a type of observational study in which potential participants
are initially identified as cases or controls according to outcome status (ie, developing the
disease or condition of interest); the 2 groups are then assessed on their past exposure to
specific risk factors.

(Choice B) Acrossover study is an experiment in which subjects are exposed to different
treatments or exposures sequentially. In the above scenario, patients are exposed to a single
treatment only.

(Choices C and E) In prospective cohort studies, exposure status is determined in the
present and patients are tracked over time for development of the outcome of interest; in
retrospective cohort studies, exposure status is determined at a particular point in the past,
and participants are tracked retrospectively, typically through their medical records. However,
participants in cohort studies already have a definite exposure status; they are not randomly
assigned to exposure groups as in the above example.

Educational objective:
A randomized control trial is an experiment in which participants are randomly allocated to 22

groups to assess the effect of specific interventions (eg, treatments).
