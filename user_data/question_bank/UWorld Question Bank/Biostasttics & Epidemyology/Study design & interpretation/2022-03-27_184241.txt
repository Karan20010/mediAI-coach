Question Id: 1280

Antioxidant use for 25 years was associated with a statistically significant (p < 0.01)
decreased risk of stroke (relative risk [RR] = 0.75 <1). By contrast, antioxidant use for <5
years demonstrated a nonstatistically significant (p > 0.05) smaller reduction in risk (RR =
0.95); in other words, antioxidant use for <5 years seems to have no benefit on stroke risk
reduction. This discrepancy can be explained if reduction in stroke risk is associated with the
duration of exposure to antioxidant supplementation; in other words, a minimum cumulative
exposure to antioxidants may be necessary for the exposure to have a significant effect on

stroke risk.

This concept of accumulation effect can apply to both risk factors and risk reducers. The
effect of exposure to risk factors may depend on the duration and intensity of the exposure;
long-term exposure may be necessary well before an effect on the disease process is clinically
evident (eg, lung cancer developing after decades of smoking exposure). Similarly, exposure
to certain risk reducers must occur continuously over extended periods before disease
outcome is affected. In this case, 25 years of continuous antioxidant use (risk reducer) were
required to reveal their protective effect on stroke.

(Choice B) Lead time is the time between the initial detection of a disease and a specific
outcome or measured endpoint. Lead-time bias can occur when a test detects or diagnoses
