aiterence), and

(Choice A) Ascertainment bias occurs when the results of a study are distorted by awareness
of treatment assignment, as in an unblind study. This study is double-blinded, thereby
minimizing potential ascertainment bias.

(Choice B) Confounding distorts the relationship between exposures (eg, treatments) and the
outcome (eg, disease) of interest, and can wholly or partially account for observed effects.
This study is a randomized trial, thereby minimizing potential confounding bias by generating
groups that are comparable with respect to known and unknown confounding variables.

(Choice C) Ecological fallacy occurs when conclusions are made about individuals based on
studies where the unit of analysis is a group (ie, the conclusions of a study assessing
population groups do not necessarily apply to individuals). In this study, the unit of analysis is
the individual, not the group.

(Choice E) Recall bias results from the inaccurate recollection of past exposure status. Itis a
potential problem for case-control studies, particularly when questionnaires are used to inquire
about distant past exposure. However, this study is an experiment in which patients are
exposed to treatments and then assessed for the outcome.
