Observational studies (eg, case series, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional
studies) differ from experimental studies (eg, clinical trials) in that the researchers passively
observe the study participants rather than monitor the result of a specific intervention.
Observational studies can be subdivided as follows:

¢ Descriptive studies collect data to characterize a specific health problem (eg, disease
prevalence, incidence rates).

e Analytical studies test hypotheses to evaluate associations between risk factors and
disease.

A case-control study is an analytical observational design in which potential participants are
initially identified as "cases" or "controls" according to an outcome status (ie, disease of
interest). In this example, children diagnosed with cognitive deficits are cases and children
without cognitive deficits are controls. Once identified, cases and controls are then assessed
retrospectively for exposure to risk factors of interest. In this case, the risk factor of interest
is environmental lead exposure, as measured by the distance between the patients' residence
and known lead-contaminated areas. Finally, the prevalence of exposure to the risk factors
(ie, frequency of exposure) is compared between cases and controls to estimate the
association between the risk factors and the outcomes.
