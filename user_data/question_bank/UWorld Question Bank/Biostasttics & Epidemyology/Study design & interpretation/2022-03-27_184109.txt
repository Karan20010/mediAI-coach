(Choice C) Aphase Il trial assesses treatment efficacy in a small number of affected subjects
(ie, those with the disease of interest), rather than in healthy subjects. For example, a phase II
study would assess efficacy, optimal dosing, and adverse effects of oxfendazole among
subjects with helminth infection. The study above evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic
profile, and metabolism of oxfendazole in a small number of healthy subjects.

(Choice D) Aphase Ill trial assesses the safety and effectiveness of a new treatment
compared to a standard treatment (or placebo); therefore, it involves 22 groups of affected
subjects. For example, a phase III study would evaluate the effectiveness of oxfendazole
compared to placebo among subjects with helminth infection.

(Choice E) A phase IV trial studies the adverse effects caused over time by a new treatment
after it has been approved and is on the market, as with a study to assess adverse effects

related to oxfendazole use not seen in earlier trials.

Educational objective:

A phase | trial assesses the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety profile (eg,
adverse events, toxicity) of a new treatment in humans. It is usually conducted on a small
number of healthy subjects.
