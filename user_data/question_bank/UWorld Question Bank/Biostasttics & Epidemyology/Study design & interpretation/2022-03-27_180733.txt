Question Id: 1303
The first study and the meta-analysis (combined results of several studies) had similar
outcomes in terms of relative risk (RR); however, they arrived at different conclusions because
the p-value reached statistical significance (p <a = 0.05) in the meta-analysis but not in the first
study. The most probable reason behind this is that the larger meta-analysis reflects the true
status (increased risk of myocardial infarction [MI] with hormone replacement therapy [HRT]),
whereas the first study result represented a type Il (B) error (falsely concluded there was no
increased risk of MI with HRT).

The probability of a type II (8) error is related to how much power a study has to detect a
difference when a difference actually exists (power = 1-8). Sample size and power are
related in that studies with a larger sample size have greater power to detect differences if
these exist. The small sample size of the first study made it underpowered to detect a
difference in outcome between patients who were treated with HRT and those who were not.

The sample size did not change the value of a (typically set at 0.05). However, because the
first study was underpowered, the p-value obtained was not statistically significant (p = 0.07 >a
= 0.05), leading to a false conclusion of no increased risk of MI with HRT.

(Choice A) Berkson's bias refers to selection bias that can be created by selecting
hospitalized patients as the control group.
