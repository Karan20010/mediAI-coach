The number needed to treat (NNT) represents the number of patients that need to be treated
with a medication (eg, Superstatin) in order to prevent an additional negative outcome (eg,
myocardial infarction). NNT is calculated by dividing 1 by the absolute risk reduction (ARR).
NNT =1/ARR

ARR represents the actual difference in control and experimental group event rates. The data
is not presented in the standard format of a contingency (2 x 2) table, so care should be
exercised in selecting the appropriate values. In this example, the event of interest is
myocardial infarction. There were 25 + 975 = 1,000 patients in the control group; of those, 25
had a myocardial infarction. Similarly, there were 10 + 990 = 1,000 patients in the treatment
(ie, Superstatin) group; of those, 10 had a myocardial infarction. Therefore:

Control event rate = 25 / 1,000 = 0.025
Experimental event rate = 10 / 1,000 = 0.01
ARR can then be calculated:
ARR = Control event rate — Experimental event rate = 0.025 — 0.01 = 0.015, or 1.5%
Finally, NNT is found by dividing 1 by 0.015:
