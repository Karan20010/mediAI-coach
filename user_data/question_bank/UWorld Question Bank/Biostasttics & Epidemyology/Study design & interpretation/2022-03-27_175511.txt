(Choice A) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compares the mean of a quantitative
variable of 23 independent groups. For example, it could be used in a study comparing serum
ferritin concentrations (ie, quantitative variable) in children (age 0-12), adolescents (age 13-
17), adults (age 18-59), and seniors (age 260).

(Choice B) Meta-analysis is a quantitative statistical technique used to combine and analyze
data from several studies to conduct an analysis with a greater statistical power than that of
the individual studies.

(Choices C and E) The odds ratio (OR) and the relative risk (RR) measure the strength of
association between 2 categorical variables: a categorical risk factor (eg, smoker

or nonsmoker) and a categorical outcome/disease (eg, presence or absence of myocardial
infarction). The OR is used in case-control studies whereas the RR is used in cohort studies.

Educational objective:

A regression analysis is a statistical technique used to describe the effect that 1 or more
independent variables (eg, exposures, risk factors), which may be quantitative or qualitative,
can have on 1 quantitative dependent variable (ie, outcome).
