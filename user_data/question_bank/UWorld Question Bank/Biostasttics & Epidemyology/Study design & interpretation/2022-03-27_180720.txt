Researchers studying the effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the risk of

myocardial infarction (Ml) among postmenopausal women calculate the relative risk (RR) of Ml

to be 1.30 (p = 0.07) among women who are taking HRT compared to those who are not. The

researchers conclude that there is no statistically significant increased risk of MI with HRT

(based on a cutoff of a = 0.05). Subsequently, the results of a meta-analysis determine that
there actually is an increased risk of MI, with an overall RR = 1.32 (p = 0.03) among
postmenopausal women who are taking HRT compared to those who are not. Which of the

following was the most likely problem in the first study?

SY E. Sample size (77%)

A. Berkson's bias (7%)
B. Placebo effect (1%)
C. Poor blinding (3%)

D. Researcher expectancy (9%)
