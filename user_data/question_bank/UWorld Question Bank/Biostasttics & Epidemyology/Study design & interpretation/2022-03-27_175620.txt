(Choice C) Length-time bias occurs when subjects with a rapidly progressive form of disease
are less likely to be detected by screening compared to those with slowly progressive disease.
This bias tends to overstate the beneficial effects of screening on length of survival and
mortality. In this case, there is no indication that the patients identified by the new test have
more benign forms of lung cancer.

(Choices D and E) Measurement bias and observer bias refer to the misclassification of
outcome and/or exposure (eg, labeling diseased as non-diseased and vice versa) and are
related to poor study design. The scenario described does not mention how the study was
conducted.

(Choice F) Rare disease assumption refers to the practice of approximating the odds ratio
and relative risk when conducting a case-control study for rare diseases. According to the
assumption, the odds ratio approximates relative risk when disease incidence is low (eg,
<10%).

Educational objective:

Lead-time bias occurs when a new test diagnoses a condition earlier than conventional

studies, causing an apparent increase in survival time despite no improvement in overall
mortality. Long-term mortality rates, not survival times, should be considered for measuring
