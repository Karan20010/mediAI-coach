Unfortunately, not all interventions or new treatments end up helping patients. The number

needed to harm (NNH) represents the number of people who must be treated before 1

additional adverse event occurs. It is calculated in a manner similar to the number needed to

treat (NNT) but using the absolute risk increase (attributable risk) instead of the absolute risk

reduction:

NNH = 1/ Absolute risk increase

To determine the absolute risk increase, first calculate the adverse event rate (eg, death) in
the experimental and control groups. In this case, the adverse event of interest is death at 1
year. There were 40 + 60 = 100 people treated with the experimental treatment (ie,
zeracizumab-containing regimen); of those, 60 were dead at 1 year. Similarly, there were 51 +
69 = 120 people treated with standard chemotherapy; of those, 69 were dead at 1 year.
Therefore:

Adverse event rate in experimental group = 60 / 100 = 0.60 (ie, 60%)
Adverse event rate in control group = 69 / 120 = 0.575 (ie, 57.5%)
The absolute risk increase can then be calculated by subtracting the adverse event rate in
the control group from the adverse event rate in the treatment group:
