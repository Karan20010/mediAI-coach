myelogenous leukemia (AML) among children age 5-12 in their community. They observe that

chemical waste is associated with AML in childhood. Which of the following populations
should be selected as the control group?

A. Children who do not have AML and are exposed to chemical waste (19%)

ZY C. Children who do not have AML, regardless of exposure status to chemical waste
(30%)
