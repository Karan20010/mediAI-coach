Therefore, the cases are young athletes with a diagnosis of AIS irrespective of SIJ status; the
controls are young athletes with no diagnosis of AIS irrespective of SIJ status because

what determines whether the disease (ie, AIS) is associated with the risk factor (ie, SlJ) is the
difference in the frequency of the risk factor between cases and controls.

Educational objective:

A case-control study is an observational study design; it begins with individuals who have the
outcome ("cases") and compares them with individuals who do not have the outcome
("controls") according to history of exposure to 21 risk factors.
