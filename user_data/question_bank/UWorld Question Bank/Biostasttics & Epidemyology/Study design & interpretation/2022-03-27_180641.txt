(Choices A and C) Type | error occurs when researchers reject the null hypothesis when the
null hypothesis is really true. That is, a study finds a statistically significant difference between
2 groups when one does not truly exist. An example would be if a study concluded that candy
improves heart failure mortality when, in fact, it does not. a is the maximum probability of
making a type | error that a researcher is willing to accept. Generally, a is compared to the p-
value, the probability of observing a given result (or more extreme) due to chance alone
assuming the null hypothesis is true (eg, if there is no real difference between the groups).
The value of a is typically set at 0.05, meaning that researchers are willing to accept up toa
5% chance of making a type | error. In such a scenario, if p <0.05, the result is said to be
statistically significant.

Educational objective:
Power (1 - B) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is truly false. It is typically
set at 80% and depends on sample size and difference between outcomes.
