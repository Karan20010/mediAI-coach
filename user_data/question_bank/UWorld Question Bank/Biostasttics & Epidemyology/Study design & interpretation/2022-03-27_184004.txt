A cross-sectional study (also known as a prevalence study) simultaneously measures
exposures and outcomes. The cross-sectional study has a "snapshot" design that is
frequently used in surveys, mostly because it is inexpensive and easy to perform. In this
example, a snapshot was obtained of individuals randomly selected from the population; their
blood samples were analyzed for the presence of the sodium channel protein mutation and the
prevalence of hypertension was calculated. The subjects' blood pressure was measured over
7 days to obtain an average measurement (likely to limit the results being impacted by white-
coat hypertension and other transient causes of hypertension). The major limitation of a cross-
sectional study design is that a temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is not
always clear. However, in this case, demonstrating a temporal relationship was
straightforward because the possession of a specific genotype clearly precedes hypertension.

(Choice A) A case-control study is designed by selecting individuals with a particular disease
(cases), individuals without that disease (controls), and then evaluating previous exposure
status. This study would have been classified as a case-control study if it had explicitly
recruited individuals with (cases) and without (controls) hypertension (rather than randomly
selecting a sample from a population) and evaluated their sodium channel mutation patterns.

(Choices C and E) A prospective cohort study would have taken individuals without
