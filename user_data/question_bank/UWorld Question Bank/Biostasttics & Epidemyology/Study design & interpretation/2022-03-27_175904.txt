the observations, and the mean + 2.58 x SD would cover 99% of the observations. However,
the question is asking for a 95% Cl, so the equation should use a z-score of 1.96 and the SE
(ie, SD/Vn).

Educational objective:

The standard deviation reflects the spread of individual values in a normal distribution (ie, it
measures the variability of the observations within a single sample). The standard error of the
mean reflects the variability of means (ie, variance between the means of different samples)
and helps estimate the true mean of the underlying population.
