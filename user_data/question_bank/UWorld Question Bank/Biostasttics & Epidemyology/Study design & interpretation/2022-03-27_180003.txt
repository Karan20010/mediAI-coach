Question Id: 19398
assesses long-term safety and effectiveness and characterizes uncommon or delayed

adverse effects. It typically involves surveillance of a large number of treated participants to
detect small effects and variability in diverse patient populations. The results are often used to

refine the use of the drug in clinical practice.

(Choice E) Preclinical studies are typically conducted without human subjects (ie, bench
research) largely to determine the mechanism of action and/or make a preliminary estimation
of safety and efficacy.

Educational objective:

Phase IV (postmarketing) trials are conducted with drugs that have already been approved for
use in order to study long-term effectiveness and better characterize uncommon or delayed
adverse effects. They are typically designed to identify small treatment effects (ie, a high
power study with large numbers of participants) in diverse patient populations, and the results
may be used to refine the use of drugs in clinical practice.
