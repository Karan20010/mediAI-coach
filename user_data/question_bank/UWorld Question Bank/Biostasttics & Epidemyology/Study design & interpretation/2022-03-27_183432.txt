another variable. It can be identified using stratified analysis (analyzing the cohort as
different subgroups), as the different strata will have different measures of association. In
this scenario, smoking status modified the effect of the new estrogen receptor agonist
(exposure) on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) incidence (outcome). Using stratified analysis by
smoking status:

e« Among smokers, there was a statistically significant association between taking the new
estrogen receptor agonist and risk of developing DVT with a relative risk of >1, indicating
higher risk, and a p-value of <0.05, indicating statistical significance.

¢ In contrast, among nonsmokers, there was no statistically significant association between
taking the medication and risk of DVT (p-value >0.05).

Effect modification is not a bias (Choices D and E), as it is not due to flaws in the design or
analysis phases of the study. It is a natural phenomenon that should be described, not
corrected.

Effect modification is most easily confused with confounding (Choice A), but stratified

analysis can help distinguish between these 2 scenarios. With effect modification, the different
strata will have different measures of association, as seen in this example of the association
