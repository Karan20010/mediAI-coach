The normal distribution is a continuous distribution that follows a bell-shaped curve with a
single peak at the mean value. One of the most important properties of the normal distribution
is its symmetry about its mean, which allows for determination of the percentage of all
observations that lie within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations (SDs). The "68/95/99 rule" states
that 68% of all observations lie within 1 SD of the mean, 95% within 2 SDs of the mean, and
99.7% within 3 SDs of the mean. These are helpful approximations; however, when
considering the normal distribution, exactly 95% of the observations lie within 1.96 SDs of
the mean and 99% of the observations lie within 2.58 SDs (1.96 and 2.58 represent z-scores
for 95% and 99% of the distribution, respectively).

Most research is done using samples rather than entire populations. This introduces some
variability when calculating population parameters such as mean value (eg, when different
samples are drawn from the same population, the means from all possible samples will often
be slightly different). The variability between sample means can be calculated in a way
analogous to calculating the SD of a group of observations in a single sample. The "standard
deviation" of a series of sample means is known as the standard error (SE) of the mean, and
it estimates how far the sample mean is likely to be from the unknown population mean. The
SE is estimated considering both the SD and the size of the sample (n) in the following

manner: SD/Vn.
