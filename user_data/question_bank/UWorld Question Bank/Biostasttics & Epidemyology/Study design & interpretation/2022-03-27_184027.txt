In a reference sample of hundreds of healthy subjects, the laboratory reference range for a
novel marker of cardiac injury is 0.04-0.08 U/mL at the standard 95% level of probability. The
marker has very high sensitivity and specificity for myocardial tissue. The clinical cardiology
team would like to use a 99.7% reference range to assess patients who come to the
emergency department with chest pain and have a high pretest probability of cardiac
ischemia. An elevated value of the marker is defined as exceeding the 99.7th percentile of the
reference sample. Assuming a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean of 0.06 U/mL,

which of the following most closely approximates the corresponding reference range?

v

A. 0.03 to 0.09 (73%)

B. 0.035 to 0.085 (12%)
C. 0.045 to 0.075 (5%)

D. 0.05 to 0.07 (4%)

E. 0.055 to 0.065 (3%)
