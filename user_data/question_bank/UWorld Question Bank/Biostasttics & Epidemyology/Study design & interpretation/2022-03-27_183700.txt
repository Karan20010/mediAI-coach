4 Matching is a method generally used in the design stage of case-control studies to control
- 6 confounding (ie, when a perceived association between an exposure and an outcome is
7 actually explained by a confounding variable associated with both the exposure and the
8
9 outcome). The initial step in matching involves selecting variables that could be confounders

(eg, age, race). Cases and controls are then selected based on the matching variables so that
both groups have a similar distribution in accordance with the variables.

In this scenario, the "cases" (patients with colorectal cancer) were matched with neighborhood
"controls" of similar age and race. Selecting neighbors as controls has another advantage of
matching the cases to controls by variables that are difficult to measure (eg, socioeconomic
status, environmental factors). Gender and smoking status are other common confounders.

(Choices A, C, D, and E) Observer bias and ascertainment bias result from mislabeling
exposed/unexposed or cases/controls. Recall bias could be a limitation of this study as the
interviewed participants with colorectal cancer may be more likely to recall certain exposures.
Selection bias is a potential problem in this study because the controls selected may not reflect
the exposure experience of the general population. However, although these biases may be
present, matching best addresses confounding rather than any of these biases.
