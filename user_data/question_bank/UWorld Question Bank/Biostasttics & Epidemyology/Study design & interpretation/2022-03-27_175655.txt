A meta-analysis groups the results of several trials (ideally, high-quality randomized controlled
trials) to increase statistical power and provide an overall estimate of the effect of an exposure
(eg, cocoa intake) on an outcome (eg, systolic blood pressure [SBP]). The individual results of
the trials are assessed and weighted to obtain a pooled effect estimate. In this example, the
meta-analysis showed an overall change in mean SBP of -2.2 mm Hg (ie, decrease in SBP) in
the cocoa intake group compared to the control group. The 95% confidence interval (Cl) was
-2.7 to -1.3 mm Hg, indicating a statistically significant difference because the Cl does not
include the null value (explained below).

Cls give a range of plausible values for an unknown parameter (eg, difference between 2
mean SBPs) based on results from a sample. If the Cl does not include the null value, then
the result is statistically significant; if it crosses the null value, then the result is not
statistically significant. All Cls have a null value, but the null value is not the same for all Cls.
For an odds ratio or a relative risk (RR), the null value is 1 because these statistics are ratios
(ie, RR = 1 represents no difference in risk between the groups). However, if the parameter of
interest is a difference (eg, difference in mean SBP between cocoa intake and control
groups), then the null value is 0 because that represents no difference between the groups.

In this case, the 95% Cl of [-2.7, -1.3] does not include the null value of 0 and therefore the
