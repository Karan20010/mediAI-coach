= Question Id: 14859 a 4 (Cons
A cohort study is an observational design in which potential participants in the population of
interest are initially identified as exposed or nonexposed according to the independent
variable (ie, exposure status to a risk factor). Once participants are categorized based on their
exposure status, the occurrence (ie, incidence) of the dependent variable (eg, outcome of

interest) over a specific period is determined in each group. Finally, the occurrence of the

outcome is compared between exposed and nonexposed groups to estimate the association
between the risk factors and the outcomes. If there is a statistically significant difference in
outcome occurrence between the 2 groups, it is likely that the risk factor in question is
associated with disease development.
In this example:
¢ The population of interest is patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore,
both the exposed and nonexposed groups must consist of patients with T2DM (Choices D
and E).
¢ The risk factor of interest is morbid obesity (BMI >40 kg/mz). Therefore, the exposed
group is adults with morbid obesity, and the nonexposed group is adults with normal
weight (BMI 18.5 to <25 kg/m2) (Choice A).

¢ The outcome of interest is diabetic nephropathy. Exposed and nonexposed subjects
