The clinical trials process addresses whether new treatments (eg, drugs, procedures) are
effective and safe for their intended use (ie, treatment of a disease) in the target population
(eg, subjects with the disease of interest). New treatments go through several research
phases; some phases involve no human subjects (ie, preclinical studies) and some involve few
(ie, phase | and II trials) or many (ie, phase III and IV trials) human subjects. Each of these

phases has a different purpose.

A phase | trial is the first step in testing a new treatment in humans. Data is collected on the
drug's pharmacokinetic profile, metabolism, and pharmacodynamic response (ie, how it
affects the body). Different treatment routes (eg, orally, intravenously) may also be
investigated. Human safety is assessed in terms of adverse effects and the maximum
tolerated dose (MTD). Gradually increasing doses are typically administered to find the
highest dose (ie, MTD) that does not cause unacceptable toxicity. Phase | trials usually

include only a small number of healthy subjects.

Note: Cancer-related phase | trials may involve subjects with cancer (rather than healthy
subjects) who have been unresponsive to other treatments.

(Choice A) Contrary to phase I, Il, Ill, and IV trials, which include human subjects, preclinical

studies do not involve human subjects.
