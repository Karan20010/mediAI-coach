Each of the 8 blood sample results is an independent event (ie, one patient's result has no
impact on another's) with a 0.95 (95%) probability of correctly testing negative and a 0.05 (5%)
probability of incorrectly testing positive. To calculate the chance of all 8 tests testing negative,
multiply the probability of each test returning a negative result:

0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 x 0.95 = 0.952

(Choices A and B) The value 0.05 x 8 is equivalent to adding the probability of a sample
testing positive 8 times, and 0.95 x 8 is equivalent to adding the probability of a sample testing
negative 8 times. However, the combined probability for a series of independent events is
calculated using multiplication, not addition. For instance, when flipping a coin twice the
probability of getting 2 heads in a row is not 0.5 + 0.5 = 0.5 x 2 = 1 (100%) but rather 0.5 x 0.5
= 0.25 (25%).

(Choice C) The probability of all 8 samples incorrectly testing positive is given by 0.05».

(Choices E and F) Overall, 2 outcomes are possible: either all 8 samples will return the
same test result or at least 1 sample will test differently. Because the total probability must
add up to 1 (100%) and the probability that all 8 samples will return negative is given by 0.95,

the probability of at least 1 sample testing positive is 1 - 0.95:. Conversely, the probability that
