Using this information, the number of FN can be calculated as follows (alternate method):
FN = (1 — Sensitivity) x (Number of patients with the disease) = (1 —- 0.75) x 200 = 50

Educational objective:
When undergoing diagnostic testing, patients with the disease can test positive (true positive,

TP) or negative (false negative, FN). The sensitivity of a test determines the proportion of
patients that are correctly classified:

TP = (Sensitivity) x (Number of patients with the disease)
FN = (1 — Sensitivity) x (Number of patients with the disease)
