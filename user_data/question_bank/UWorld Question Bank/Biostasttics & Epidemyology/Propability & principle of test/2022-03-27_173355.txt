A group of psychiatrists has noticed an unusual number of older individuals with depression in
the surrounding community. A decision is taken to conduct a cross-sectional study to estimate
the prevalence of depression in this specific population. Estimates for the prevalence of
depression (cases per 100 individuals) in the community are as follows:

Age group | Women | Men
60-69 9.1 8.4
70-79 11.9 | 10.4
80-89 13.5 | 12.4

90+ 13.3. | 12.1
Total 11.9 | 10.8

Suppose during an afternoon clinic, a psychiatrist sees a 65-year-old woman, a 72-year-old
man, and an 84-year-old woman from this community. Assuming no relation between the 3
patients, what is the probability that none of them has depression?
