before and after an intervention) and one in which 2 groups of individuals have been matched
based on certain attributes (eg, age, severity of disease). In this case, THI scores are
assessed twice for each patient (preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluations);
therefore, a paired t-test is used.

(Choice A) The analysis of variance (ANOVA) test compares the mean of 23 independent
groups, as in a study comparing serum ferritin concentrations (ie, quantitative variable) in
children (age 0-17), adults (age 18-59), and seniors (age 260).

(Choice B) The chi-square test evaluates the association between 2 categorical variables, as
in a study evaluating the association between sex (ie, "male" and "female") and myocardial
infarction (ie, presence or absence).

(Choice C) Acorrelation analysis uses the correlation coefficient to describe the linear
relationship between 2 quantitative variables, as in a study evaluating the linear relationship
between hours of sleep and irritability score.

(Choice D) Meta-analysis is a statistical technique used to combine and analyze data from
several studies to conduct an analysis with a greater statistical power than that of the
individual studies.
