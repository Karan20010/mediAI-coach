reject a false H,; in other words, power = (1 - 8). This study reported a 10% chance (ie, 0.10
probability) of concluding that there is no relationship (ie, no correlation) between the 2
variables under study when one truly exists: this is the probability of a type II error (8).
Therefore, the power of the test (ie, probability of rejecting a false H,: stating there is a

correlation when one truly exists) is 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.

One way to determine whether to reject H, is to calculate the p-value, the probability of
obtaining the observed result (or results more extreme) when H, is assumed to be true. The p-
value is also informally interpreted as the probability that the observed results are due to
chance (although this is not technically correct). In this case, researchers concluded that the
probability that results were due to chance is 0.03; therefore, the p-value = 0.03.

Educational objective:

The power of a test is the probability of making the correct decision of rejecting a false H, (ie,
determining there is a correlation when one truly exists). The p-value is the probability of
obtaining the observed result (or results more extreme) when H, is assumed to be true; it is

informally interpreted as the probability that the observed results are due to chance.
