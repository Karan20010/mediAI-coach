Important parameters of diagnostic tests include the following:
¢ True positives (TP) represent diseased individuals with positive test results.
¢ True negatives (TN) represent healthy individuals with negative test results.
¢ False positives (FP) represent healthy individuals with positive test results.

¢ False negatives (FN) represent diseased individuals with negative test results.

¢ Sensitivity (TP/ [TP + FN]) represents a test's ability to correctly identify diseased
individuals from among all individuals. A test with high sensitivity has a low FN rate
(important for screening purposes). With a highly sensitive test, most diseased patients
will have a positive test result (and a negative test result would help rule out the disease
[SnNOut)).

¢ Specificity (TN/ [TN + FP]) represents the ability of a test to exclude those without the
disease. A very specific test has a low FP rate (important for confirmatory tests). With a
highly specific test, most healthy patients will have a negative test result (and a positive
test result would help rule in the disease [SpPIn)).

The cutoff value of a quantitative diagnostic test determines whether a given result is
interpreted as positive or negative. Depending on the disease or condition being tested for,
sensitivity or specificity may be preferred and the cutoff value adjusted accordingly. A cutoff
