- A statistical hypothesis is an initial assumption (that may or may not be true) regarding
5 population parameters (eg, mean values in two different groups) or the relationship between
: variables within a population (eg, association between an exposure and a disease). The null
2 8 hypothesis (H,) is a statement of no difference or no association. The alternative hypothesis
a

(H,) is a statement of difference or association.

In this case, patients are initially identified based on their disease status (ie, cases: patients
with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] bacteremia, controls: patients without
MRSA bacteremia). The frequency of factors (ie, exposure to insertion of a central line or
urinary catheter, surgical site infection) is subsequently compared between cases and
controls. Therefore, this is a case-control study; the most appropriate measure of
association between an exposure and a disease in case-control studies is the odds ratio
(OR), which represents the odds of disease among exposed patients relative to nonexposed
patients.

The OR may be interpreted as follows:

Â¢ OR = 1.0 (null value) indicates that the odds of exposure among cases are the same as
the odds of exposure among controls; therefore, exposure is not associated with the

disease.
