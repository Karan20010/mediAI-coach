Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 180 / (180 + 20) = 180/200 = 0.90 (or 90%)

(Choice A) In this example, FP / (TN + FP) = 20/ (180 + 20) = 20/200 = 10%. This value is
called the false positive rate, which is equal to (1 — specificity). It represents the probability of

a false positive test result in a patient who in reality is free of disease.

(Choices B and D) Sensitivity (a test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the disease)
can be given by TP / (TP + FN), where TP is true positives and FN is false negatives. In this
example, sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 60/ (60 + 140) = 60/200 = 0.30 (or 30%). The false
negative rate (= 1 — sensitivity) is given by FN / (TP + FN) = 140 / (60 + 140) = 140/200 = 0.70
(or 70%). It is the probability of a false negative test result in a patient who in reality has the

disease.

(Choice C) From a total of 400 patients (= 60 + 140 + 20 + 180), there are 200 patients (= 60
+ 140) who have a urinary tract infection (UTI) based on the gold standard. The prevalence of
UTIs is therefore 200/400 = 0.50 (or 50%).

Educational objective:

The specificity of a test is its ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease.
Specificity should be high in confirmatory tests to decrease false positives.
