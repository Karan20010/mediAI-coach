in the study and randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the low-carbohydrate (40 g/d) or the
low-fat (<7% saturated fat) diet. At 12 months, a greater body weight change was reported in
the low-carbohydrate diet group compared to the low-fat diet group, with a mean difference in
body weight change of -3.5 kg (p = 0.01, predetermined significance level = 0.05). Which of

the following is the most accurate interpretation of the results of this study?

©) A. The observed mean difference in body weight change of —3.5 kg is not statistically
significant

©) B. The probability of observing a mean difference in body weight change of -3.5 kg is
0.01

©) C. There is a 1% chance of observing a mean difference in body weight change of at
least -3.5 kg when no difference between groups is assumed

©) D. There is a 1% chance that an adult on a low-carbohydrate diet will have a body
weight change of at least -3.5 kg at 12 months after starting the diet

|) E. There is a 1% chance that the mean difference in body weight change is biased in
