(Choices C and D) Sensitivity and specificity of a test are intrinsic characteristics of a test;
their values are fixed and do not vary with the pretest probability of a disease. An ideal
diagnostic test should be both highly sensitive and highly specific. In this case, fine-needle
aspiration has a high sensitivity and specificity; however, the NPV is a better parameter for
addressing the patient's question (ie, how likely is she to not have thyroid cancer given her
negative test result?); in this case her NPV might be low given her prior radiation exposure.

(Choice E) Validity represents the accuracy of the test (ie, the test measures what it is
supposed to measure). It does not depend on the pretest probability of the disease.

Educational objective:

Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability of not having a disease when the test result
is negative. The NPV will vary with the pretest probability of a disease. A patient with a high
probability of having a disease will have a low NPV with a negative test, but a patient with a
low probability of having a disease will have a high NPV with a negative test.
