To determine the NPV in this case, it helps to summarize the results of the efficacy study in a 2
x 2 table. The study evaluated 200 individuals in a population with a 50% prevalence of
dementia (ie, 100 patients had dementia while 100 did not). Knowing that specificity (ie, true
negatives/total disease negatives) and sensitivity (ie, true positives/total disease positives) are

80% and 90%, respectively, the following 2 x 2 table can be created:

The negative predictive value (NPV) of a diagnostic test is the probability that a patient truly

5 does not have the disease when the patient receives a negative test result. It can be

: calculated from study data as follows:

: NPV = number of true negatives / total number of negative tests
