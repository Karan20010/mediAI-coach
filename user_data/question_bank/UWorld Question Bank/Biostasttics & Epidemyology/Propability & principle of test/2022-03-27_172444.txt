Educational objective:
Specificity is the number of true negatives divided by the total number of subjects confirmed as
not having the disease.

True negatives = (Specificity) * (Number of patients confirmed without the disease)
False positives = (1 - Specificity) * (Number of patients confirmed without the disease)
