A new tumor marker is being investigated for its usefulness in diagnosing ovarian cancer. A

sample of 400 women is stratified into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of BRCA

mutations. Serum levels of the new marker are obtained in the 2 groups; in addition, both

groups of women undergo conventional screening to determine their disease status. The

curves on the top represent the distribution of the new serum marker in women with BRCA

mutations, and the curves on the bottom represent the distribution of the new serum marker in

women without the BRCA mutations.
