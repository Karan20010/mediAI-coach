Positive Negative

PPV =
Positive test result TP FP
=) Gia ae
NPV =
Negative test result FN TN
TN / (TN + FN)
Sensitivity = Specificity =
TP/(TP+FN) | TN/(TN + FP)

FN = false negative; FP = false positive; NPV = negative predictive value; PPV =

positive predictive value; TN = true negative; TP = true positive.

The specificity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease;
it is the number of true negatives (TN) divided by all those without the disease. Specificity
should be high in confirmatory tests to decrease the number of false positives (FP). Using a
generic 2x2 (contingency) table, specificity can be calculated from: TN / (TN + FP). In this
