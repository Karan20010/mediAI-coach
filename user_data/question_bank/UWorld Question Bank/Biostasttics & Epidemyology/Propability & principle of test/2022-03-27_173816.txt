The sensitivity of a test determines how well the test categorizes patients who have the
disease of interest. Tests with higher sensitivity have an increased probability of assigning a
positive test result to those patients who truly have the disease; these are considered true
positives (rightmost part of the curve). Conversely, patients who test negative even though
they have the disease are considered false negatives (leftmost part of the curve).

True positives (TP) and false negatives (FN) are complementary (ie, an increase in one
parameter is exactly offset by a decrease in the other, such that the total is always equal to the
number of confirmed patients). As such, the test sensitivity and number of patients with the
disease can be used to calculate the number of each:

TP = (Sensitivity) x (Number of patients with the disease)
FN = (1 — Sensitivity) x (Number of patients with the disease)

In this case, the sensitivity of the test is 75% and the total number of patients with confirmed

acute myocardial infarction is 200. Therefore, a test that is 75% sensitive will correctly classify
75% of the patients as positive (TP) and incorrectly classify 25% of the patients (1 -
Sensitivity) as negative (FN).

Using this information, the number of FN can be calculated as follows (alternate method):
