Predictive values are performance measures of diagnostic tests that are dependent on the
prevalence of disease in a population of interest. The positive predictive value (PPV) is the
probability that someone who tests positive actually has the disease. It is calculated by

dividing the number of true-positive results by the total number of positive results (ie, TP / [TP
+ FP]). The number of true-positive results depends on the sensitivity, and the number of
false-positive results depends on the specificity; the relative proportion of each is determined
by the prevalence of disease in the population.

Populations with a lower disease prevalence have fewer true-positive results and higher
numbers of false positives, so the PPV decreases. As disease prevalence increases, the
number of true positives also increases, while the number of false positives decreases,
resulting in a higher PPV. Similarly, the negative predictive value increases as the disease
prevalence decreases.

(Choices A and B) Positive and negative likelihood ratios indicate how a particular positive or
negative test result influences the pretest probability of having a disease. Likelihood ratios >1
indicate that the test result is associated with the presence of the disease; likelihood ratios <1
mean that the test result is associated with the absence of the disease. Because positive and
