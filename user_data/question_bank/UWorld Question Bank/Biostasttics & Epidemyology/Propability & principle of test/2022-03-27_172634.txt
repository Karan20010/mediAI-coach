The NPV can now be estimated as follows:
NPV = number of true negatives (d) / total number of negative tests (c + d)
NPV =d/(c +d) = 80/ (10 + 80) = 0.889 = ~ 89%

Unlike sensitivity and specificity, positive and negative predictive values vary based on the
prevalence of the disease. In fact, the NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a
disease (eg, NPV | as disease prevalence Â¢). For the NPV to be applicable to an individual
patient, that patient's pretest probability (eg, probability of having the disease before testing)
must be similar to the prevalence of disease in the population where the study was
conducted. The question says to assume that the patient's pretest probability is equivalent to
the disease prevalence in the study population, so the NPV calculated in the study is
generalizable to this patient.

Educational objective:

Negative predictive value (NPV) represents the probability of not having a disease given a
negative test result. NPV is inversely proportional to the prevalence of a disease. When a
patient has characteristics similar to the overall population (eg, age, sex, risk factor status), the
disease prevalence is a valid estimate of the pretest probability of disease.
