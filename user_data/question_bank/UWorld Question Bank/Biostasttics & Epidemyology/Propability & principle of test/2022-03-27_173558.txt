A research laboratory develops a new serologic test for detecting prostate cancer. The new
assay is compared to transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy to determine sensitivity
and specificity parameters. It is found that the test result is negative in 95% of patients who do
not have the disease. If the new assay is used on 8 blood samples taken from patients without
prostate cancer, what is the probability of all 8 test results coming back negative?
