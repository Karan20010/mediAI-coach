An 89-year-old man is brought to a geriatric clinic by family members who are concerned that

he is developing dementia due to recent worsening of his memory. The attending physician

uses a new cognitive test (test X) to help rule out the possibility of dementia. The patient's test

result is negative. A study evaluating the efficacy of test X in a sample of 200 individuals age

>85, in which the prevalence of dementia is 50%, has determined that the test has a specificity

of 80% and a sensitivity of 90%. Assuming that this patient's pretest probability of having

dementia is equivalent to the disease prevalence in the study population, what is the

probability that this patient truly does not have dementia?
