The positive predictive value (PPV) is defined as the proportion of individuals with positive
test results who actually have the disease. This concept can be understood in terms of
probability: given that a patient has a positive test result, what is the likelihood that he or she
actually has the disease? PPV depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of a test, but
also on the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. The more common the
disease in the population, the more likely it is that a patient with a positive test result actually
