The two-sample t test is commonly employed to determine if the means of 2 populations are
equal. Several statistical approaches can be used, but the basic numerical requirements
needed to perform this test are the 2 mean values, the sample variances (eg, standard
deviations), and the sample sizes. The t statistic is then calculated, from which the p value
can be determined. If p < 0.05, the null hypothesis (which assumes that there is no difference
between 2 groups) is rejected and the 2 means are assumed to be statistically different.

(Choice B) Linear regression is used to model the linear relationship between a dependent
variable and an independent variable. For example, linear regression could be used to
determine the relationship (described in terms of a trend line) between the number of
cigarettes smoked per day and the number of yearly hospitalizations in COPD patients.

(Choice C) The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength and direction of a linear
relationship between 2 variables. For example, a study may report a correlation coefficient
describing the association between estrogen levels and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal
women. It is different from linear regression in that a single number is reported describing the
strength and magnitude of the association.

(Choice D) The chi-square test is most appropriate for use with categorical data. It can be
