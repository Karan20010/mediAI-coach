Common performance measures for diagnostic tests

Parameter Definition Calculation

Sensitivit The probability of an individual testing Sensitivity = True positives / (true positives + false
y positive given the presence of disease negatives)

Specificity The probability of an individual testing Specificity = True negatives / (true negatives + false

negative given the absence of disease

positives)

Positive predictive value (PPV)

The probability that an individual who tests
positive actually has the disease

PPV = True positives / (true positives + false
positives)

Negative predictive value (NPV)

The probability that an individual who tests
negative actually does not have the disease

NPV = True negatives / (true negatives + false
negatives)

Positive likelihood ratio (LR+)

The probability of an individual with the
disease testing positive divided by the
probability of an individual without the
disease testing positive

LR+ = Sensitivity /
(1 - specificity)

Negative likelihood ratio (LR-)

The probability of an individual with the
disease testing negative divided by the
probability of an individual without the
disease testing negative

LR- = (1 - sensitivity) /
specificity
