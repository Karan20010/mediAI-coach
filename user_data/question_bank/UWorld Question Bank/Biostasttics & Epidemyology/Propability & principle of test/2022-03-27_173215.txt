4 A t-test compares the mean of 2 groups. It requires that a quantitative dependent variable
- (ie, outcome) be evaluated in 2 groups that are classified based upon a categorical
7 independent variable (ie, exposure).

. ou ¢ The quantitative dependent variable was the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) score.

¢ The categorical independent variable was the audiometric evaluation (with categories
"preoperative" and "postoperative").

A t-test will determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in mean THI scores
between the preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluations. A large, statistically
significant difference in mean scores indicates that labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation
is associated with changes in tinnitus (ie, the null hypothesis is rejected).

There are 2 types of t-tests: the independent samples t-test (used when 2 groups are
independent) and the paired t-test (used with 2 related groups with matched pairs). Matched
groups are formed when each observation in one group is paired with an observation from the
other group. Examples include a study in which individuals have been assessed twice (eg,
before and after an intervention) and one in which 2 groups of individuals have been matched
