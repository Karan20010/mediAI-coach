(Choices A and E) Sensitivity is a test's ability to correctly identify individuals with the
disease. Sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) = 130 / (130 + 50) = 130/180. Specificity is a test's
ability to correctly identify individuals without the disease. Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 760/
(760 + 60) = 760/820.

(Choice C) The total number of individuals who have tuberculosis (based on the gold
standard of positive sputum culture) is 180. The total number of individuals in this sample is
1000. Therefore, the prevalence of tuberculosis in this sample is 180/1000.

(Choice D) NPV = 760 / (760 + 50) = 760/810.

Educational objective:

The positive predictive value (PPV) of a test answers the question: If the test result is positive,
what is the probability that a patient has the disease? PPV = true positives / (true positives +
false positives).
