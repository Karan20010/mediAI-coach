sensitivity or specificity may be preferred and the cutoff value adjusted accordingly. A cutoff
value just outside the overlapping region of the curves can maximize the sensitivity or
specificity at 100% by correctly classifying all diseased or healthy individuals, respectively.

In the above example, changing the cutoff point to a lower value (shift to the left) would cause
more patients with the disease to test positive (TP, |FN), increasing the sensitivity of the
test. However, as a consequence, more patients without the disease would also test positive
(TN, TFP), resulting in decreased specificity.

(Choices A, D, and E) Raising the cutoff value (shift to the right) would cause fewer
individuals with the disease to have a positive test result ({TP, TFN), so sensitivity would
decrease. Fewer individuals without the disease would also test positive (tTN, |FP), so
specificity would increase.

(Choice B) Positive predictive value (PPV = TP / [TP + FP]) represents the probability that a
patient with a positive test result actually has the disease. In this case, the lower cutoff value
would increase both TP and FP; how this affects the PPV depends on disease prevalence,
which is not provided. In a population with very low disease prevalence, the number of FP

would be expected to increase proportionately more than the number of TP, which would lower
the PPV.
