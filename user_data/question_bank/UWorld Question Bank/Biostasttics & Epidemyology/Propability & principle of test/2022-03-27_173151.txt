hearing, vertigo, and tinnitus. A random sample of medical charts is selected from a cohort of
patients who had undergone labyrinthectomy with cochlear implantation in the same ear for
intractable vertigo and hearing loss and who had documentation of both preoperative and
postoperative audiometric evaluations. Tinnitus is quantified using the Tinnitus Handicap

Inventory (THI) before and after the interventions. The THI score ranges from 0 to 100, with
higher values indicating greater tinnitus severity. Which of the following statistical tests is most

appropriate for comparing preoperative and postoperative THI scores?

© A. Analysis of variance
