=erent Probability of having | Probability of NOT having
depression depression
65-year-old woman 0.091 1 = 0211
72-year-old man 0.104 1=0.104
84-year-old woman 0.135 1-0.135

The age- and gender-specific prevalence of depression in the community is a good estimator
of the probability that a corresponding individual from community has the disease. Because
each of the 3 patients is unrelated to the others, each of the diagnoses is an independent
event (ie, a patient's diagnosis has no impact on another's). When events are independent of
each other, the probability that all the events occur is calculated by multiplying together the
probability of each individual event.

In this case, to calculate the probability that none of the 3 patients has depression, multiply the
probability of each complementary event (ie, the probability of not having depression):

(1 - 0.091) x (1 - 0.104) x (1 - 0.135) = 0.909 x 0.896 x 0.865 = 0.705
(Choices A and E) The probability that all 3 patients have depression can be calculated by
