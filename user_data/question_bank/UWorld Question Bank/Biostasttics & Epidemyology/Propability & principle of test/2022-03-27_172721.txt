citrullinated proteins. Two test populations with a differing prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis
are selected. The researchers plan to assess the test's performance in the 2 populations by

comparing a number of diagnostic test parameters. Which of the following performance
measures is most likely to be different between the 2 test populations?

A. Negative likelihood ratio (1%)
B. Positive likelihood ratio (8%)
