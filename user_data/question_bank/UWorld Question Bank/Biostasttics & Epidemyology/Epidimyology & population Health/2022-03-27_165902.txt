Prevalence is the actual number of existing cases (old and new) of disease, either at a
particular point in time (point prevalence), or during a period of time (period prevalence).
These measures are calculated as follows:

Point prevalence = (existing cases in a population) / (total number of people in the
population)
Period prevalence = (existing cases in a population in a period) / (total number of
people in the population)

Estimates of prevalence of disease (ie, point or period prevalence) in a population are

affected by population dynamics:

¢ The emigration of healthy individuals will increase disease prevalence estimates by
decreasing the population size (denominator).

¢ The immigration of cases will increase disease prevalence estimates by increasing the
number of existing cases (numerator).

¢ The emigration of cases will decrease disease prevalence estimates by decreasing the
number of existing cases (numerator).
