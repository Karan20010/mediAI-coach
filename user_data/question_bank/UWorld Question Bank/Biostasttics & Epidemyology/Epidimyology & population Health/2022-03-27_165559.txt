Incidence and prevalence are important concepts for evaluating the impact of disease on a

population. Incidence corresponds to the number of new cases of a disease diagnosed in a

population at risk over a given period. Prevalence refers to the total number of diseased

individuals in the population at a particular point; it is dependent on incidence and the

average duration of the disease (ie, time from diagnosis to cure or death):

Prevalence = (Incidence) x (Duration of disease)

A simplified diagram compares incidence and prevalence to adding new drops (incident cases)
to asink collecting water (prevalent cases).

The above graph shows that the incidence of type II diabetes mellitus has been constant for
the last 30 years (Choice F), but that prevalence is rising. Because this is a steady-state
population with little migration, a constant incidence rate should result in a nearly stable
disease prevalence, unless there is some additional factor affecting the duration of the
condition. Factors that prolong disease duration can increase disease prevalence even
when the incidence is unchanged because diseased individuals live longer on average. In this
case, improved quality of care likely led to a lower mortality rate in diabetics over time,
resulting in a higher prevalence of the disease in the population (Choice B).

Choice A) A decreased hospitalization rate would indicate reduced morbidity (ie, burden of
