OR = (odds of endometriosis in cases) / (odds of endometriosis in controls) = (a/c) /
(b/d) = 0.3/0.2 = 1.5

The estimated OR = 1.5 is >1 (ie, the null value for the OR); this indicates that a history of
endometriosis acts as a risk factor for SLE.

This example calculated the OR of exposure (ie, odds of exposure among cases relative to
controls). The OR is sometimes described as the odds of disease among exposed individuals
relative to nonexposed individuals, given by (a/b) / (c/d). Both OR definitions are
mathematically equivalent and reduce to OR = (ad) / (bc).

Educational objective:

The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association calculated as: OR = (odds of exposure in
cases) / (odds of exposure in controls). For a contingency table in the standard format: OR =
(ad) / (be).
