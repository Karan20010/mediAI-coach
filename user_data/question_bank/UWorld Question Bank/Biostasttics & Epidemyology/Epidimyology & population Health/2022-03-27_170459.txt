Prevalence refers to the proportion of diseased individuals in a particular at-risk
population, often measured in the following ways:

¢ Period prevalence refers to the number of disease cases in a period (eg, from July 1 to
July 31) divided by the number of people in the at-risk population (ie, prevalent cases at
the beginning of a period plus any incident cases during the period).
¢ Point prevalence refers to the number of disease cases that are active at a specific
point in time (eg, July 31) divided by the number of people in the at-risk population.
In this example, a study determined the number of cases of catheter-associated urinary tract
infection (CAUTI) among patients in the intensive care unit during the month of July. There
were 9 cases of CAUTI in July; a tenth case developed after July 31. Four of the 9 patients
recovered before July 31; therefore, the number of cases of CAUTI still active on July 31 was
5.
(Choice A) Only 1 patient had developed CAUTI before July 1; this represents the number of
point-prevalent cases on July 1.

(Choice B) Four patients with CAUTI recovered during the month of July.
