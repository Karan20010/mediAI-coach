within 5 years of hypertension diagnosis in the treatment group is:

ARR & (RiSKeoni — RiSKreamen) = (0.10 - 0.03) = 0.07

and the NNT is:
NNT = 1/ARR = 1/0.07 = 14.3 = 15

NNTs are always rounded up to the nearest whole number, so approximately 15 patients
need to be treated with medication X + standard therapy to prevent 1 additional case of
proteinuria within 5 years of hypertension diagnosis.

(Choices A and C) 3 and 10 represent the number of patients in the treatment group and in
the control group, respectively, who developed proteinuria within 5 years of diagnosis.

(Choice B) 7 represents the ARR expressed as a percentage, calculated as: ARR = 100 =
(RiSKeonso: — RiSKreamen) = 100(0.10 - 0.03) = 7.

(Choice E) 70 represents the relative risk reduction (RRR) expressed as a percentage. The
RRR describes the relative decrease in the risk of an adverse event in the treatment group
compared to a control group; it is calculated as: RRR = 100 * [(RiSKesnia — RiSKrestmen) / RiSKeonra) =
100[(0.10 - 0.03) / 0.10] = 70.
