(ie, graph has a narrower bottom). These populations are shrinking, and their pyramids
are characteristic of very advanced countries with a high level of literacy, easy access to
birth control measures, and exceptional health and medical resources.

In this question, the population pyramid has a broad bottom, indicating a high birth rate, anda
narrow top, indicating a higher mortality rate that results in a short life expectancy (Choices B
and C). Populations with high birth rates are populations that are young and growing
(Choices D and E). Therefore, the population pyramid is characteristic of many developing
countries.

Educational objective:

There are three types of population pyramids: expansive (ie, young and growing population;
high birth and mortality rates), stationary (ie, stable population; declining birth rates and low
mortality rates), and constrictive (ie, shrinking population; significantly low birth and mortality

rates).
