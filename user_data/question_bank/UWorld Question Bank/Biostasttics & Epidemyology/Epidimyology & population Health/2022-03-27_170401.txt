The positive predictive value (PPV) of a diagnostic test is the probability (ie, likelihood) that
an individual truly has the disease given a positive test. PPV is equal to the number of
individuals who have the disease and who test positive (ie, true positives [TP]) divided by the
total number of individuals with a positive test result (TP + false positives [FP]):

PPV =TP/ (TP + FP)
To determine PPV in this example, it helps to construct a 2 = 2 table with the expected data for
this population according to the properties of the diagnostic test. In this example, the
pediatrician examined 1,000 children in a population with a 10% prevalence of asthma (ie, 100
children have asthma, 900 do not). The sensitivity, which is equal to TP / (TP + false negatives
[FN]), and the specificity, which is equal to true negatives (TN) / (TN + FP), are 95% and 80%
respectively. Therefore, the number of TP is 95 (ie, 100 x 0.95), the number of FN is 5 (ie,
100 - 95), the number of TN is 720 (ie, 900 x 0.80), and the number of FP is 180 (ie, 900 -
720).

The PPV can be calculated as follows:
PPV = TP/ (TP + FP) = 95/ (95 + 180)

Predictive values depend on the prevalence of the disease in the study population; as the
