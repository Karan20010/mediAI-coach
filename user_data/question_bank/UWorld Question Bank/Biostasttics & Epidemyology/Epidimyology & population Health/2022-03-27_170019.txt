Sensitivity = Specificity =
TP/(TP+FN) | TN/(TN + FP)

FN = false negative; FP = false positive; NPV = negative predictive value; PPV =

positive predictive value; TN = true negative; TP = true positive.

The negative predictive value (NPV) of a diagnostic test is the probability (ie, likelihood) that
an individual truly does not have the disease given a negative test. It is equal to the number
of individuals who do not have the disease and who have a negative test result (ie, true
negatives [TN]) divided by the total number of individuals with a negative test result (TN + false

negatives [FN]). Therefore, NPV is calculated as: Activate Windows
