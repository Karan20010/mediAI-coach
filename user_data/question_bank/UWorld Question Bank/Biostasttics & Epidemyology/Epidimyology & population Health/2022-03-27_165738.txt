Misclassification bias results from an incorrect categorization of subjects regarding their
exposure status, outcome status, or both.

¢ Nondifferential misclassification reflects equal misclassification rates between groups,
making them look more similar than they are and pushing the association toward the null
value (eg, odds ratio = 1) (ie, bias toward null hypothesis)

¢ Differential misclassification reflects unequal misclassification rates between groups and
can push the association toward or away from the null value

Case-control studies that rely on questionnaires or interviews to determine exposure
status are particularly susceptible to misclassification bias in the form of recall bias.
Subjects who have experienced an adverse event such as head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) are more likely to recall previous potential exposures (eg, pesticide
exposure) than subjects who have not experienced an adverse event.

In this case-control study, cases (ie, HNSCCs) may have a better recall of past pesticide
exposures than controls (ie, no HNSCCs); this may cause differential misclassification bias
when assessing exposure status.

(Choice A) Confounding bias occurs when an extraneous variable distorts the relationship
