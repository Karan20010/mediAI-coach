(Choice A). Compared to new HBV cases, there were approximately just as many new HAV
cases in 1987 and more new HAV cases in 1989. However, the total number of HAV or HBV
cases in the population cannot be calculated without additional information. In fact, there were
likely more total cases (ie, higher prevalence) of HBV as it can progress to a chronic form
(Choices B and C).

A simplified diagram compares incidence and prevalence to adding new drops (incident cases)
into a water-containing sink (prevalent cases).

(Choice E) HAV incidence per 100,000 population was similar in 1982 and 1998. However,
the overall US population, and consequently the number of new HAV cases, was different.
Assuming HAV incidence was ~10 new cases/100,000 population for both years, then, in 1982
(US population ~230 million):

New HAV cases in 1982 = 10/100,000 x 230,000,000 = 23,000

Also, in 1998 (US population ~275 million at least):
New HAV cases in 1998 = 10/100,000 x 275,000,000 = 27,500

Even with different incidences, it is unlikely that exactly the same number of new HAV
