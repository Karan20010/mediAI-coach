The food item responsible for an outbreak often (though not always) has the largest attack rate
and the largest difference in attack rates between those who consumed the item and those
who did not. In this example, as calculated above, the difference in attack rate between those
who had potato salad and those who did not was: 34% — 11% = 23%. As seen in the exhibit,
the differences in attack rates were smaller for hamburgers (7%) and hotdogs (16%). It is
possible that potato salad is the source of the outbreak.

Educational objective:

The attack rate is the ratio of the number of people who contract an illness divided by the
number of people who are at risk of contracting that illness.
