Educational objective:

Prevalence equals the incidence rate multiplied by the average disease duration. Changing
disease prevalence in a steady-state population with a constant incidence rate means that
there is an additional factor affecting the duration of the condition. A factor that prolongs
disease duration (eg, improved quality of care) will increase disease prevalence, as affected

patients survive longer.
