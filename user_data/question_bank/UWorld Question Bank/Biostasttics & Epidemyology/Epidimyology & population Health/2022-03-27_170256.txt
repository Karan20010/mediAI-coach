A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new medication X added to standard
antihypertensive therapy compared to standard antihypertensive therapy alone for preventing
the development of proteinuria in patients recently diagnosed with essential hypertension.
Five years after diagnosis, 97 of 100 patients on the medication X + standard antihypertensive
therapy regimen have not developed proteinuria, and 90 of 100 patients on a standard

antihypertensive therapy regimen have not developed proteinuria. According to these results,
which of the following represents the approximate number of patients with essential
hypertension who need to be treated with medication X to prevent an additional patient from
developing proteinuria within 5 years?
