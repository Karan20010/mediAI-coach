According to the World Health Organization, health promotion is "the process of enabling
people to increase control over their health and its determinants, and thereby improve their
health". Examples include improving dietary habits (limiting fat intake, consuming fruits and
vegetables), exercising regularly, abstaining from smoking, and losing weight if needed.
Health promotion typically falls under primary prevention, which is preventing a disease
process from getting established.

Secondary prevention refers to interrupting the disease process before symptoms develop.
An example is case finding, which is looking for disease that may be present but
asymptomatic in patients receiving medical care (eg, age- and gender-appropriate screening)
(Choice A). Community screening is an analogous intervention at the community level (eg,
measuring hypertension at a state fair). Tertiary prevention corresponds to treating an
established condition with the goal of minimizing its progression or complications (Choice G).

(Choice B) Cognitive-behavioral therapy is a standardized psychotherapeutic modality
focusing on identifying and addressing persistent maladaptive thought patterns. It is used as
monotherapy or in combination with medication to treat a variety of mental illnesses (eg,
anxiety, mood, personality, somatic symptom, eating disorders).
