(Choice C) Interventions such as imposing taxes on cigarettes or soda or mandating smoke-
free establishments can be implemented at the community level to improve the health of the
public.

(Choice E) Health risk assessments rely on questionnaires that use demographic, medical,
lifestyle, and family history information to calculate a patient's "risk age". A patient whose risk
age is greater than chronological age has a higher risk of death than the average individual of
that chronological age.

(Choice F) The "stages of change" model (originally developed to help patients quit smoking)
assesses an individual's readiness to change a problem behavior. The precontemplative
stage is when a patient does not believe there is a problem (eg, smoking) and is unwilling to
contemplate a change (eg, quitting). The subsequent stages are contemplation, preparation,
action, and maintenance.
