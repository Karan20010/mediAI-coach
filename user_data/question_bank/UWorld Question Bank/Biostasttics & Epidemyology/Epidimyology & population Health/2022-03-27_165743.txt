(Choice A) Confounding bias occurs when an extraneous variable distorts the relationship
between an exposure and a disease, such as when the association between pesticide
(exposure) and HNSCC (disease) varies by age (confounder). In this study, cases and
controls were pair-matched by age and sex; for example, a 35-year-old woman with HNSCC
(case) was matched with a 35-year-old woman without HNSCC (control). This matching
removes differences in age and sex between groups in the analysis, making confounding by
age (and sex) very unlikely.

(Choice B) Healthy worker bias occurs in cohort studies of occupational exposures in an
employed population when the comparison group is the general population. Compared to the
employed population (ie, healthy enough to work), the general population can include
unhealthy subjects (ie, not healthy enough to work); therefore, the mortality rate in the general
population may be higher than in an employed population, and comparing mortality rates
between these 2 cohorts is biased.

(Choice D) Nonresponse bias occurs when respondents differ from nonrespondents in such
meaningful ways that threaten the generalizability of study results. It most often occurs when
data is collected by mailed surveys or questionnaires; in this study, patients were directly
interviewed, making nonresponse bias less likely.
