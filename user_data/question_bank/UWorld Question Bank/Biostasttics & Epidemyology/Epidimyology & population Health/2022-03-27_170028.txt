NPV = TN/(TN + FN)
In this example, 120 individuals are TN and 5 individuals are FN; therefore, the total number of
individuals with a negative test result (TN + FN) is 125 (ie, 120 + 5), and the test's NPV is
calculated as follows:

NPV = TN/(TN + FN) = 120/ (120 + 5) = 120 / 125 = 0.96
Positive and negative predictive values depend on the prevalence of the disease in the study
population. For example, it is more likely that individuals who test positive truly have the

disease and less likely that individuals who test negative do not have the disease in a high-

prevalence population compared to a low-prevalence population.

(Choice A) 0.10 is the false negative rate (FNR). FNR is equal to FN / (FN + TP) and
describes the proportion of the individuals who really have the disease for which the test result
is negative. It is also known as the miss rate.

(Choice B) 0.20 is the false positive rate (FPR). FPR is equal to FP / (FP + TN) and
describes the proportion of the individuals who really do not have the disease for which the
test result is positive. It is also known as the fall-out rate.

(Choice C) 0.60 is the overall proportion of TN in the entire study: TN / (TP + TN + FP + FN).
