Therefore, approximately 50 patients would need to be treated with cariprazine to cause
harm to 1 person who otherwise would not have been harmed. The lower the NNH, the more
risk of harm; an NNH of 1 means that every patient treated is harmed.

(Choices B, C, and D) The absolute risk reduction (ARR) is the difference in risk of an
unfavorable event (eg, treatment nonresponse) between the cariprazine and placebo groups:
ARR = (Ratt pisceoo — Rate carrazine). In this case, the rate of no response in the cariprazine group is
100% - 46% = 54% and in the placebo group is 100% - 32% = 68%, so ARR = 0.68 - 0.54 =
0.14 (ie, 14%). The relative risk reduction (RRR) is (Ratepisccv. — Rate ceroraine ) / Ratesiscer, SO RRR
= (0.68 — 0.54) / 0.68 = 0.21 (ie, 21%). The number needed to treat (NNT) to avoid 1
additional negative event (ie, no treatment response) compared to placebo is the inverse of the
absolute risk reduction (ARR): NNT = 1/ARR=1/0.14=8.

Educational objective:

The number needed to harm (NNH) is the number of people who must be exposed to a
treatment to cause harm to 1 person who otherwise would not have been harmed. To
calculate NNH, the absolute risk increase (ARI) between the treatment and control groups
must be known: NNH = 1/ARI.
