Educational objective:

Incident cases represent new cases diagnosed in a given period of time. Prevalent cases are
the total number of cases (both old and new) at a particular point in time. Any treatment that
prolongs survival but does not cure the disease will increase prevalence due to an increase in

the number of afflicted (but still living) individuals over time.
