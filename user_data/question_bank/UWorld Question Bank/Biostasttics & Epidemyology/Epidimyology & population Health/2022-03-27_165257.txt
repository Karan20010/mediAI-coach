Researchers at an academic trauma center conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing 2
surgical techniques (Technique A and Technique B) for repairing a mandible fracture. They
examined rates of infectious complications and rates of malocclusion (defined as misaligned
dental arches on visual examination when the jaw is closed). A total of 100 patients were
enrolled in the study. Outcome assessments of each patient were conducted at 2 weeks, 4
weeks, and 8 weeks after surgery. Results showed that the relative rate of infection with
Technique A compared with Technique B was 0.86 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.57-1.28;
the 2 techniques had similar malocclusion rates at 8 weeks after surgery. Which of the
following statements most accurately represents the comparison of Technique A and
Technique B in a clinical care setting?

VY _ A. Neither surgery technique is superior (75%)
B. Technique A is superior to Technique B (12%)
C. Technique B is superior to Technique A (8%)

D. The techniques should not be used in a clinical care setting (3%)
