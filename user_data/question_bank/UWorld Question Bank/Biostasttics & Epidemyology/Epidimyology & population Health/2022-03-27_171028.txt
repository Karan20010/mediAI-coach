Explanation

Case-fatality rate (CFR) is a measure of the severity of a disease or condition. It is defined
as the proportion of reported cases of a specific disease or condition (eg, methicillin-resistant
S aureus, [MRSA)) that are fatal within the population affected by the disease or condition
over a specific time. The CFR can be calculated as the number of fatal cases of disease or
condition divided by the total number of people with the disease or condition.
In this scenario, 40 fatal and 70 nonfatal cases of MRSA infection are reported. Therefore, the
CFR is:

CFR = 40 / (40 + 70) = 40/110
(Choice A) This choice describes the ratio of fatal to nonfatal MRSA infection cases (40/70).
(Choices C and D) These choices describe the proportion of MRSA deaths out of all surgical
infection deaths (40/75 = 53/100).
(Choice E) This choice describes the proportion of nonfatal cases of MRSA infection out of all

nonfatal surgical infection cases (70/220).
