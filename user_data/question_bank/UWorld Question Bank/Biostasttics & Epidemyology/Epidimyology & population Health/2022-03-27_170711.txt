A randomized controlled trial is conducted to compare transcatheter aortic valve replacement
(TAVR), using a self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve bioprosthesis, with surgical aortic
valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis. The objective is to determine the
difference in risk of death from any cause. Seven hundred forty-seven patients with severe

aortic stenosis who are at increased surgical risk are recruited and randomly assigned to

groups for treatment with TAVR or surgical valve replacement. Follow-up assessments are
performed at discharge and at 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. The 1-year follow-up results

are as follows:

Death from any cause
Yes No Total
TAVR 57 | 333 390
Surgical valve replacement] 68 289 Soi
Total 125 | 622 747

Which of the following best represents the absolute risk reduction for death from any cause in
patients treated with TAVR compared to those treated with surgical replacement?
