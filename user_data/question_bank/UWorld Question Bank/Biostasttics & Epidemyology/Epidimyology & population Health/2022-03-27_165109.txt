The number of people who must be exposed to a treatment to cause harm to 1 person who
otherwise would not have been harmed is known as the number needed to harm (NNH). It is
calculated in a manner similar to the number needed to treat (NNT) but using the absolute
risk increase (ARI) instead of the absolute risk reduction:

NNH = (1 /ARI)

ARI is the difference in the rate (risk) of the adverse event (AE) between the treatment
group (eg, cariprazine) and the control group (eg, placebo):

ARI = (Rate AE carorazne — Rate AE piaceoo)

In this study, the rate of any AE in the treatment group (ie, cariprazine) is 0.07 (ie, 7%) and in
the control (ie, placebo) group is 0.05 (5%). Therefore, the ARI in adverse events of
cariprazine versus placebo is:

ARI = (Rate AE caicrane ~ Rate AE scx.) = 0.07 - 0.05 = 0.02 (or 2%) (Choice A)
Consequently, the NNH is:
NNH = (1 /ARI) = 1/ 0.02 = 50
