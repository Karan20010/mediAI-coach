A study is conducted to assess whether quantitative measurement of heat shock protein 90

alpha (Hsp90q) in plasma can improve diagnostic accuracy and help monitor treatment

response in liver cancer patients. A total of 300 individuals (100 liver cancer patients and 200

healthy controls) participate in the study. Analyses reveal that 90 of the liver cancer patients

have an abnormally high plasma Hsp90q level and that 12 of the healthy controls have an

abnormally high plasma Hsp90a level. An abnormally high plasma Hsp90ad level indicates a

positive test for liver cancer. Which of the following values best represents the specificity of
this test?
