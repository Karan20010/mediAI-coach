RR = 1) is statistically significant (at that confidence level).

In this study, the RR for infection among those assigned to surgery Technique A compared to
those assigned to surgery Technique B is 0.86 with a 95% Cl of 0.57-1.28. An RR = 0.86
indicates that exposure to surgery Technique A decreases the risk of infection. However,
because the Cl includes the null value (ie, RR = 1), the decrease in risk is not statistically
significant. Therefore, neither surgery technique is superior at reducing infection (Choices B
and C).

(Choice D) The study results show that the surgery techniques have similar rates of infectious
complications and malocclusion. Assuming these rates are acceptable and there are no other
major complications, there is no reason to determine the surgical techniques should not be
used in a clinical care setting, but further information may be useful.
