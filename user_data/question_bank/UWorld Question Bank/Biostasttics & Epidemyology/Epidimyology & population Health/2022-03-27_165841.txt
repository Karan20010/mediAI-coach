effectiveness of different treatments within a single study or between similar studies (eg,
similar patient characteristics, control groups, duration of follow-up). In this example, a single
study is testing 2 treatments (ie, Drugs A and B) against placebo (ie, control group) to prevent
death (ie, negative effect) in recently diagnosed children randomized to treatment groups with
a similar follow-up (ie, 2-week survival):

¢ Drug A versus placebo: ARR = 0.05, so NNT = 1/ 0.05 = 20
¢ Drug B versus placebo: ARR = 0.20, so NNT = 1/0.20=5

Drug A requires treating more children to prevent 1 additional death compared to Drug B
(20 vs 5). Ahigher NNT indicates a lower effectiveness; therefore, Drug A is less effective
compared to Drug B (Choices A, B, C, and E).

Educational objective:

The number needed to treat (NNT) is the number of patients who need to receive a treatment
to prevent 1 additional negative event. NNT is the inverse of the absolute risk reduction. The
lower the NNT, the more effective the treatment because fewer patients need be treated to
prevent 1 additional negative event.
