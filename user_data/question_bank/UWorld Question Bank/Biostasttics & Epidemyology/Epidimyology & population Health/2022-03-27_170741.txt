NNT is the number of patients who need to be treated with a treatment (eg, TAVR) to prevent 1

additional negative event (eg, death from any cause) when compared to a control group (eg,
surgical replacement). A lower NNT indicates a more effective treatment because fewer
patients need to be treated to prevent 1 additional negative outcome. In this example, the
approximate NNT with TAVR to prevent 1 additional death from any cause is:

NNT = 1 / [(68/357) — (57/390)] = 22.562 (Choice E)

(Choice B) [(68/357) — (57/390)] / (68/357) = 0.233 represents the relative risk reduction
(RRR) for death from any cause in the TAVR group compared to the surgical replacement
group: RRR = (RiSKoonie — RiSKreaimen) / RiSKeono- Unlike ARR, which quantifies the absolute
difference in risk between the groups, RRR describes the difference in risk between the groups
as a proportion of baseline risk (ie, risk in the control group).

(Choices C and D) Switching the numerator and denominator changes the interpretation of
the relative risk (RR, the ratio of the probability of an event occuring in one group compared to
the other group). In this example, (57/390) / (68/357) represents the RR of death from any
cause in the TAVR group compared to the surgical replacement group; (68/357) / (57/390)
represents the RR of death from any cause in the surgical replacement group compared to the
TAVR group.
