In this question, the population pyramid has a narrow bottom, which represents a low birth
rate, and a wide top, which represents a low mortality rate (Choices A and B). The
percentage of people in each age cohort increases with age, with the greatest proportion of
people in the age 70+ cohort (Choice E). This means that the population has a long life
expectancy—a characteristic of old populations (Choice D).

Because the percentage of people in the age 0-9 cohort (about 10% for both men and women)
is lower than the percentage of people in the age 70+ cohort (about 20% for both men and
women), the younger cohorts are not able to replace the older cohorts as they die off,

leading to a reduction in the population (ie, population shrinks). This is a classic example of

a constrictive pyramid.

Educational objective:

There are three types of population pyramids: expansive (ie, young and growing population;
high birth and mortality rates), stationary (ie, stable population; declining birth rates and low
mortality rates), and constrictive (ie, shrinking population; significantly low birth and mortality

rates).
