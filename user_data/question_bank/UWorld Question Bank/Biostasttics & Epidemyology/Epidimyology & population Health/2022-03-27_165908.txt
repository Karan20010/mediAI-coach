¢ The emigration of cases will decrease disease prevalence estimates by decreasing the
number of existing cases (numerator).

¢ The immigration of healthy individuals will decrease disease prevalence estimates by
increasing the population size (denominator).

In this example, the prevalence of a chronic disease has been constant for the last 15 years;
therefore, new cases have been balanced by cures or deaths of prevalent cases. If a large
number of healthy individuals emigrate from the population, then the number of cases
(numerator) would remain the same, but the population size would decrease
(denominator). Therefore, estimates of disease prevalence would increase.

Educational objective:

Prevalence is the actual number of existing cases (old and new) of disease, either ata
particular point in time (point prevalence), or during a period of time (period prevalence).
Estimates of disease prevalence in a population are affected by population dynamics.
