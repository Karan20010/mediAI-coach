Predictive values are performance measures of diagnostic tests that are dependent on the

prevalence of disease in a population of interest.

¢ Negative predictive value (NPV) is the probability (ie, likelinood) that an individual truly
does not have the disease given a negative test result. NPV is equal to the number of
individuals who do not have the disease and who test negative (true negatives [TN])
divided by all those with a negative test result (TN + false negatives [FN]): NPV = TN/(TN
+ FN).

¢ Positive predictive value (PPV) is the probability (ie, likelinood) that an individual truly
does have the disease given a positive test result. PPV is equal to the number of
individuals who have the disease and who test positive (true positives [TP]) divided by all
those with a positive test result (TP + false positives [FP]): PPV = TP / (TP + FP).

Disease prevalence affects NPV by changing the number of TN and FN tests. It affects PPV
by changing the number of TP and FP tests (Choice A):

¢ Populations with exceptionally low disease prevalence (eg, prevalence close to 0%) have
almost all TN (ie, more TN) with almost no TP (ie, fewer TP), and most positive tests would
be FP (ie, more FP) with almost no FN (ie, fewer FN). In this scenario, NPV is close to

100%, and PPV is close to 0%. This explains why, with decreasing prevalence, NPV
