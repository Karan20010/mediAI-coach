100%, and PPV is close to 0%. This explains why, with decreasing prevalence, NPV
increases (more TN, fewer FN) and PPV decreases (fewer TP, more FP).

¢ Populations with exceptionally high disease prevalence (eg, prevalence close to 100%)
have almost all TP (ie, more TP) with almost no TN (ie, fewer TN), and most negative tests
would be FN (ie, more FN) with almost no FP (ie, fewer FP). In this scenario, NPV is close
to 0%, and PPV is close to 100%. This explains why, with increasing prevalence, NPV
decreases (fewer TN, more FN) and PPV increases (more TP, fewer FP).

(Choices B, C, and E) In this example, population 1 has a lower prevalence (15%) of
dementia in women age 275 compared to population 2 (30%). Therefore, NPV in population 1
> NPV population 2, and PPV in population 1 < PPV population 2.

Educational objective:
Predictive values change depending on the prevalence of disease in a study population. As

. disease prevalence increases, the positive predictive value increases, and the negative

predictive value decreases.
