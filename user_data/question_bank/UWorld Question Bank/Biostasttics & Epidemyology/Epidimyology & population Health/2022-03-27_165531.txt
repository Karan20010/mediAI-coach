(Choice C) The rate of increase of a disease (ie, the increase in disease prevalence) is the
number of new cases per year minus the number of deaths (or cures) attributable to the
disease per year, divided by the total population. This yields (7,000 - 1,000) / 4,000,000.
(Choice E) The Cl is calculated by taking into consideration the population at risk at the

beginning of the period under study. In this case, the denominator must be reduced by the
number of cases reported at the beginning of the year 2016 (ie, 4,000,000 - 20,000 =
3,980,000).

(Choice F) The prevalence of disease at the end of 2016 takes into consideration the
prevalent cases at the beginning of the year, the incident cases throughout the year, and all
the deaths reported by the end of the year. In this case, the prevalence at the closing of 2016
is: ([20,000 + 7,000] — 1,000) / (4,000,000 — [40,000 + 1,000}).

(Choice G) The mortality rate is the number of deaths per year divided by the total
population. This yields 41,000 / 4,000,000.

Educational objective:
The cumulative incidence of a disease is the number of new cases of a disease over a specific
period divided by the total population at risk at the beginning of the study (ie, the proportion of

at-risk individuals who contract the disease over the specified period).
