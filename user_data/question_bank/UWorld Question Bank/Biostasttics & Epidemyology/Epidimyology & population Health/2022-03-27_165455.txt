In this example, 12 out of 200 healthy controls had an abnormally high plasma heat shock
protein 90 alpha (Hsp90q) level (ie, tested positive); therefore, FP = 12 and TN = 188 (ie, 200
- 12). Therefore, the specificity of the test is as follows:

Specificity = TN / (TN + FP) = 188 / (188 + 12) = 188 / 200 = 0.94 (or 94%)

(Choice A) In this example, 6% is the false positive rate (FPR): FPR = FP/(TN + FP) =12/
(188 + 12) = 12 / 200 = 0.06 (or 6%). FPR is the probability of a positive test in a patient
without the disease (ie, FP); it is also the complement to specificity (ie, FPR = 1 —- specificity =
1 - 0.94 = 0.06).

(Choices B and D) The sensitivity of a test refers to its ability to correctly identify individuals
with the disease. It is calculated as the number of individuals who have the disease and who
test positive (true positives [TP]) divided by the total number of individuals with the disease (TP
+ false negatives [FN]): sensitivity = TP / (TP + FN). In this example, 90 of 100 liver cancer

patients had an abnormally high plasma Hsp90a level (ie, tested positive); therefore, TP = 90
and FN = 10 (ie, 100 - 90). Accordingly, the sensitivity of the test is 90 / (90 + 10) = 90 / 100 =
0.90 (or 90%). Sensitivity is related to the false negative rate (FNR): FNR = 1 — sensitivity.
FNR is the probability of a negative test result in a patient with the disease (ie, FN): FNR = FN
/ (TP + FN) = 10/ (10 + 90) = 10/ 100 = 0.10 (or 10%).
