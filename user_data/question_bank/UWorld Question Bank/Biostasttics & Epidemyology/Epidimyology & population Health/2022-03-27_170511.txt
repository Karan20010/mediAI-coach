Researchers conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine whether prophylactic
administration of tranexamic acid (TXA) in addition to prophylactic oxytocin in women
undergoing vaginal delivery has an effect on the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH),
defined as blood loss 2500 mL. Study participants are women in labor who have a planned
vaginal delivery of a live singleton at 235 weeks gestation. They are randomly assigned to
receive 1 g TXAor placebo intravenously in addition to prophylactic oxytocin after delivery.
The relative risk of PPH among women receiving TXA in addition to oxytocin is 0.80 (95%
confidence interval of 0.66-0.96). Which of the following is the most appropriate conclusion
about the effect of TXA in addition to prophylactic oxytocin after delivery on the risk of PPH?

() A. Adding TXA is associated with a 20% increase in the risk of PPH

/

©) B. Receiving TXA in addition to prophylactic oxytocin decreases the risk of PPH by
80%

() C. The risk of PPH is reduced by 20% when TXA is added to prophylactic oxytocin

)

©) D. The risk of developing PPH in the TXA treatment group is 0.8%

©) E. TXA prophylaxis has no significant effect on the risk of PPH
