: The odds of endometriosis in women with SLE and women without SLE are:
. ¢ Odds of endometriosis in cases: a/c = 240/800 = 0.3
+ 20 e Odds of endometriosis in controls: b/d = 210/1,050 = 0.2

0 Therefore, the OR of endometriosis in women with SLE compared to women without SLE is:
23
os OR = (odds of endometriosis in cases) / (odds of endometriosis in controls) = (a/c) /
— (b/d) = 0.3/0.2 = 1.5
= The estimated OR = 1.5 is >1 (ie, the null value for the OR); this indicates that a history of
