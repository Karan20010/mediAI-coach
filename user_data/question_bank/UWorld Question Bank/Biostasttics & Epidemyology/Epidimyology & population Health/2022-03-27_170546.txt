: A test is used to diagnose dementia in a population of 1,000 women age 275. The test has a
6 sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. The test is then used as a diagnostic tool in 2 other
z populations of women of the same age: population 1 has a prevalence of dementia of 15%,
9 and population 2 has a prevalence of dementia of 30%. Which of the following best describes
s how the negative predictive values (NPV) and the positive predictive values (PPV) from
12 populations 1 and 2 relate to each other?
13
: A. NPV and PPV do not change as prevalence changes (7%)
26 B. NPV in population 1 < NPV population 2; PPV in population 1 < PPV population 2
‘ (7%)
= C. NPV in population 1 < NPV population 2; PPV in population 1 > PPV population 2
21 (7%)

Y% — D.NPVin population 1 > NPV population 2; PPV in population 1 < PPV population 2

+ 24 (76%)

25
26 E. NPV in population 1 > NPV population 2; PPV in population 1 > PPV population 2
is (1%)
