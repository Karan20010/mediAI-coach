The absolute risk reduction (ARR) describes the efficacy of a treatment (eg, Drug A)
compared to a control group (eg, placebo); it is the difference in the risk (or rate) of a negative
event (eg, death) between treatment and control groups:

ARR = (RisKenio ~ RiSKyesinen)

ARR expressed as a percentage describes the number of negative events (eg, deaths)
prevented in 100 patients. For example, an ARR of 0.05 indicates that 5 of 100 patients
treated with a treatment (eg, Drug A) would be prevented from developing a negative event.
Therefore, to prevent 1 patient from developing a negative event, it would be necessary to
treat 100 /5 = 1/0.05 = 20 patients. This is the number needed to treat (NNT).

NNT is the number of patients who need to be treated with a treatment (eg, Drug A) to prevent

1 additional negative event (eg, death) compared to a control group (eg, placebo); NNT is
the inverse of the ARR:

NNT =1/ARR

A lower NNT indicates more effective treatments because fewer patients would need to be
treated to prevent 1 additional negative outcome. NNTs can be used to compare the
effectiveness of different treatments within a single study or between similar studies (eg,
