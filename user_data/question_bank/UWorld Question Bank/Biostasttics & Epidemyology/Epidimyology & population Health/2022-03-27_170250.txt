OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls) = (a/c) / (b/d) = 0.50 /
1.10 = 0.45

The OR is <1: this indicates that a high intake of probiotic yogurt during pregnancy has a
protective effect against GDM.

This example calculated the OR of exposure (ie, odds of exposure among cases relative to
controls). The OR is sometimes described as the odds of disease among exposed individuals
relative to nonexposed individuals, given by (a/b) / (c/d). Both OR definitions are
mathematically equivalent and reduce to OR = (ad) / (bc).

Educational objective:

The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association calculated as: OR = (odds of exposure in
cases) / (odds of exposure in controls). For a correctly formatted contingency table: OR = (ad)
/ (bc).
