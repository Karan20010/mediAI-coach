‘ The number of TP and FN can be more quickly calculated using the following equations:
5
6 TP = (Sensitivity) x (Number of patients who truly have the disease)
7
8 FN = (1 — Sensitivity) x (Number of patients who truly have the disease)
= (Choices B, C, and E) 90 is the number of false positives (FP), 160 is the number of TP, and
i 210 is the number of true negatives (TN) found in the study.
12

. : study.
Educational objective:

False negatives (FN) refer to individuals who test negative for a disease but who truly have the
disease. The number of FN can be calculated using the number of individuals who truly have
the disease and the sensitivity of the test, or by using the formula: FN = (1 - Sensitivity) x
(Number of patients who truly have the disease).
