The odds of an event are related to the probability P of that event, with odds = P/(1-P). For
example, the probability of rolling a die and getting a 1 is 1/6, but the odds of rolling a 1 is 1/5.
The odds ratio (OR) is a measure of association used in case-control studies to compare the
odds of exposure in cases (ie, individuals with disease) relative to controls (ie, individuals
without disease):

OR = (odds of exposure in cases) / (odds of exposure in controls)

A shortcut to calculate the OR when a contingency table has a standard format (ie, exposure
of interest in the first row of exposure status and cases in the first column of disease status) is
the following:

OR = (a/c) / (b/d)
In this study, the disease of interest is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), so cases are
women with SLE, and controls are women without SLE. The exposure of interest is a history
of endometriosis. Given that 240 of 1,040 women with SLE had a history of endometriosis,
1,040 — 240 = 800 of women with SLE had no history of endometriosis. Given that 210 of
1,260 without SLE had a history of endometriosis, 1,260 - 210 = 1,050 of women without SLE
had no history of endometriosis. Based on these data, the standard contingency table is as
