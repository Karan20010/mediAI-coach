- (Choices A and B) Atopic dermatitis can cause a pruritic rash affecting the extremities, but it
5 usually presents in childhood and most patients have a history of other atopic disorders (eg,
: allergic rhinitis, asthma). The lesions in contact dermatitis are also pruritic but occur in
& localized areas corresponding to the specific exposure (eg, waist with nickel belt buckle
= exposure). Biopsy in these conditions would show spongiosis (epidermal edema) in the acute
= phase and acanthosis (diffuse epidermal hyperplasia) in chronic disease.
(Choice C) Erythema nodosum is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction that presents with

tender inflammatory nodules in the subcutaneous fat, primarily on the shins. The
characteristic histopathologic finding is septal panniculitis in the subcutaneous tissues, with a
variable (lymphocytes, neutrophils, macrophages) infiltrate.

(Choice E) Psoriasis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by cytokine-
driven keratinocyte hyperproliferation leading to acanthosis with clubbed rete ridges,
parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in stratum corneum), and thinned stratum granulosum. It
also demonstrates the Koebner phenomenon but usually presents with chronic erythematous
plaques with silvery scales on the extensor surfaces of the knees and elbows, scalp, or neck.
