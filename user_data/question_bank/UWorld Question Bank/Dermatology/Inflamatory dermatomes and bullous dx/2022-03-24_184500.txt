Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder that presents with scaly,
erythematous plaques, typically on the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees. In
predisposed individuals, disruption of the epithelial barrier leads to activation of antigen-
presenting dendritic cells and subsequently to a self-reinforcing inflammatory cascade
characterized by recruitment and activation of T helper cells and proliferation of
keratinocytes.

Histopathologically, psoriasis is characterized by:

¢ Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the stratum corneum) and confluent parakeratosis
(retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum) produces the characteristic silvery scale on
gross examination

¢ Epidermal hyperplasia (acanthosis) with elongated rete ridges correspond to the typical
erythematous plaques

¢ Neutrophilic foci in the stratum corneum and epidermis, which may coalesce to form
microabscesses (Munro microabscesses)

In addition, the epidermal cell layer superficial to the dermal papillae may be thinned and
contain dilated blood vessels, which leads to pinpoint bleeding when the scale is removed
from the plaque (Auspitz sign).
