(Choice A) Dermatitis herpetiformis is caused by autoantibodies against tissue
transglutaminase. It presents with small, intensely pruritic vesicles on the elbows, knees, and
buttocks and is typically seen in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (ie, celiac disease).

(Choice C) Atopic dermatitis is a multifactorial disorder but is commonly seen in association
with loss of function mutations in filaggrin and other epidermal barrier proteins. Infants have
red, crusted lesions at the extensor surfaces and face, whereas older children and adults have
pruritic patches and lichenification at flexural areas.

(Choice D) A delayed T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction is responsible for allergic
contact dermatitis (eg, poison ivy/rhus dermatitis), which presents acutely with pruritic vesicles
at sites of contact.
