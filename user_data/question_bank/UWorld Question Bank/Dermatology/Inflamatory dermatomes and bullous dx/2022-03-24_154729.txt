A 25-year-old woman comes to the office due to a 4-week history of a pruritic skin rash. The
patient has no chronic medical conditions and takes no medication. Vital signs are normal.
On examination, there are pink papules distributed symmetrically over the anterior surfaces of
the shins and ankles. Shave biopsy reveals prominent hyperkeratosis along with a thickened
granular layer. In addition, there is a bandlike infiltrate of mononuclear cells (predominantly

lymphocytes) in the subjacent superficial dermis that involves the overlying epidermis. The
rete ridges have a sharpened, sawtooth appearance. The basal layer of the epidermis is
degenerated, with scattered colloid bodies. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
