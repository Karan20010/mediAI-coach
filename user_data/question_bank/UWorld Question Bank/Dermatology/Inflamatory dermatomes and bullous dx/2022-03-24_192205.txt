Educational objective:

Urticaria is a transient hypersensitivity disorder characterized by pruritic erythematous plaques
that arise suddenly and resolve over hours. They are most often caused by IgE-mediated
degranulation of mast cells, leading to increased permeability of the microvasculature with

edema of the superficial dermis.
