(Choice A) Disseminated herpes simplex infection is seen primarily in immunocompromised
patients and presents with diffuse vesicles on an erythematous base. EM does not represent
disseminated infection, but is a systemic immune response to a localized infection.

(Choice C) Primary HIV infection can present with a macular or maculopapular rash
associated with fever. The rash is usually well circumscribed and involves the trunk, face, and
palms and soles. However, this patient's rash appears more typical of EM.

(Choice D) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is characterized by rapid onset of erythematous
macules with necrosis and skin sloughing. Systemic signs (eg, fever, hypotension) are
common. Stevens-Johnson syndrome may also cause target lesions, but it is usually
associated with medications (eg, sulfonamides, allopurinol, phenytoin).

(Choice E) Varicella typically presents with fever and a vesicular eruption that can affect
multiple areas, including the face, trunk, abdomen, and extremities. This patient's rash does
not have the typical vesicular pattern seen in varicella.
