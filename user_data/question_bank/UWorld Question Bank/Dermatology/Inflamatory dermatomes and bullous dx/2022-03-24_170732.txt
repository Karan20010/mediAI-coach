Atopic dermatitis (AD), or eczema, is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder common in
children. The disease typically occurs at age <5, with many patients developing symptoms in
infancy. AD typically presents as erythematous papules and plaques involving the face, scalp,
trunk, and extensor surfaces. The diaper area is usually spared. In older children and adults,
it often manifests as lichenification in a flexural distribution (eg, neck, wrists, antecubital and
popliteal fossae). Eczema has a chronic course marked by exacerbations and remissions, and
its severity tends to lessen with age. Intense pruritus is a hallmark of AD.

AD can be associated with mutations affecting epidermal barrier proteins such as filaggrin,
resulting in impaired skin barrier function. This increases immunologic exposure to
environmental allergens and microbial antigens, leading to immune hypersensitivity.
Affected patients usually have high serum IgE levels and peripheral eosinophilia. Children
with AD often have a family history of atopy and are at risk of developing other atopic
diseases, such as allergic rhinitis and asthma (allergic triad).
