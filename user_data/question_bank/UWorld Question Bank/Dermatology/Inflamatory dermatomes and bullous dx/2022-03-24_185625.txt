Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune blistering disease that typically occurs in patients >60.
It presents with tense bullae with rare mucosal involvement. Autoantibodies against
hemidesmosomes create subepidermal cleavage. Immunofluorescence shows linear
deposition of IgG and/or C3 along the basement membrane.
