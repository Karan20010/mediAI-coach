Educational objective:

Allergic contact dermatitis is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Initially, Langerhans
cells travel to regional lymph nodes and present haptens to naive T cells, leading to clonal
expansion. On reexposure to the hapten, sensitized T cells cause tissue destruction that
manifests as pruritic erythema, vesicles, and/or bullae 2-3 days after exposure.
