Educational objective:

Acute allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), caused by a type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reaction
to an antigen on the skin surface, typically presents with pruritic, erythematous,
papulovesicular, weeping lesions. Microscopically, acute ACD is characterized by spongiosis
(ie, accumulation of fluid between keratinocytes in the epidermis).
