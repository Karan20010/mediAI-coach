This patient has scaly, erythematous plaques consistent with psoriasis. Psoriasis is most
common in areas exposed to pressure or friction, such as the extensor surfaces of the elbows
and knees, and minor trauma (eg, skin friction while installing tile floors) can often precipitate
the formation of lesions (ie, Koebner phenomenon).

In predisposed individuals, disruption of the epithelial barrier leads to activation of antigen-
presenting dendritic cells and subsequently to a self-reinforcing inflammatory cascade
characterized by recruitment and activation of T-helper cells and excessive proliferation of
keratinocytes.

Histologically, this results in epidermal hyperplasia (ie, acanthosis), often with elongated and
clubbed rete ridges, corresponding to the typical erythematous plaques. There is
parakeratosis (ie, retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum), which produces the
characteristic silvery scales, as well as hypogranulosis (ie, decreased thickness of the granular
layer).

The epidermis superficial to the dermal papillae (ie, suprapapillary plate) is thin, and there are
dilated capillaries in the dermal papillae, which results in pinpoint bleeding upon scale
removal (ie, Auspitz sign). Clusters of neutrophils in the stratum corneum (ie, Munro
microabscesses) and spinosum are also characteristic features.
