This patient's atopic dermatitis has been successfully treated with a topical corticosteroid,
leading to suppression of the typical inflammatory features (eg, pruritis, papules, vesicles,
scales). However, chronic daily use of topical corticosteroids can cause cutaneous atrophy
due to the inhibition of epidermal keratinocyte proliferation and fibroblast function.

Fibroblasts synthesize dermal collagens 1 and 3 as well as hyaluronic acid. When these
components are diminished in the extracellular matrix of the dermis, indentations, striae,
tightening, and thinning of the skin result, making dermal capillaries more visible. In addition,
corticosteroids induce nitric oxide release, leading to capillary dilation (ie, telangiectasia).
Corticosteroids can also cause degradation and extrusion of follicular epithelium, resulting in
corticosteroid-induced acne.

High-potency topical corticosteroids can cause adverse effects within 2-3 weeks of daily
usage, with less potent corticosteroids taking longer to cause similar effects. Areas with thin
skin (eg, flexural surfaces, intertriginous areas, face, genitalia) are more susceptible.
Recovery can be expected within weeks to months after cessation of therapy.
