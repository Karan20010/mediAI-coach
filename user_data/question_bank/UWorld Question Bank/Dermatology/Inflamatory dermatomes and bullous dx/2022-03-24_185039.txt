This patient with acute pruritus following administration of morphine most likely has
medication-induced IgE-independent mast cell activation. A number of medications, including
opioids, radiocontrast agents, and some antibiotics (eg, vancomycin), can induce mast cell
degranulation by activation of protein kinase A and PI3 kinase. This results in release of
several mediators, including histamine, bradykinin, heparin, and a number of enzymes and
chemotactic factors. Common symptoms include diffuse itching and pain, bronchospasm, and
localized swelling (urticaria).
