Educational objective:

Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune bullous disease characterized by autoantibodies
directed against desmosomal proteins (eg, desmogleins). It presents with painful, flaccid
bullae and erosions affecting the skin and mucosal membranes. The bullae spread laterally
with pressure, and new blisters may form with gentle rubbing.
