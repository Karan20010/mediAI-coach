(Choices A and E) In type | (immediate) hypersensitivity reactions, initial allergen exposure
leads to Th2 cellâ€”induced, B-cell heavy-chain isotype switching and production of IgE, which
subsequently binds to mast cells. This is accomplished in part by the binding of CD40 on B
cells to CD40 ligand on T cells. On reexposure, allergens bind to IgE on mast cells and trigger
immediate release of vasoactive peptides, resulting in urticaria (and anaphylaxis if severe).
This inflammatory response is rapid (ie, minutes), unlike this patient's delayed (48-hr)
response.

(Choice B) Bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris are caused by autoantibodies
against hemidesmosomes and desmosomes on keratinocytes, respectively. This causes
epidermal/dermal separation and acantholysis, respectively, manifesting as bullae. These
conditions are not hypersensitive reactions and cannot be elicited by patch testing.

(Choice C) Immune complex deposition in small cutaneous vessels causes cutaneous small
vessel vasculitis (CSVV). Medications that function as haptens (eg, phenytoin, sulfonamides)
can cause the condition. Because of the extravasation of red blood cells due to vessel wall
inflammation, CSVV presents with nonblanchable purpura and petechiae, not vesicles.
