Educational objective:

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome occurs in infants and children due to the production of
exfoliative exotoxins by Staphylococcus aureus. The toxins cleave desmoglein in
desmosomes, leading to widespread epidermal blistering and shedding, especially with gentle
pressure (ie, Nikolsky sign). Mucous membranes are spared.
