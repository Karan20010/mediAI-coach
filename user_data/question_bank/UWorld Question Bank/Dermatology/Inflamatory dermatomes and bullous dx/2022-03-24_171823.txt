Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is characterized by erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles,
and bullae that appear symmetrically on the extensor surfaces (eg, elbows, knees), upper
back, and buttocks. Herpetiformis refers to the resemblance of the clustered vesicles to those
of herpes simplex. DH is characterized histologically by microabscesses containing fibrin and
neutrophils at the dermal papillae tips. The overlying basal cells become vacuolated, and
coalescing blisters form at the tips of the involved papillae. Immunofluorescent imaging shows
deposition of IgA at the dermoepidermal junction.
