(Choice A) Acantholysis is the loss of cohesion between keratinocytes in the epidermis. It is
a characteristic finding in the pemphigus family of disorders.

(Choice B) Acanthosis is a diffuse increase in thickness of the stratum spinosum (prickle cell
layer) between the granular cell layer and the basal layer of the epidermis. Common
conditions displaying acanthosis include psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, and acanthosis
nigricans.

(Choice D) Dyskeratosis describes the abnormal, premature keratinization of individual
keratinocytes. Dyskeratotic cells are strongly eosinophilic and may have a small, basophilic
nuclear remnant. Dyskeratosis can be found in diseases such as squamous cell carcinoma.

(Choice E) Spongiosis is intercellular epidermal edema that histologically appears as an
increase in the width of spaces between cells. Spongiosis is often associated with spongiotic
dermatitis, which encompasses a number of conditions (eg, eczematous dermatitis).
