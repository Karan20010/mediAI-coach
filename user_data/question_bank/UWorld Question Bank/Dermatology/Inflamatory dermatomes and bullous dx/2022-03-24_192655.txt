This patient has chronic, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with a thick scale consistent
with plaque psoriasis. Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disorder characterized by
hyperkeratosis (overgrowth of the stratum corneum) and epidermal hyperplasia. It has a
strong genetic predisposition and is often seen in patients with a family history of the disorder;
other risk factors include smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, and obesity.

Psoriasis has multiple variants (eg, guttate, pustular); however, up to 75% of cases are due to

chronic plaque psoriasis. Plaques are well-defined and erythematous and may appear raised
above the surrounding skin. They are typically covered in a coarse silver scale, which, when

removed, results in pinpoint bleeding (Auspitz sign) of the underlying dilated capillaries.

Plaques usually form in locations subject to trauma or friction (K6bner phenomenon); the
extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees are most classic, but the dorsal surface of the
hands, as in this patient, is also common. Other typical locations include the scalp, back, and
gluteal cleft. They are often mildly pruritic but may be asymptomatic.
