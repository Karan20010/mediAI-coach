had several episodes of itchy, erythematous, vesicular eruptions on her hands over the past
several months. She works at a hair salon and is often exposed to hair dye and other beauty
products. The patient has no other medical conditions and takes no medications. She
undergoes patch testing, during which several allergens found in common cosmetic products
are mounted on nonocclusive tape strips applied to her upper back. Skin findings developed
after 2 days of application and are shown in the exhibit. Which of the following processes

most likely occurred in this patient to enable the development of the observed skin reaction?

A. B-cell binding with helper T cells via CD40 and CD40 ligand (28%)

B. Formation of autoantibodies against keratinocyte cell surface antigens (3%)
