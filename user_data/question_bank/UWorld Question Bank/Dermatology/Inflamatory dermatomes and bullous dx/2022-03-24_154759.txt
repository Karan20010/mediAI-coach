This patient has a pruritic rash consistent with lichen planus (LP), an immunologically
mediated skin disorder primarily affecting middle-aged adults. The skin lesions typically occur
symmetrically on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can also involve the nails,
oral mucous membranes, and genitalia. The characteristic skin lesions are described by the 5
Ps: pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques and can form along lines of minor
trauma (Koebner phenomenon). Chronic lesions often show white, lacy markings known as
Wickham striae.

Although the etiology of LP is unknown, it is characterized by a (CD8+) T cell-mediated
response to the cells along the junction of the dermis and epidermis, resulting in the following
characteristic histologic findings:

¢ Chronic hyperkeratosis (thickening of stratum corneum)

¢ Lymphocytic infiltrates at the dermoepidermal junction (interface dermatitis)
¢ Scattered eosinophilic, colloid (Civatte) bodies (apoptotic keratinocytes)

¢ Hypergranulosis (thickening of stratum granulosum)

¢ Sawtooth rete ridges
