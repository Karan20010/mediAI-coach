Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by erythematous pruritic papules, vesicles, and bullae
that appear symmetrically on extensor surfaces. It is strongly associated with celiac disease, a
disorder characterized histologically by small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytosis, crypt
hyperplasia, and villous atrophy.
