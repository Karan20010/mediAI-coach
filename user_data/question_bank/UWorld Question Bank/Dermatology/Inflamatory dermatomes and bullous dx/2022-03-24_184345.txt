Lichen planus presents with pruritic, purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques that can
affect the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles, along with the nails, oral mucous
membranes, and genitalia. Histologic findings include hyperkeratosis (thickening of stratum
corneum), lymphocytic infiltrates at the dermoepidermal junction, hypergranulosis (prominent
granular layer), sawtooth rete ridges, and scattered eosinophilic colloid bodies.
