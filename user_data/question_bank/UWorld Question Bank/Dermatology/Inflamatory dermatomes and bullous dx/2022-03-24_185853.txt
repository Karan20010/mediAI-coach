Educational objective:
Bullous impetigo is a superficial infection by Staphylococcus aureus that is most common in

young children. It is characterized by a blistering skin rash with tan- to honey-colored crusts.
The blistering in bullous impetigo is caused by exfoliative toxin A, which targets desmoglein 1

in epidermal cellular junctions and causes a loss of cell adhesion.
