This child has a blistering skin rash with tan- to honey-colored crusts, consistent with
bullous impetigo (BI). Bl is a superficial infection by Staphylococcus aureus that is most
common in young children. It is spread by direct contact, with the greatest incidence in warm,
humid, crowded environments. Nonbullous impetigo is a similar syndrome with pustules and
crusting but without significant blistering. Either form may occur in healthy skin (primary
impetigo) or broken/inflamed skin (secondary impetigo).

The blistering in BI is caused by production of exfoliative toxin A, a serine protease that
targets desmoglein 1 in the superficial epidermis, by some strains of S aureus. Desmoglein is
a cadherin component of desmosomes in epidermal cellular junctions; disruption by
exfoliative toxin A causes a loss of cell adhesion and leads to formation of flaccid bullae.
Exfoliative toxin Ais also responsible for staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, which
presents with generalized erythema and flaccid bullae in flexural areas.
