Erythema multiforme is a target-shaped, inflammatory skin lesion that typically arises in the
setting of infection, particularly with herpes simplex virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It is
caused by the deposition of infectious antigens in keratinocytes, leading to a strong cell-
mediated (eg, cytotoxic T-cell) immune response.
