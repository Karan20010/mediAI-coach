This patient has chronic allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), presenting with localized itching
and lichenification (ie, skin thickening). Nickel is a common trigger and typically causes
symptoms at the wrists (eg, watches), earlobes (eg, earrings), or umbilicus (eg, belt buckles).
Corrosion of metal alloys by electrolytes in sweat releases soluble metal ions that trigger a
hypersensitivity reaction. ACD is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction occurring
in 2 phases:

1. Sensitization: Cutaneous Langerhans cells take up haptens (ie, allergens) and present
them to naive CD4- and CD8- T cells in regional lymph nodes, resulting in clonal expansion

of hapten-sensitive T cells. This phase takes 10-14 days and does not result in cutaneous
lesions.

. Elicitation: On reexposure, sensitized T cells are recruited to the dermis. There, they
release cytokines (eg, interferon gamma) that recruit additional inflammatory cells (eg,
macrophages, mast cells, eosinophils), resulting in erythema and pruritus. Dermal edema,
caused by leaky dermal vessels, seeps into the epidermal intercellular spaces
(spongiosis), pulling apart intercellular attachments and sometimes resulting in
intraepidermal vesicles. With persistent exposure, the lesions become thickened and less
vesicular; histopathology shows epidermal hyperplasia.
