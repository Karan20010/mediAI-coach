Lichen planus is an immune-mediated condition that presents with pruritic, pink papules and
plaques, often with lacy, scaly, white markings (Wickham striae). The lesions typically occur
on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can also involve the nails, oral mucous
membranes, and genitalia.
