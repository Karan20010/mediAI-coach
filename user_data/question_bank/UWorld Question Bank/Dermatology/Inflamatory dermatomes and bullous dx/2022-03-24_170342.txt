This patient's fever and desquamating rash are most consistent with staphylococcal scalded
skin syndrome (SSSS), an infection caused by strains of exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus
aureus.

Exfoliative exotoxins act as proteases that cleave desmoglein in desmosomes, which are
junctions that adhere epidermal cells together. Skin damage occurs as the exotoxins spread,
causing separation of keratinocytes and superficial epidermal blistering. Gentle pressure
causes detachment and shedding of the outer layer of skin (ie, Nikolsky sign). The rash,
although diffusely erythematous and painful ("scalded"), is most prominent in the skin folds
(eg, neck, axillae, groin). Perioral involvement (eg, erythema, crusting) is common,

but the mucous membranes are spared.

SSSS is most common in infants and young children, and skin findings are often preceded
or accompanied by fever, irritability, malaise, and poor feeding. Treatment includes
antistaphylococcal antibiotics (eg, nafcillin, oxacillin).
