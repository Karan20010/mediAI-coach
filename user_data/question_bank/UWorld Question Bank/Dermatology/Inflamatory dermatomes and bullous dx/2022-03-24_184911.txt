Educational objective:

Psoriasis is histologically characterized by diffuse epidermal hyperplasia with elongated and
clubbed rete ridges (corresponding to the typical erythematous plaques), confluent
parakeratosis (producing the characteristic silvery scales seen on examination), and dilated
capillaries in the dermal papillae (pinpoint bleeding).
