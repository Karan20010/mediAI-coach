Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune blistering disease characterized by serous fluidâ€”
filled, tense bullae on normal or erythematous skin. The most common sites of involvement
include the inner thighs and flexor aspects of the forearms, axillae, groin, and lower abdomen.
Elderly individuals are most commonly affected.

BP is caused by antibodies against hemidesmosomes along the basement membrane of the
dermal-epidermal junction. These autoantibodies result in a destructive inflammatory
cascade that causes the entire epidermis to separate from the dermis, forming subepidermal,
nonacantholytic blisters. Immunofluorescence shows IgG and/or C3 deposits in a linear
pattern along the basement membrane.
