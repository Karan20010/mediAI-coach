(Choice A) Chronic atopic dermatitis can produce plaques characterized by hyperkeratosis
and acanthosis, often with a lymphocytic or eosinophilic infiltrate. However, adults most
commonly develop lesions on flexural surfaces (eg, anterior elbows), and most patients have a
history of other atopic disorders (eg, asthma, allergic rhinitis) beginning in childhood.

(Choice B) Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with erythematous, pruritic papules, vesicles,
and bullae symmetrically on the elbows, knees, upper back, and buttocks. It is strongly
associated with celiac disease, and histopathology shows microabscesses at the dermal
papillary tips, which coalesce to form subepidermal blisters.

(Choice C) Erythema nodosum is characterized by painful, red nodules on the shins and
often represents an inflammatory response to medications (eg, oral contraceptives), infections,
inflammatory bowel disease, or sarcoidosis. Histopathology is variable but typically shows a
septal panniculitis with a mixed cellular infiltrate.

(Choice E) Urticaria ("hives") is a transient dermatologic disorder that is caused by antigen-
induced degranulation of focal mast cells through IgE antibody sensitization. This
degranulation causes microvasculature hyperpermeability and the formation of wheals that
typically surface and resolve within hours.
