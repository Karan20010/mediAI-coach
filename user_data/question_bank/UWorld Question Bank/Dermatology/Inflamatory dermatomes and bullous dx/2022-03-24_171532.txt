(Choice B) Mast cells are primarily responsible for immediate (type |) hypersensitivity
reactions. On reexposure, allergens bind to allergen-specific IgEs on mast cells, causing
immediate degranulation and release of vasoactive peptides (eg, histamine), resulting in
urticaria and, when severe, anaphylaxis. Onset is rapid (minutes), unlike this patient's delayed
(48-hr) response. Furthermore, individual wheals of urticaria resolve within 24 hours, rather
than days.

(Choice C) Neutrophils phagocytose bacteria and fungi and kill them by generating reactive
oxygen species (NADPH oxidase) and hypochlorous acid (myeloperoxidase). Although
neutrophils play a role in defense against cutaneous infections (eg, cellulitis, which is painful
rather than pruritic), this patient's rash is more consistent with contact dermatitis.

(Choice D) Immunoglobulins produced by plasma cells are responsible for type |! and II!
hypersensitivity reactions. ACD does not involve plasma cells or antibodies.

(Choice E) Regulatory T cells are CD4- lymphocytes that play an inhibitory role in the immune
response. They secrete cytokines (eg, interleukin-10) that inhibit macrophage function and
antagonize proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon gamma). This anti-inflammatory effect is
important in suppressing autoimmune diseases.
