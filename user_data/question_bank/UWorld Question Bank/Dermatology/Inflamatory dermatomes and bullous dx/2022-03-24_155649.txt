Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of inherited disorders caused by mutations involving
intraepidermal and dermoepidermal adhesion complexes in the basement membrane zone. It
is characterized by epithelial fragility (eg, bullae, erosions, ulcers) triggered by minor trauma.
Light microscopy of skin biopsy typically shows intraepidermal cleavage, although the plane of
cleavage can vary based on subtype.

The most common form of EB, EB simplex, is caused by mutations in keratin genes that
impair the assembly of keratin into filaments. It presents early in life with friction-induced
blisters at the palms and soles and other exposed areas. Lesions typically heal with no
residual scarring, although patients may have chronic thickening of the skin of the feet. Infants
with EB simplex may develop oral blisters with bottle-feeding.
