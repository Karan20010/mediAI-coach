8 characteristic of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (forms tense acral bullae) and cicatricial
° pemphigoid (causes chronic conjunctivitis and scarring).

i (Choice B) No known cutaneous diseases result from connexin autoimmunity, but connexin
12
13 defects do underlie some specific forms of palmoplantar keratoderma, which causes epidermal

+ 16 (Choice D) Autoantibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins cause bullous pemphigoid, in
= which the bullae are usually tense and remain intact as the entire epidermis separates from
to the dermis (no intraepithelial cleavage). In addition, mucosal involvement is less common and
* Nikolsky sign is usually negative.
, (Choice E) Autoantibodies against tissue transglutaminase result in celiac disease and
24 dermatitis herpetiformis, an autoimmune cutaneous eruption associated with gluten sensitivity.
= The eruption is characterized by grouped (herpetiform) erythematous papulovesicles that are

intensely pruritic, not painful; oral mucosal involvement is rare.
