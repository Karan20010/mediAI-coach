This patient has lichen planus (LP), an immune-mediated condition that typically presents with
pruritic, pink papules and plaques. LP lesions often have lacy, scaly, white markings
(Wickham striae) and can form at sites of minor trauma (K6bner phenomenon). The skin
lesions typically occur symmetrically on the flexural surfaces of the wrists and ankles but can
also involve the nails, oral mucous membranes, and genitalia.

The pathologic process in LP is characterized by a (CD8-) T cell-mediated response against
cells along the dermal-epidermal junction. Although the etiology is unknown, the risk may be
increased in patients with hepatitis C and those taking certain medications (eg, ACE inhibitors,
thiazide diuretics). LP typically follows a chronic course with gradual, spontaneous remission

within 2 years.
