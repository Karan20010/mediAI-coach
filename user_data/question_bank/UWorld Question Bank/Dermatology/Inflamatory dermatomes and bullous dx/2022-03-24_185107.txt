(Choice A) IgE-mediated degranulation is typically associated with environmental exposures
such as foods or vespid stings or with medications such as beta-lactam and sulfonamide
antibiotics. Opioids can cause IgE-dependent degranulation (very rare), but IgE-independent

reactions are more common.

(Choice C) Inhibition of cyclooxygenase 1 by aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
can trigger urticaria in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria. These medications shunt
arachidonic acid metabolites toward formation of leukotrienes, which increase vascular
permeability.

(Choice D) Serum sickness is a type III hypersensitivity reaction caused by precipitation of
circulating immune complexes. Typical symptoms include fever, pruritic rash, and arthralgias
starting 7-14 days after antigen exposure. Common triggers include beta-lactam and
sulfonamide antibiotics.

(Choice E) Acute allergic contact dermatitis is caused by a T cell-mediated type IV (delayed)
hypersensitivity reaction to an antigen on the skin surface. Gross findings include
erythematous, papulovesicular, weeping lesions.
