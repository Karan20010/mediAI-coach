Educational objective:

First-line treatment options for localized psoriasis include high-potency topical corticosteroids
and vitamin D analogs. Vitamin D analogs inhibit T-cell and keratinocyte proliferation and
stimulate keratinocyte differentiation. Corticosteroids also have anti-inflammatory and
antiproliferative properties; their mechanism of action is complementary to the vitamin D

analogs.
