This patient with well-demarcated, scaly, erythematous plaques involving extensor surfaces of
the extremities has typical features of psoriasis. Patients with psoriasis frequently develop
additional complications, including:

¢ Psoriatic arthritis
¢ Nail changes: yellow-brown discoloration, pitting, thickening, or crumbling
¢ Inflammatory disorders of the eye: conjunctivitis, blepharitis, or uveitis

Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory disorder affecting the synovium and often the insertion
of tendons and ligaments (ie, enthesopathy). It typically manifest as asymmetric oligoarthritis
or symmetric polyarthritis (resembling rheumatoid arthritis) that often affects the distal
interphalangeal joints. In severe cases, patients can develop an aggressive and destructive
arthritis mutilans. The risk is increased in patients who are human leukocyte antigen B27—
positive.
