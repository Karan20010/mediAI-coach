Educational objective:

Keratinocytes are responsible for wound reepithelization. They migrate into the wound from its
edges and are repopulated by replication within the stratum basale. Keratinocytes continue to
migrate and proliferate until they contact other similar cells, a regulatory mechanism known as

contact inhibition.
