Educational objective:

Fibroblast and vascular proliferation (ie, granulation tissue) induced by vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) is essential to normal wound healing. However, if this tissue proliferation
becomes excessive (eg, in wounds left to heal by secondary intention), the resulting
hypergranulation tissue can impair wound reepithelization and remodeling.
