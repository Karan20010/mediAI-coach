Ten days after surgery, this patient's intact, healing surgical incisions are most likely
undergoing a type of neovascularization called angiogenesis, the process by which new
blood vessels sprout and grow into the wound from surrounding, uninjured vessels.

Angiogenesis primarily occurs during the proliferation phase of wound healing, which begins
around day 3 (overlapping with the end of the inflammatory phase) and lasts approximately 5
weeks. During the proliferation phase, fibroblasts multiply and synthesize ground substance
and type III collagen, which form an amorphous gel into which new capillaries can grow. In
addition, fibroblasts secrete fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth
factor, which stimulate endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiationâ€”leading to
the formation of new capillaries.

By increasing the number of capillaries within the healing surgical incision, angiogenesis
increases blood flow to the area, causing the pink and slightly warm characteristics of the
wound at this stage. The incision's newly formed epithelium (ie, reepithelialization) typically
has a shiny appearance as well.
