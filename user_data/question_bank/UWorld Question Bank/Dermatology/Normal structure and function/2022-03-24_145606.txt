has a shiny appearance as well.

(Choices A and C) Degranulation of mast cells and infiltration of polymorphonuclear
leukocytes occur during the inflammation phase, which starts within hours of the injury and
lasts approximately 5 days. During this phase, there is often moderate edema, redness,
and/or warmth of the wound and nearby soft tissues due to high levels of inflammatory
mediators (eg, IL-1, TNF-alpha). In contrast, this patient's wound is 10 days out from surgery
and most likely in the proliferation phase.

(Choice B) Extensive collagen crosslinking, which increases the tensile strength of the
wound, occurs during the final phase of wound healing, maturation. Maturation typically
occurs between 3 weeks and 1-2 years (not 10 days post-surgery).

(Choice E) Collagen synthesis begins during the proliferation phase, along with
angiogenesis. However, fibroblasts predominantly synthesize type III collagen; type III
collagen is then replaced with type I collagen during the maturation phase. Type |! collagen is
primarily found in articular and hyaline cartilage rather than the skin.

Educational objective:
Angiogenesis is the process by which new blood vessels are formed. It primarily occurs during
