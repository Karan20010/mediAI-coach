have a varied gross appearance (eg, macular, nodular, lichenous) but would be characterized
histologically by homogenous, eosinophilic dermal deposits.

(Choice B) During the remodeling phase of wound healing, fibroblasts and type III collagen in
granulation tissue are gradually (ie, over weeks to years) replaced with myofibroblasts and
type | collagen, forming a scar. Abnormalities in this process result in unchecked production of
collagen fibers, forming a hypertrophic scar or keloid months after the initial wound.

(Choice C) Individuals with a resected squamous cell carcinoma lesion are at risk of
developing a secondary lesion at the same site. However, these recurrences typically develop
years postresection, and histology would typically show acanthosis, keratinization, and
evidence of keratinocyte dysplasia (eg, keratinocytes with pleomorphic nuclei and abundant
cytoplasm).

(Choice D) Neutrophils are essential to the normal inflammatory response in wound healing;
they prevent infection and release cytokines and growth factors that allow wound healing to
progress. However, protracted inflammation and excessive release of reactive oxygen species

by neutrophils in a wound can cause tissue damage that delays wound healing, resulting in a
