(Choices A and C) Cromolyn is a mast cell stabilizer that inhibits histamine granule release
from mast cells and can be used to treat allergic rhinitis or systemic mastocytosis.
Omalizumab, a monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, prevents binding of IgE to mast cells and

basophils and is most commonly used to treat persistent, severe asthma.

(Choice D) IL-4 stimulates IgE production and the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells to Th2
cells, which exacerbate the inflammatory response in atopic dermatitis. Dupilumab is a human
monoclonal antibody that inhibits IL-4 action by antagonizing the IL-4 receptor. It can be
considered for severe atopic dermatitis refractory to topical therapies.

(Choice E) Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen on B lymphocytes.
Once bound, rituximab initiates complement and cell-mediated B-cell cytotoxicity. It is used to
treat hematologic malignancies (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and rheumatologic
diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis).

Educational objective:

Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition that can be treated with calcineurin inhibitors
(eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus) as second-line therapy after topical corticosteroids. Calcineurin
inhibitors work by inhibiting T-cell signaling needed to transcribe the proinflammatory cytokine
IL-2, thereby decreasing inflammation.
