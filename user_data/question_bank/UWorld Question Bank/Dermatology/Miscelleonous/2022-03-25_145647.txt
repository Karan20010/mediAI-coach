A 6-year-old girl is brought to the clinic due to an itchy rash on her face. The patient's mother
says the rash began approximately 3 weeks ago as dry skin on both of her cheeks. Over the
past few days, it has progressed with areas of weeping and increased redness, and the patient
has had to wear mittens to limit irritation from constant scratching. The patient has a history of
similar rashs involving the flexural areas of her elbows and knees that resolved following
treatment with topical corticosteroids. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination shows
erythema of the bilateral cheeks and chin with crusting and oozing. The patient is prescribed a
course of topical tacrolimus. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of action of
this drug?

A. Inhibition of histamine granule release (3%)
YB. Inhibition of T-lymphocyte signaling (83%)
C. Prevention of IgE binding to mast cells (4%)

D. Selective blockade of the IL-4 receptor (7%)

E. Stimulation of B-lymphocyte apoptosis (1%)
