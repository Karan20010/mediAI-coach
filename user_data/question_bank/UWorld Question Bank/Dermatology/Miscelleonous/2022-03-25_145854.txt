This patient's eye findings and white hair are consistent with oculocutaneous albinism
(OCA), an autosomal recessive disorder of melanin production or distribution. The most
common defect is in the enzyme tyrosinase, which converts tyrosine to DOPA in the first step
of the melanin biosynthetic pathway.

Melanin is produced in melanosomes (specialized organelles within melanocytes), which are
then transferred to keratinocytes to provide ultraviolet protection. In patients with OCA, lack of
this pigment results in the characteristic white hair and skin and translucent, light-colored
irides. Iris transillumination occurs due to the reflection of light off the retina, causing the iris
to appear red. Because the translucent irides allow in excess light, patients often have
photophobia (light sensitivity).

In addition to pigmentation, melanin plays a role in guiding embryologic development of ocular
structures. Without melanin, patients have misrouted and underdeveloped optic nerve
fibers and hypoplastic or absent foveae, as seen in this infant. This leads to findings of
decreased visual acuity and, in turn, strabismus (ie, ocular misalignment) and/or
nystagmus.
