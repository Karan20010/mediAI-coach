Educational objective:

Actinic keratosis (AK) develops on chronically sun-exposed areas of the skin in predisposed
individuals. The lesions consist of erythematous papules with a central scale and a rough
"sandpaper-like" texture. AKs are considered premalignant lesions and have the potential to
progress to squamous cell carcinoma.
