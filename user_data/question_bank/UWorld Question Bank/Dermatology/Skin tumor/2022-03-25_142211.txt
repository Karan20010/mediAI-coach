This patient's pearly nodule with telangiectasias on the inner canthus is most consistent with
basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a common form of skin cancer that most often occurs on the
face; risk factors include fair skin and a history of heavy sun exposure (eg, while constructing
homes).

BCCs arise from keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis or hair follicle, most
commonly as a result of ultraviolet radiationâ€”induced mutations in the hedgehog signaling
pathway (causing hyperactivation and uncontrolled cell proliferation) or the 7P53 tumor
suppressor gene (causing inactivation). Microscopically, the malignant basaloid cells
characteristically form nests or strands in the dermis, with cells at the periphery often
displaying parallel alignment (ie, peripheral palisading).

As in this patient, BCC frequently appears as a pink or skin-colored papule, often with a
pearly or translucent quality and/or central telangiectatic vessels. Some lesions may
develop a raised border and central ulceration. BCCs rarely metastasize but may grow locally
and invade nearby tissues and structures.
