Educational objective:

Actinic keratoses (AKs) are small (usually <1 cm), erythematous epidermal lesions with
adherent scale that are the result of chronic sun exposure. Histologic findings include
keratinocyte atypia, hyperkeratosis, and parakeratosis. A small percentage of AKs progress to
invasive squamous cell carcinoma; therefore, frequent monitoring is necessary.
