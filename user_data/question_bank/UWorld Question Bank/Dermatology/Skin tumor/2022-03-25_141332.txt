This patient's rapidly growing lesion is consistent with an infantile hemangioma, a common,
benign vascular tumor characterized by neoplastic proliferation of endothelial cells.

Infantile hemangiomas occur most often on the head or neck. They present within weeks of
birth as a solitary red papule or nodule. The lesion shows characteristic rapid growth for
several months followed by spontaneous, gradual regression over several years.

Growth of infantile hemangiomas is thought to be related to the de novo production of a
vascular network (ie, vasculogenesis) and/or the sprouting of new blood vessels from existing
ones (ie, angiogenesis). Microscopic examination during the growth phase shows multiple
lobules of densely packed capillaries lined by plump endothelium. As the lesion regresses,
the endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, and the capillaries are replaced by fibrofatty tissue.
