Seborrheic keratosis is a common epidermal tumor that presents as a tan or brown, round
lesion with a well-demarcated border and "stuck-on" appearance. Microscopic examination
shows small cells resembling basal cells, with pigmentation, hyperkeratosis, and keratin-
containing cysts. Rapid onset of numerous lesions is often associated with internal

malignancy (Leser-Tr√©lat sign).
