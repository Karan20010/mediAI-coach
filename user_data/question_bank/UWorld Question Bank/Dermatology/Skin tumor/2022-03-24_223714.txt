A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to 2 months of fatigue and persistent,
nonproductive cough. He has a history of coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction.
Three years ago, he underwent wide local excision of a melanoma on his posterior neck. The
patient has a 50-pack-year smoking history. Vital signs are within normal limits. Chest
radiograph reveals multiple lung lesions and hilar lymphadenopathy. Histopathology from one
of the biopsied lung lesions is shown below after staining with hematoxylin and eosin.
