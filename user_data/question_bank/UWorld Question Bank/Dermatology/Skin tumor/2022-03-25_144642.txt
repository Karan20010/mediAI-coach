typically removed or destroyed (eg, cryotherapy).

(Choice B) Basal cell carcinomas frequently present as skin-colored, pearly papules or
nodules, sometimes with central telangiectasias. Histologic examination typically shows nests
of basaloid cells with peripheral nuclear palisading.

(Choice C) Keratoacanthomas usually present as dome-shaped nodules with central
keratinous plugs. Histologic examination typically shows a proliferation of well-differentiated
squamous epithelium with eosinophilic cytoplasm that surrounds (and forms a lip over the rim
of) a keratin-filled crater.

(Choice D) Malignant melanomas usually present as asymmetric, pigmented patches or
nodules, often with irregular borders and color variegation. Histologic examination typically
shows proliferation of melanocytes, often with cytoplasmic melanin granules, that demonstrate
cellular atypia (eg, large nuclei, prominent nucleoli).

(Choice E) Seborrheic keratoses are benign lesions that are usually well circumscribed,
pigmented or flesh colored, and have a "stuck-on" appearance. Histologic examination
typically shows small cells resembling basal cells, with variable pigmentation, hyperkeratosis
(thickened stratum corneum), and keratin-containing cysts.
