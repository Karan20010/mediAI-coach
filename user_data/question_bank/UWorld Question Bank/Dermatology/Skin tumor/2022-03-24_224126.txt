Educational objective:

Transforming growth factor-8 (TGF-ยง) is critical for fibroblast migration, proliferation, and
connective tissue synthesis. Increased TGF-8 activity is responsible for the
hypertrophic/keloid scarring and fibrosis of the lung, liver, and kidney that occur with chronic
inflammation.
