This patient with a painful, growing lesion at the site of a prior injury likely has a keloid.

Keloids and hypertrophic scars consist of connective tissue rich in fibroblasts, myofibroblasts,
and bundles of collagen fibers and result from excessive collagen formation during the
remodeling phase of wound healing, which typically occurs between 3 weeks and 2 years after
an injury. The abundant collagen fibers are arranged in a disorganized fashion in keloids and
parallel in hypertrophic scars.

Normally, during the proliferation phase of wound healing, fibroblasts proliferate, synthesize
collagen and ground substance, and differentiate into myofibroblasts. These processes are
promoted by transformation growth factor beta (TGF beta), which typically diminishes upon
completion of wound repair, when the wound transitions to the maturation phase. In keloids,
however, TGF beta is overexpressed, with little regulation. As a result, keloids extend
beyond the borders of the original wound, do not regress, and often recur after resection. In
contrast, hypertrophic scars are limited to the original wound borders and may regress
spontaneously.

Keloids can have a familial tendency, particularly in individuals of Asian or African ethnicity.
They are often raised and painful/pruritic and are usually diagnosed clinically.
