This patient presents with skin and mucosal telangiectasias as well as recurrent severe
nosebleeds. The most likely diagnosis is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary
hemorrhagic telangiectasia), a condition characterized by the autosomal dominant inheritance
of congenital telangiectasias to the skin and mucous membranes. The mucosal involvement
may affect the lips, oronasopharynx, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. In
rare instances, the telangiectasias of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome may occur in the brain,
liver, and spleen as well. Rupture of these telangiectasias may cause epistaxis,
gastrointestinal bleeding, and hematuria.

(Choice A) Von Recklinghausen's disease, or neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), is an inherited
peripheral nervous system tumor syndrome. Patients develop neurofibromas, optic nerve
gliomas, Lisch nodules (pigmented nodules of the iris), and café au lait spots (hyperpigmented
cutaneous macules).

(Choice B) Neurofibromatosis type 2 is an autosomal dominant nervous system tumor
syndrome, in which patients commonly develop bilateral cranial nerve VIII schwannomas and
multiple meningiomas.
