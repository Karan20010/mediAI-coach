This patient's forehead lesions are characteristic of actinic keratoses (AKs), which are small,
scaly, erythematous lesions with a sandpaper texture occurring on sun-exposed areas. On
light microscopy, AKs show hyperkeratosis (hyperplasia of the stratum corneum),
parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum), and atypical keratinocytes with
pleomorphic nuclei and multiple mitoses. There may also be pigment irregularities and dilated
blood vessels affecting the surrounding skin, which are consistent with chronic sun exposure.

AKs do not invade the dermis and are considered to be premalignant lesions. Over several
years, a small percentage of AKs transform into invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC),
a change reflected by an increase in lesion size and thickness, dermal invasion, and
metastatic potential.
