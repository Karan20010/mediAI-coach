associated with more aggressive cancers (eg, oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma,
pancreatic carcinoma) rather than BCC (Choice E).

(Choice A) Individuals with a history of BCC are at increased risk for developing additional
lesions; however, the lesions more commonly occur in areas of the body that have been
exposed to extensive UV radiation (eg, the face rather than the trunk) because it is the most

important risk factor for BCC.

(Choices B and D) BCCs almost never undergo extensive regional lymphatic spread or rapid
metastasis via hematogenous dissemination. In contrast, malignant melanoma frequently
spreads via both pathways. Biopsy of melanoma typically reveals atypical melanocytes (eg,
large irregular nuclei, prominent nucleoli) that may contain cytoplasmic melanin granules.

Educational objective:

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) commonly presents as a pearly, skin-colored papule/nodule on the
face. Biopsy classically shows nests of basaloid keratinocytes with peripheral palisading and
clefting artifact. Unresected BCCs rarely metastasize but may undergo continued local
growth, causing progressive surrounding tissue destruction.
