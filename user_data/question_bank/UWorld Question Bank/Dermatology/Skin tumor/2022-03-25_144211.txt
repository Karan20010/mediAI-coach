Foreign bodies (eg, retained sutures) can elicit a granulomatous response, seen clinically as
a tender, erythematous, brown or purple papule, nodule, or plaque. Granulomas are
characterized microscopically by aggregates of activated macrophages that assume an
epithelioid appearance. They are often surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes that synthesize
the cytokines responsible for granuloma maintenance. Multinucleated giant cells, derived from
the fusion of several macrophages, can also be found in granulomas.

Granuloma formation is a complex process that occurs over several days to weeks in
response to an antigen that cannot be eradicated by more acute inflammatory mechanisms
(eg, killing by neutrophils). As infiltrating macrophages engulf the antigenic debris, material
resistant to digestion persists in the cytoplasm and causes macrophage activation. This
results in further macrophage maturation and formation of a granuloma, which walls off the
offending agent.

(Choice A) Excess granulation tissue formation (hypergranulation) usually occurs in a wound
left to heal by secondary intention. Light microscopy would show proliferation of fibroblasts,
collagen deposition, inflammatory cells, and numerous capillaries. cinete Wrnclavr
