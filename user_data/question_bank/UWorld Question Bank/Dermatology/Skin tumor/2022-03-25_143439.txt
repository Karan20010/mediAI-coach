(Choices A and B) Increased (vs decreased) activity of other factors that promote tissue
growth and wound healing (eg, insulin-like growth factor 1, platelet-derived growth factor
[PDGF]) are thought to contribute to keloid formation.

(Choice C) In addition to increased fibroblast proliferation in response to TGF beta, a
decreased (vs increased) fibroblast apoptosis rate may contribute to the greater number of
fibroblasts (and subsequent increased collagen production) seen in keloids.

(Choice E) Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) contribute to tissue remodeling through
degradation of the extracellular matrix, typically in a regulated fashion. Decreased MMP
activity (leading to decreased extracellular matrix degradation) may contribute to keloid
formation. In contrast, MMP overproduction is often present in chronic (ie, nonhealing)
wounds.

Educational objective:

Keloids result from excessive collagen formation during the remodeling phase of wound
healing, which occurs due to overexpression of transformation growth factor beta and
excessive fibroblast proliferation. They typically present as raised, painful, and pruritic lesions
that grow beyond the original wound borders.
