A 67-year-old man comes to the office after he noticed several nodules in his left axilla. He
has a history of malignant melanoma on his upper back, which was treated with wide surgical
excision 4 years ago. The patient undergoes biopsy of an axillary lesion, and histopathology
reveals melanoma recurrence. Subsequent whole-body positron emission scan shows diffuse
metastatic disease involving the lungs, liver, and left axillary nodes. Checkpoint inhibitor
therapy with pembrolizumab is initiated, which leads to significant reduction in the size of the
axillary nodules and metastatic lesions. Which of the following best correlates with the
treatment response in this patient?

A. Increased intratumor macrophages (12%)
B. Intense desmoplastic reaction (8%)
C. Ischemic tumor necrosis (16%)

YD. CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration (57%)

E. Peritumoral neutrophilic reaction (5%)
