(Choice A) Interferon-f is an antiviral cytokine that also decreases inflammatory cell
movement across the blood-brain barrier. Interferon-8 analogs can be used to treat multiple

sclerosis.

(Choice B) Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is produced by T,17 cells and recruits neutrophils in addition
to stimulating production of antimicrobial peptides. IL-17 improves host defense against fungi
and bacteria at epithelial and mucosal surfaces. Dysregulation has been implicated in many
autoimmune conditions.

(Choice C) Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is a proinflammatory transcription factor that
regulates cytokine production, adhesion molecule expression, and cell survival. Increased NF-
KB activity is found in many cancers and inflammatory diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis,
inflammatory bowel disease).

(Choice E) Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is a cytokine secreted by activated macrophages
and T cells that promotes leukocyte recruitment, induces the systemic inflammatory response
(eg, fever, acute-phase proteins), and regulates apoptosis.

Educational objective:
Transforming growth factor-B (TGF-8) is critical for fibroblast migration, proliferation, and Activate Windows
