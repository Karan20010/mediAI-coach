(Choice A) Acanthosis nigricans is characterized by hyperpigmented, velvety plaques at
flexural areas (eg, axilla, posterior neck). It is associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity, and
visceral malignancies.

(Choice B) Actinic keratosis presents with hyperkeratotic lesions in sun-exposed areas of the
scalp, ears, face, and hands. These lesions are unpigmented and, despite the similar name,
are unrelated to seborrheic keratosis.

(Choice C) Lichen planus is characterized by the "5 Ps": polygonal, planar, pruritic, purplish
plaques on the wrists, hands, trunk, and legs. Fine white lines (Wickham striae) may be
