A bluish neoplasm occurring underneath the nail bed may be either a glomus tumor
(glomangioma) or a subungual melanoma. Both are rare diagnoses. Melanomas are
composed of melanocytes, which have the function of pigmentation. Because ‘pigmentation’ is

not among the answer choices, glomus tumor is the most likely diagnosis.

12 A glomangioma is a tumor of the modified smooth muscle cells of a glomus body. Glomus
bodies are numerous small, encapsulated neurovascular organs found in the dermis of the nail
15 bed, the pads of the fingers and toes, and the ears. Each glomus body is composed of an
afferent arteriole connected to a richly innervated, muscular arteriovenous anastomosis, which
is is then connected to an efferent vein. Modified smooth muscle cells are arranged in layers
around these vascular channels. The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the
21 skin surface in cold temperatures in order to prevent heat loss, and to direct blood flow to the
skin surface in hot environments to facilitate the dissipation of heat.

(Choice A) Extremity receptors responsible for proprioception include muscle spindles, Golgi
26 tendon organs, Pacinian corpuscles, and cutaneous touch receptors (including Meissner's
corpuscles, Merkel's disks, and free nerve endings). A tumor of any component of these

29 structures (e.g. neurons, connective tissue cells) would not have a bluish coloration.
