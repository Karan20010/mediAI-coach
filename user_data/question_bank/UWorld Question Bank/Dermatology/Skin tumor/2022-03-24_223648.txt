Typically associated with hyperlipidemia or lymphoproliferative malignancies, xanthomas are
yellow nodules composed of lipid-laden histiocytes in the dermis. Clinically, xanthomas can be
divided into five categories: eruptive xanthomas (yellow papules that abruptly appear when
plasma triglycerides and lipids increase); tuberous and tendinous xanthomas (the latter are
often present on Achilles tendons and the extensor tendons of the fingers); plane xanthomas
(linear lesions in skin folds that are strongly associated with primary biliary cirrhosis); and
xanthelasma (soft eyelid or periorbital plaques with no associated lipid abnormalities in 50% of
affected individuals).

Histologically, xanthomas are composed of benign macrophages packed with finely
vacuolated, "foamy" cytoplasm. This cytoplasm contains high levels of cholesterol,
phospholipids, and triglycerides. The lipid-laden macrophages are frequently also enclosed by
inflammatory cells and fibrotic stroma. With xanthelasmas, the small aggregates of dermal
foam cells are present without any surrounding inflammation or fibrosis.
