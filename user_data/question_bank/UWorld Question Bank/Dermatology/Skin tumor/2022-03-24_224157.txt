A 65-year-old man comes to the office due to skin lesions on his back. He first noted the spots
5 years ago and says they are becoming more numerous. The lesions are occasionally
pruritic but are otherwise asymptomatic; he is not bothered significantly by them and made
today's appointment at his wife's insistence. Medical history is notable for hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. On examination, there are numerous pigmented
plaques, as shown in the image below.
