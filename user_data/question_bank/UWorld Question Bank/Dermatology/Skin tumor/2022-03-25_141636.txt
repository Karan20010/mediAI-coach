Xanthelasma is a cutaneous lesion commonly found on the eyelid that contains lipid-laden
macrophages (foam cells). These papules are typically yellow due to the location of the
foam cells in the superficial dermis. Xanthelasma and other forms of xanthoma (tuberous,
eruptive, tendinous) are classically associated with primary or secondary hyperlipidemia.
Chronic cholestatic processes including obstructive biliary lesions and primary biliary
cholangitis result in hypercholesterolemia due to leakage of bile back into the circulation,
leading to the formation of xanthelasmas. Correction of underlying lipid defects can lead to
slow resolution of these lesions.
