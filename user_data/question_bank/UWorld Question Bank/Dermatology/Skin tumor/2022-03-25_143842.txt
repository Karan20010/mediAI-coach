This patient has a large area of ecchymosis involving the upper extremity. Patients and
caregivers often use the term "bruise" to describe a variety of hemorrhagic skin lesions.
However, the specific visual appearance often gives clues to the etiology of the lesion.

An ecchymosis is a cutaneous or subcutaneous collection of extravasated blood measuring
at least 1 cm in diameter. Ecchymoses can arise superficially without a history of noticeable
trauma, but they frequently indicate a deep hemorrhage (hematoma) due to bony fracture,
ligamentous rupture, or muscular injury. These lesions do not blanch under pressure because
the red blood cells are not contained within the vasculature. Ecchymoses often pass through
an evolution of color change (blue or red to brown, green, and yellow), which can be used to
estimate the age of the injury. This property is especially useful in cases of suspected abuse
when other historical details are unknown or inconsistent.

(Choice A) Angiomas are chronic vascular malformations that most commonly appear as soft,
well-demarcated, red or blue nodules. Capillary hemangiomas are usually small and
superficial whereas cavernous hemangiomas are usually larger and more likely to involve
deeper structures.

(Choice C) Lentigines are small tan or brown macules most often seen on the sun-exposed
skin of a middle-aged or elderly person.
