(Choice D) Cystic hygromas are comprised of lymphatic cysts lined by a thin endothelium.
These benign tumors are often present at birth and are most commonly located on the
posterior neck and lateral chest wall. Cystic hygromas are frequently found in neonates with
Turner syndrome and Down syndrome.

(Choice E) Spider angiomas consist of a bright red central papule surrounded by several
outwardly radiating vessels that blanch with pressure and refill centrifugally upon release.
They are associated with increased estrogen states (eg, pregnancy, cirrhosis, oral
contraceptive use, estrogen supplement use).

(Choice F) Strawberry (also known as infantile or capillary) hemangiomas appear during the
first weeks of life. They initially grow rapidly and then frequently regress spontaneously by late
childhood. They are bright red when near the epidermis and more violaceous when deeper.

Educational objective:

Cherry hemangiomas are small, red, cutaneous papules common in aging adults. They do not
regress spontaneously and typically increase in number with age. Light microscopy of these
lesions shows proliferation of capillaries and post-capillary venules in the papillary dermis.
