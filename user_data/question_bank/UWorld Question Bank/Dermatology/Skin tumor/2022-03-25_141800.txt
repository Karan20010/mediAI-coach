Histologically, the accessory nipple is identical to a normal nipple. Findings include
hyperpigmentation, epidermal thickening, pilosebaceous structure of Montgomery areolar
tubercles, smooth muscle bundles (areola), and possible mammary glands and multiple ducts.

(Choice A) Congenital melanocytic nevi are caused by the clonal proliferation of benign
melanocytes in utero. They can be raised and are hyperpigmented.

(Choice B) Ephelides (eg, freckles) and solar lentigines are found on sun-exposed areas.
Ephelides are caused by increased melanin production by melanocytes, whereas solar lentigo
represents an increased proliferation of melanocytes themselves. They are both
hyperpigmented and flat, but solar lentigines are often larger and occur in adults.

(Choice D) Lipomas are benign fatty tumors contained within a fibrous capsule. They present
as a flesh-colored, soft, and painless subcutaneous mass.

(Choice E) Acrochorda, or skin tags, are benign and often pedunculated outgrowths of normal
skin. They often develop in locations that experience frequent friction, such as beneath breast
tissue or the axillae.
