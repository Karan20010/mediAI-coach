This patient with a history of HIV infection and a current CD4 count of 100/mm: now has 2
lesions on the right thigh that are violaceous, raised, and nontender. This presentation is
classic for Kaposi sarcoma (KS), the most common tumor in HIV-positive individuals, which
usually presents as multiple red, purple, or brown papules or plaques and appears first on the
lower extremities before spreading proximally.

KS is a vascular tumor that is strongly associated with both HIV and human herpesvirus type
8 (HHV-8). HH\V-8 infects vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells, causing them to
differentiate into a mixed phenotype thought to increase oncogenic potential. The HHV-8
genome contains several viral oncogenes that inhibit cell cycle regulation and apoptosis,
thereby promoting endothelial cell growth and tumorigenesis. Biopsy of cutaneous KS
typically reveals a dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with slit-like vascular
spaces, red blood cell extravasation, and inflammation.

(Choice A) Basal cell carcinomas arise from basal keratinocytes, typically due to ultraviolet
radiation—induced mutations. Lesions are commonly pink or skin-colored (vs violaceous),
pearly or translucent, and located in sun-exposed areas such as the face (vs the thigh).

(Choice C) Cutaneous mastocytosis is caused by the pathologic accumulation of mast cells
