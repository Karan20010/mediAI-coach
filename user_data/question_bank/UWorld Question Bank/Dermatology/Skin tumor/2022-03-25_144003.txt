This image shows the typical presentation of acanthosis nigricans (AN), which occurs most
commonly in flexural areas. The most common locations are the axillae, posterior neck, and
groin, but it may appear on other areas of the body such as the palms, soles, and oral mucosa
& vermilion border. On physical examination, these lesions appear as hyperkeratotic,
hyperpigmented plaques with a classic "velvety" texture. Skin tags (acrochordons) are
pedunculated outgrowths of normal skin that are commonly present on regions affected by
acanthosis nigricans.

AN is associated with a number of diseases. Depending on the underlying condition, it is
divided into benign and malignant forms.

1. Benign AN is commonly associated with insulin resistance. Increased levels of insulin and
insulin-like growth factors stimulate epidermal and dermal proliferation.

2. Malignant AN is associated with underlying neoplasms, especially of the gastrointestinal
and genitourinary tracts. The sudden appearance of such skin changes in middle-aged or
elderly patients is suggestive of underlying malignancy. Gastric adenocarcinoma is the
most common cause of malignant AN.

(Choices A and E) Hypersecretion of calcitonin (as in medullary thyroid cancer) and vitamin
D resistance are not associated with AN. ctivate V
