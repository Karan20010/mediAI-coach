The main environmental risk factor for cutaneous melanoma is increased exposure to
ultraviolet radiation (eg, solar or tanning bed sources), which can cause malignant
transformation of melanocytes. The risk of melanoma is also increased by mutations in
specific genetic factors, most commonly tumor suppressor genes and various oncogenes.
BRAF is a protein kinase involved in activating the signaling pathways of melanocyte
proliferation. BRAF mutation V600E (valine — glutamic acid), seen in 40%-60% of patients
with melanoma, leads to greatly increased activation of the signaling pathways for
melanocyte growth, survival, and metastasis.

Vemurafenib, a potent inhibitor of mutated BRAF, has significant anti-tumor effects with
improved survival and long-term outcomes in advanced stage V600E-positive melanoma
patients. The presence of this BRAF mutation in this patient's tissue sample most likely
indicates a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.

(Choice A) Glioblastoma is more likely to present as a single lesion; BRAF mutations are less
common than with melanoma.

(Choice C) Prostate cancer is associated with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, not BRAF
mutations. BRCA mutations also increase the risk of breast cancer.
