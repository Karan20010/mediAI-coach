(Choice B) Light touch is mediated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors, which may be
encapsulated or free nerve endings. A tumor of these structures would not have a blue hue.

(Choice D) Alymphangioma is a tumor of the cells involved in lymphatic drainage. These
benign lymphatic neoplasms are analogous to vascular hemangiomas. Lymphangiomas tend
to occur subepidermally, in the head, neck, and axilla. They consist of networks of
endothelium-lined lymph spaces. Because they do not contain pigmented cells or red blood
cells, lymphangiomas would be unlikely to have a bluish appearance.

(Choice E) A tumor of antigen-processing cells would be either a histiocytosis or a
lymphoma. When there is cutaneous involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis, patients
present with erythematous papules, nodules, and/or scaling plaques. B-cell lymphomas very
rarely involve the skin.

(Choice F) The basal epidermal cells of the nail matrix are responsible for nail growth.
Tumors originating from the epidermis include squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and basal
cell carcinomas (BCC). SCC does not involve pigmented cells. Although BCC may involve
pigmented cells, the majority of these lesions (85%) appear on the head and neck; BCC rarely
affects the dorsum of the hands.
