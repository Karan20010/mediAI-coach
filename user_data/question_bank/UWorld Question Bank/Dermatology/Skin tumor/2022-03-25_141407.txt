(Choice A) Enchondroma and chondrosarcoma are examples of cartilage-forming
neoplasms. Enchondromas are benign and commonly involve the bones of the hands and
feet. Chondrosarcomas are malignant lesions that usually involve the axial skeleton of older
adults.

(Choice C) Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, cutaneous tumor of neuroendocrine cell origin that
presents as a rapidly expanding, firm, pink nodule. This condition is nearly exclusive to older
adults.

(Choice D) Leiomyoma (benign) and leiomyosarcoma (malignant) are smooth muscle
neoplasms most commonly found in the genitourinary (eg, uterus) or gastrointestinal tract.
Lesions can involve the skin but present as small, painful nodules. In addition, these tumors
are exceedingly rare in young children and do not grow rapidly.

(Choice E) Squamous epithelial cells may give rise to squamous cell carcinoma, which, in
contrast to this case, appears as an ulcerated or hyperkeratotic plaque in adults with sun-
damaged skin.

Educational objective:
Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors composed of proliferating endothelial cells
