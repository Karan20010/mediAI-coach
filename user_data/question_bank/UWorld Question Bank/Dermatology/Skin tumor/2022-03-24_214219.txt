(Choice A) Basal cell carcinoma usually appears on the face as a nodular, flesh colored
papule. Although scaly trunk lesions can occasionally occur, this tumor is derived from basal
epithelial cells and would not stain positive for melanocyte markers.

(Choice C) Paget disease of the breast is a rare form of breast cancer that occurs due to
intraductal spread of an underlying breast malignancy to the nipple skin. Although this can
cause an itchy, ulcerative nipple lesion, biopsy would show malignant, intraepithelial
adenocarcinoma cells (ie, Paget cells) within the epidermis that would not stain positive for
melanocyte markers.

(Choice D) Seborrheic keratosis is a benign skin lesion that is well demarcated (appears
"stuck on") with a verrucous surface. These lesions are derived from immature keratinocytes
and would not stain positive for multiple melanin markers.

(Choice E) Squamous cell carcinoma is most common on the head and neck but can also
occasionally arise on the trunk. It generally appears as a hyperkeratotic nodule, papule, or
plaque. Because it is derived from epithelial cells (not melanocytes), multiple melanin markers
would not be positive.
