Melanocytic nevi are benign neoplasms composed of round, uniform melanocytes (nevus
cells) that are mitotically quiescent. They are typically <6 mm in diameter and have a regular
outline with a symmetric, sharply demarcated border and a homogeneous surface.
Melanocytic nevi are progressive lesions that typically mature through the following phases:

1. Junctional nevi are characterized by aggregates of nevus cells limited to the
dermoepidermal junction (Choice C). They typically appear as flat, black to brown
macules with darker color in the center than in the periphery and preserved skin markings.

2. Compound nevi form as the aggregates of nevus cells extend into the dermis. They are
raised papules with uniform brown to tan pigmentation. This patient's lesion is a
compound nevus because it has both dermal and epidermal involvement.

. Intradermal nevi are older lesions in which the epidermal nests of nevus cells have been
lost. The remaining dermal nevus cells lose tyrosinase activity and produce little to no
pigment. Intradermal nevi are often skin-colored, dome-shaped, and sometimes
pedunculated.
