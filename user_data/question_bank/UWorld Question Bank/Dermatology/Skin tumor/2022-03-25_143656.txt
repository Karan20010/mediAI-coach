Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) is an autosomal
dominant condition marked by the presence of telangiectasias in the skin as well as the
mucous membranes of the lips, oronasopharynx, respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and
urinary tract. Rupture of these telangiectasias may cause epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding,

or hematuria.
