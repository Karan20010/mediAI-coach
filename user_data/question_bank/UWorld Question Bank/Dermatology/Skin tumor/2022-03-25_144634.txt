On histologic examination, AKs show disorganized keratinocytes with signs of atypia, such as
nuclei that are hyperchromatic (ie, stained a darker color) and pleomorphic (ie, varying in
size/shape). The presence of mitoses reflects proliferative activity, and corresponding
epidermal thickening (ie, acanthosis) may be present. The overlying stratum corneum is
also often thickened (ie, hyperkeratosis) with retained nuclei (ie, parakeratosis). AKs are
considered premalignant lesions on a continuum with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The
extent of epidermal involvement differentiates AK from SCC:

¢ AK: Atypical keratinocytes do not involve the full thickness of the epidermis.

¢ SCC in situ: Atypical keratinocytes involve the full thickness of the epidermis without
infiltration into the dermis.
¢ Invasive SCC: Atypical keratinocytes involve the full thickness of the epidermis and

penetrate through the epidermal basement membrane into the dermis or deeper tissues.

Because a small percentage of AKs transform into invasive SCC, diagnosed lesions are
typically removed or destroyed (eg, cryotherapy).

(Choice B) Basal cell carcinomas frequently present as skin-colored, pearly papules or
nodules, sometimes with central telangiectasias. Histologic examination typically shows nests
