(Choice C) Sturge-Weber syndrome (encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis) is a rare congenital
neurocutaneous disorder characterized by the presence of cutaneous facial angiomas as well
as leptomeningeal angiomas. This condition is associated with mental retardation, seizures,
hemiplegia, and skull radiopacities. Skull radiographs may show characteristic "tram-track"
calcifications.

(Choice D) Von Hippel—Lindau disease is a rare, autosomal dominant condition characterized
by the presence of capillary hemangioblastomas in the retina and/or cerebellum, as well as
congenital cysts and/or neoplasms in the kidney, liver, and pancreas. Patients are also at
increased risk for renal cell carcinoma, which can be bilateral.

(Choice E) Although tuberous sclerosis (TS) may cause kidney, liver, and pancreatic cysts,
central nervous system (CNS) involvement manifests not as angiomatous lesions, but as
cortical and subependymal hamartomas. This autosomal dominant syndrome is also
characterized by cutaneous angiofibromas (adenoma sebaceum), visceral cysts, and a variety
of other hamartomas, as well as renal angiomyolipomas and cardiac rhabdomyomas.
Clinically, seizures are a major complication.
