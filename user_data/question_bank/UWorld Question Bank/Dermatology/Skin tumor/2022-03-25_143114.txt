Oral thrush (eg, white buccal and palatal plaques) and bilateral tender lymphadenopathy in a
patient with a history of intravenous drug use are highly suggestive of HIV infection. HIV is
further supported by the presence of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), a vascular tumor common in
HIV-positive individuals and an AIDS-defining malignancy.

KS is strongly associated with human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8), as well as an impaired T-
cell response (eg, HIV infection). HHV-8 infects vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells,
causing their differentiation into a mixed phenotype thought to increase oncogenic potential.
The viral genome also contains several oncogenes that cause endothelial proliferation (eg,
inhibit cell cycle regulation and apoptosis), thus promoting tumorigenesis. In addition, HHV-8
induces production of angiogenic and inflammatory cytokines, creating a favorable
environment for cell growth.

AIDS-related KS most commonly involves the skin, presenting as multiple red, purple, or
brown papules or plaques that appear on the lower extremities. Lesions can also develop
on the mucosal membranes of the face and genitals, and frequently spread internally to
involve the lungs and gastrointestinal tract (eg, bleeding/hemoptysis). Histopathology
typically shows a proliferation of spindle-shaped endothelial cells with slit-like vascular spaces,
red blood cell extravasation, and inflammation.
