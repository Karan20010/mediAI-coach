(Choice A) Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common skin cancer. It arises on sun-
exposed areas and has a very low tendency to metastasize (in contrast to melanoma). BCC
often presents as pearly papules with central depression or ulceration. Histologically, BCC
features nests of basaloid cells and peripheral palisading of nuclei. It is far more likely for AK
to progress to SCC than to BCC.

(Choice B) Dermatofibromas (superficial benign fibrous histiocytomas) result from the benign
proliferation of fibroblasts. They commonly arise on the lower extremities as solitary nodules.

(Choice C) Kaposi sarcoma is associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) and classically
occurs in patients with HIV. Lesions typically appear as palpable macules, plaques, and
nodules that are usually a dark brown to violet color.

(Choice D) Melanoma is a cancer arising from the malignant transformation of melanocytes.
Lesions have irregular borders and marked color variegation. AK is not a precursor to
melanoma.

(Choice E) Psoriasis commonly presents as hyperkeratotic plaques that affect the scalp,
knees, and elbows. It is characterized histologically by clubbed rete ridges, hyperkeratosis,
neutrophils in the stratum corneum, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Activate Windows
