The most common congenital breast anomalies in women and men are accessory nipples
(ie, polythelia, supernumerary nipple). They are due to failure of involution of the
mammary ridge. Accessory nipples are usually asymptomatic. However, they may swell or
become tender similar to normal breast tissue before or during menses, pregnancy, and
lactation. They can occur anywhere along the embryonic milk line between the axilla and
perineum and are bilateral in 50% of patients. Treatment is normally not needed.
Histologically, the accessory nipple is identical to a normal nipple. Findings include
hyperpigmentation, epidermal thickening, pilosebaceous structure of Montgomery areolar
tubercles, smooth muscle bundles (areola), and possible mammary glands and multiple ducts.
