This patient who had multiple sunburns as a child has a skin lesion with several classic
features of melanoma, including Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter
26 mm (hash marks), and Evolution over time.

Color variegation is a common feature of melanoma; the different colors represent different
areas of activity within the tumor:

e Red areas are due to vessel ectasia (dilation) and local inflammation (Choices A and E).

Â¢ Brown or black, flared areas along the border are due to advancing, neoplastic
melanocytes (Choice C).

e White and gray areas appear when cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize tumor antigens
(eg, melan-A) and induce apoptosis, leading to malignant melanocyte regression
(cleared patches).

Melanocyte regression is also a hallmark of treatment response to melanoma
immunotherapies, such as the programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor
pembrolizumab.
