(Choice A) Chronic systolic heart failure can sometimes be associated with cough and fatigue
due to pulmonary congestion. Although brown, hemosiderin-laden macrophages can be seen,
atypical cells (eg, binucleated, enlarged nuclei) and hilar lymphadenopathy would not be
present.

(Choice B) This patient is at risk for emphysema due to his long smoking history. Although
emphysema often causes dyspnea and cough, biopsy would show airspace enlargement and
destruction of alveolar walls.

(Choice C) Hodgkin lymphoma frequently presents with diffuse lymphadenopathy or
pulmonary symptoms (eg, cough) related to a mediastinal mass. However, biopsy would show
malignant Reed-Sternberg cells amidst an inflammatory infiltrate (not cells with dark pigment).

(Choice E) Sarcoidosis frequently causes pulmonary symptoms and fatigue and often
presents with hilar lymphadenopathy and reticular pulmonary infiltrates. However, biopsy
would show noncaseating granulomas, not pigmented, atypical cells.

(Choice F) Squamous cell lung cancer frequently presents with cough and fatigue. Although
atypical cells would be seen on biopsy, keratin (not brown pigment) would be present.
