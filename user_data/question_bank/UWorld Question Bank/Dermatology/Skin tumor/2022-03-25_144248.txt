This patient's small, bright-red, papular lesions are cherry hemangiomas, also known as
cherry angiomas or senile hemangiomas. They are the most common benign vascular
tumors in adults and typically appear during the third or fourth decade of life. The lesions do
not regress spontaneously and often multiply with age. Cherry hemangiomas are always
superficial on the skin and are not found on the mucosa or deep tissues. Histologically, they
appear as sharply circumscribed areas of congested capillaries and post-capillary venules in
the papillary dermis.

(Choice A) Acrochordons (skin tags) are pedunculated outgrowths of normal skin. They are
typically seen in areas of friction (eg, neck, axilla, inframammary, groin) of patients with obesity
and diabetes mellitus.

(Choice B) Cavernous hemangiomas consist of dilated vascular spaces with thin-walled
endothelial cells. They present as soft blue, compressible masses up to a few centimeters in
size. They may appear on the skin, mucosa, deep tissues, and viscera. When cavernous
hemangiomas appear on the skin, they are most frequently based in the dermis.

(Choice D) Cystic hygromas are comprised of lymphatic cysts lined by a thin endothelium.

posterior neck and lateral chest wall. Cystic hygromas are frequently found in neonates with
