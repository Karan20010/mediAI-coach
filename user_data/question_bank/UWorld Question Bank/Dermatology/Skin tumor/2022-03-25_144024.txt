A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with new-onset tonic-clonic
seizures. His past medical history is unremarkable. The patient recently has had right-sided
headaches and has taken acetaminophen with some relief. MRI of the brain reveals several
round lesions in the right temporal lobe. After initial evaluation, a stereotactic biopsy of one of
the lesions is performed. The biopsy results show neoplastic tissue containing a mutation in
the gene that encodes BRAF, a protein kinase. The point mutation results in a valine >
glutamic acid substitution at position 600 of the protein. Which of the following is the most
likely diagnosis?

A. Glioblastoma (10%)
YB. Melanoma (69%)
