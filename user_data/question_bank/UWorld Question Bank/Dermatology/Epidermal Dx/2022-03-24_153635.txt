Question Id: 1725

A 32-year-old woman comes to the office due to worry that she will go bald. Her father had a
receding hairline with apical baldness beginning at age 20 and was completely bald by age
35. The patient's paternal grandmother and multiple other relatives on her paternal side also
had early-onset baldness, but her father's siblings and the maternal side of her family have
had no problems with unusual hair loss. Physical examination shows mild thinning of hair at
the temporal areas, with an otherwise normal hairline, thickness, and coloration. There is no
excess hair growth on her face or trunk, and she has a normal female pattern of pubic hair
growth. Palpation of the thyroid is normal. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance
pattern of the hair loss in this patient's family?

A. Autosomal dominant (19%)

B. Autosomal recessive (23%)

C. Mitochondrial (7%)
YD. Polygenic (45%)

E. Sporadic (4%)
