Educational objective:

Late-stage radiation dermatitis occurs months to years after radiation exposure and is
characterized grossly by pigment changes, telangiectasias, and chronic ulceration. Typical
histologic changes include vascular abnormalities, fibroblast proliferation, and homogenization
of dermal collagen (ie, fibrosis) due to the increased expression of transforming growth factor-

beta.
