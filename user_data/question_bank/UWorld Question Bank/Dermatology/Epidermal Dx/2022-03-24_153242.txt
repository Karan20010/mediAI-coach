This patient has a persistent, itchy, ulcerating skin lesion with hypopigmentation and
telangiectasias at a site of prior radiotherapy, consistent with late-stage radiation
dermatitis. Radiotherapy can be used with excision in the treatment of high-risk, invasive skin
cancer to kill remaining cancer cells and decrease recurrence risk. lonizing radiation causes
apoptosis of rapidly dividing cancer cells directly by inducing DNA damage and indirectly by
generating free radicals.
