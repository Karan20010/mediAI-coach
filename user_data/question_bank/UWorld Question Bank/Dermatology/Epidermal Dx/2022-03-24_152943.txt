This college athlete's rapidly worsening acne despite the previously effective use of topical
agents raises concern for androgenic steroid supplementation. Androgens (eg,
dehydroepiandrosterone, testosterone) are produced predominantly by the adrenal glands and
gonads; they may also be supplemented exogenously. They bind to receptors in cytosol,
translocate into the nucleus, and alter gene expression. In the skin, this results in

increased sebum production by sebaceous glands and follicular epidermal
hyperproliferation, which promote acne formation.

The role that androgens play in acne pathogenesis is clearly demonstrated in the prepubertal
and pubertal years, when a rise in adrenal and gonadal androgens coincides with acne
formation. Hirsute women with pathologic hyperandrogenic states (eg, polycystic ovary
syndrome) also frequently have coexisting acne. When acne suddenly becomes severe (eg,
nodulocystic acne, acne fulminans), androgenic steroid supplementation should be considered
as a possible cause, especially in athletes.
