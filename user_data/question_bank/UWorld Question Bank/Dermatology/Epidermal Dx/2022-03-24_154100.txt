Educational objective:

Acne is characterized by the obstruction of pilosebaceous follicles (ie, comedones) due to
hyperkeratinization and excessive sebum accumulation. Androgens stimulate production of
sebum, which serves as a nutrient source for Cutibacterium acnes. Within the follicles, C
acnes proliferation triggers an inflammatory response, resulting in formation of red papules
and pustules.
