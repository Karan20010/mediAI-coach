(Choice A) High ambient temperatures can worsen acne, leading to formation of painful
nodules on the trunk (tropical acne). Colder temperatures are not associated with acne.

(Choice B) Exposure to water contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause
erythematous papules and pustules around hair follicles (hot-tub folliculitis). This condition
begins acutely, resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, and typically involves the skin under
a bathing suit (eg, buttocks) or on the extremities.

(Choice C) Obesity is associated with an increased risk of acne, but weight loss generally
does not worsen acne.

(Choice D) Typical oral contraceptives do not promote acne. Rather, many commonly used
contraceptives can reduce acne due to decreased synthesis of androgens.
