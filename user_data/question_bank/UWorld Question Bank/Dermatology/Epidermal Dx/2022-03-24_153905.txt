Androgenetic alopecia causes hair loss primarily at the anterior scalp and vertex. It shows
polygenic inheritance, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) being the primary pathogenic factor.
Five-alpha reductase inhibitors decrease the conversion of testosterone to DHT and are
effective for treating the condition.
