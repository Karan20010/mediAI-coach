This patient has diffuse dermal scaling consistent with ichthyosis vulgaris, an inherited
disorder caused by mutations of the filaggrin gene. This results in epidermal hyperplasia and
defective keratinocyte desquamation, leading to the accumulation of dry, scaly skin with
loss of normal barrier function. Filaggrin mutations are also seen in atopic eczema, and
ichthyosis vulgaris is frequently associated with a family history of eczema and other atopic
disorders (eg, asthma, seasonal allergies).

Ichthyosis vulgaris typically affects the trunk and extensor surfaces of the extremities
(particularly the legs), with sparing of the flexures and face. Palmar hyperlinearity is also
common. The symptoms first appear in childhood but may worsen with age, as well as in the
winter because of decreased ambient humidity; mild symptoms may be misdiagnosed as
simple xerosis (ie, dry skin).
