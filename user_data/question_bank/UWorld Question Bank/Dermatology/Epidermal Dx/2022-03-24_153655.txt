The most common type of hair loss in males and females is androgenetic alopecia (male
pattern baldness). As the name implies, the hair loss is driven by both hormonal (eg,
circulating androgens) and genetic factors. The hair loss occurs primarily at the temporal
areas and vertex and progresses through life. The pattern and severity vary between males

and females.

Androgenetic alopecia demonstrates polygenic inheritance with variable expressivity. Key
sites of genetic influence have been identified on the short arm of chromosome 20, and also
on the X and possibly Y chromosomes. Therefore, some of the genetic factors may be
transmitted with X-linked recessive inheritance (eg, gene variations in the androgen receptor),
whereas others will show autosomal dominant inheritance (Choice A).
