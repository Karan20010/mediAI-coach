(Choices A and C) Dairy consumption (particularly skim milk) and a high-glycemic-index diet
are associated with acne. Natural hormones in milk and increased levels of insulin-like growth
factor may play a role.

(Choice B) Chlorine has antibacterial effects against Cutibacterium acnes, the bacteria which
promotes inflammation in acne. Regular exposure to chlorinated water may improve acne.

(Choice E) Ultraviolet radiation can cause sunburn or precipitate photodermatoses, such as
the malar rash seen in systemic lupus erythematosus or drug-induced photosensitivity (eg,
tetracyclines, sulfonamides). However, ultraviolet radiation would not suddenly cause severe

acne.
