(Choice A) It was once thought that HS is a suppurative disease involving the apocrine, not
the eccrine, sweat glands. However, current understanding supports follicular occlusion as the
cause.

(Choice B) Colonization of hair follicles by Cutibacterium acnes triggers the inflammatory
response seen in acne vulgaris, which typically begins in adolescence and primarily affects the
face, chest, and upper back. In contrast, HS involves the intertriginous regions, with
symptoms usually beginning after age 18. Early HS lesions are typically sterile but later
become colonized or infected with gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria.

(Choice C) Squamous cell carcinoma can occasionally arise in areas affected by HS due to
chronic inflammation. However, it typically presents as a well-demarcated, scaly papule or
plaque, features absent in this patient's lesion.
