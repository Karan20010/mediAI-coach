(Choice B) Lentigines are small, benign pigmented lesions characterized by linear
melanocytic hyperplasia.

melanocyte cytoplasm. These macules are hyperpigmented and associated with
neurofibromatosis type 1.

(Choice D) Postinflammatory hypopigmentation can occur after significant inflammatory skin
lesions (eg, discoid lupus, psoriasis) and is characterized by redistribution of existing melanin
within the skin and/or reduced transfer of melanin to keratinocytes.

(Choice E) Individuals with albinism have melanocytes that do not produce melanin because
of absent or defective tyrosinase.
