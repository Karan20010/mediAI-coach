(Choice A) Full-thickness epidermal necrosis with subepidermal bullae is characteristic of
Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis. This systemic immune reaction to
certain medications (eg, allopurinol, carbamazepine, sulfonamides) results in fever, skin
tenderness, desquamation, and widespread blistering.

(Choice C) Neutrophilic infiltrates and elongation of dermal papillae are characteristic of
psoriasis vulgaris, which typically causes symmetric, salmon-colored scaly plaques with
sharply defined borders.

(Choice D) During an urticarial reaction, mast cells release inflammatory mediators and
cytokines (eg, IL-5) that can recruit eosinophils, resulting in perivascular collections of
eosinophils in and around the urticarial lesion. Urticaria usually manifests as pruritic,
erythematous plaques (ie, wheal and flare reaction).
