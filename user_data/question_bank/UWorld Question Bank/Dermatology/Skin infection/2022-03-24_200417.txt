This patient, who developed a serpiginous, pruritic rash shortly after walking barefoot on a
beach, likely has hookworm infection. Hookworms spread when egg-containing feces are
deposited into shady, warm, moist sand or soil. Eggs hatch into larvae and are transmitted
when they come into direct contact with human skin (eg, when walking barefoot).

Dermal penetration is usually marked by a pruritic maculopapular lesion ("ground itch") at
the site of larval entry (eg, foot, toe webs). Spread of larvae through the adjacent dermal
tissue can lead to the formation of migrating, reddish-brown, serpiginous tracks. Deeper
spread may occur, depending on the species of infecting hookworm, as follows:
