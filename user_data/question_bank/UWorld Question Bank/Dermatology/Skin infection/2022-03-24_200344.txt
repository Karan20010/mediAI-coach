populations).

(Choice A) Cimex /ectularius (ie, bedbugs) bites present as pruritic, red papules in clusters.
The females lay eggs away from the host and do not produce nits.

(Choice B) Colonization with Malassezia yeasts is associated with seborrheic dermatitis. On
the scalp, this condition can produce white skin flakes in the hair (ie, dandruff). The flakes are
not adherent to the hair shaft and are typically found loosely throughout the hair and on the
clothing.

(Choice D) Pthirus pubis (ie, crab louse, pubic louse) is usually transmitted by sexual
contact. The louse is adapted for attaching to thick hair shafts, and the nits are usually found
on pubic and other thick hair (eg, eyelashes); however, scalp hair is not typically affected.

(Choice E) Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies, which presents with pruritic papules and
burrows on the interdigital and flexural skin of the extremities. The female mite lays eggs in
burrows and does not form nits.

(Choice F) Trichophyton tonsurans is a dermatophyte that causes tinea capitis, which
presents as a scaly, erythematous patch of hair loss. There are often small, black dots that
represent broken hair shafts.
