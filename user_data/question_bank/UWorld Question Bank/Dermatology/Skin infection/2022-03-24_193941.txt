This patient's vesicular rash on the buccal mucosa, tongue, and distal extremities likely
indicates hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), a common childhood illness caused by
species of enterovirus (eg, Coxsackievirus). Transmission largely occurs via the fecal-oral
route, and outbreaks are common in day cares and elementary schools.

The virus initially replicates in gastrointestinal lymphatic tissue and subsequently
disseminates through the reticuloendothelial system and bloodstream to other organs (eg,
heart, liver, brain, skin). Patients generally develop low-grade fever and the following
mucocutaneous findings:

¢ Oral enanthem — painful, erythematous vesicles and ulcers on the tongue and buccal
mucosa, which may lead to refusal to eat or drink

¢ Skin exanthem — maculopapular or vesicular lesions on the hands, feet, and extremities

Most cases can be managed with supportive care and resolve spontaneously within a week.
However, viral shedding in the stool continues for >6 weeks, which can propagate
transmission.
