6 (Choice A) Primary VZV infection is characterized by a diffuse vesicular rash (chickenpox),

° occur in immune-compromised patients but is extremely rare in healthy individuals.

(Choice B) Reactive arthritis presents with an asymmetric peripheral oligoarthritis, often with

extraarticular symptoms (eg, uveitis, conjunctivitis, urethritis). It typically follows bacterial
gastrointestinal (eg, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter) or genitourinary (eg, Chlamydia)
infection.

(Choice D) IgA nephropathy produces recurrent glomerulonephritis and typically presents with
episodic hematuria. Common triggers include upper respiratory illness, but shingles does not
typically exacerbate the condition.

(Choice E) Toxic or metabolic nerve injury (eg, diabetic peripheral neuropathy) is typically
proportionate to the length of the sensory nerve fibers. Symptoms appear first in the longest
nerves, such as those to the feet and hands, causing a "glove and stocking" distribution.
However, because reactivation of VZV occurs only in specific sensory ganglia, symptoms have
a dermatomal distribution.
