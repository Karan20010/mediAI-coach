mucosal or lymphatic Leishmania infections can also occur.

(Choice B) Yaws, a spirochetal infection caused by Treponema pallidium subspecies, is
transmitted by skin-to-skin (nonsexual) contact and is seen in Central America. Patients
typically develop a painless papule that eventually ulcerates (similar to syphilitic chancre).
However, this organism is a bacterium, not a protozoan.

(Choice C) Sporothrix schenckii, a dimorphic fungus, grows in decaying plant matter and is
transmitted to humans via subcutaneous inoculation. Manifestations include a papule at the
site of inoculation and subsequent papules along proximal lymphatic drainage pathways.
Histopathology demonstrates granulomas and cigar-shaped, budding fungus.

(Choice D) Bacillus anthracis, a gram-positive bacterial infection, is often transmitted to
humans due to cutaneous contact with infected animals or animal hides. Manifestations
include a painless cutaneous papule that evolves over days into an ulcer with a black eschar.
Histopathology would show extracellular, gram-positive rods.

(Choice E) Mycobacterium marinum, an acid-fast bacterium, causes cutaneous infection after
exposure to contaminated water (eg, fish tank). Patients typically develop a papule that
ulcerates and scars. However, histopathology would not show intracellular protozoa.
