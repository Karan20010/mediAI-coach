¢ Tuberculoid leprosy (TT) (seen in this patient) is the least severe form and is often self-
limited. Mycobacterial infection is limited by an intact CMI response (Th1-mediated). Mild
skin plaques develop and are associated with hypopigmentation, hair follicle loss, and
focally decreased sensation.

¢ Lepromatous leprosy (LL), the most severe form, occurs in patients with a weak CMI
response (Th2-mediated). Macrophage signaling to kill / leprae is limited, leading to
mycobacterial dissemination. Manifestations include diffuse skin thickening, plaque-like
hypopigmentation (often with hair loss), leonine facies, paresis, regional anesthesia,
testicular destruction, and blindness.

M leprae grows best at temperatures below core body temperature, partially explaining why
leprosy manifests in the skin, superficial nerves (eg, Schwann cells in this patient), eyes, and
testes. Intermediate features between TT and LL are often seen.
