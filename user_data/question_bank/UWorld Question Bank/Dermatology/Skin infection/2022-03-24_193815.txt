(Choice A) Oral acyclovir is used for human herpes simplex virus outbreaks, which are
usually characterized by vesicular lesions on an erythematous base. The orolabial mucosa
and genital area are affected most commonly. Histopathology would show epidermal blisters
with acantholysis and multinucleated cells.

(Choice B) Oral terbinafine can be used for patients with dermatophytic infections of the skin.
Dermatophytes often cause an erythematous scaly rash and erosions. Microscopy typically
reveals fungal spores and/or hyphae.

(Choice C) Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can be treated with topical
glucocorticoids. It is usually associated with symmetric, sharply defined skin plaques with
overlying scales on the extensor elbows, knees, and scalp. Microscopy generally shows
uniform epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, dilated capillaries in the papillary dermis, and
perivascular lymphocytes.

(Choice D) Topical mupirocin is used for the treatment of impetigo, a superficial bacterial
infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The condition
typically presents as a localized papulovesicular rash with surrounding erythema and adherent
golden crusts involving the face or extremities.
