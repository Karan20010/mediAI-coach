Classic scabies is associated with a mild mite burden (10-15 mites). Patients usually have
several small erythematous papules on the sides/webs of the fingers, wrists, elbows, axillae,
waist, and genitalia. Excoriations and burrows (thin, serpiginous red tracks) may be seen.
In contrast, patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are unable to contain the
infection and usually develop crusted scabies, which is associated with thousands or millions
of mites. These patients often have mild pruritis (because the inflammatory response is
muted) and several erythematous patches with scaling and crusting.

Treatment is required to prevent discomfort, transmission, and potential complications (eg,
secondary bacterial infection). First-line therapy includes topical permethrin, which blocks
mite neurotransmission by impairing voltage-gated sodium channels. Oral ivermectin, an
antiparasitic agent that binds chloride ion channels in invertebrate nerve and muscle cells, is
an alternate medication for classic scabies that is used in combination with permethrin for
crusted scabies.
