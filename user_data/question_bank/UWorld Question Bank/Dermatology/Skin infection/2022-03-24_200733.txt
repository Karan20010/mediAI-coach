Leprosy is a chronic, slowly progressive, communicable disease caused by Mycobacterium
leprae that typically involves the skin and peripheral nerves. Clinical manifestations are widely
variable depending on the strength of the T,1 cell-mediated immune response to the
organism. Disease is classified along a spectrum between tuberculoid (mild) to lepromatous
(severe) forms. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop a strong T,,1-mediated response
(interleukin [IL]-2, IFN-y, and IL-12) in affected tissues, leading to the activation of
macrophages that kill M leprae organisms, thereby limiting disease extent. However, this
localized inflammation damages the skin and cutaneous nerves, leading to the development of
a small number of hypopigmented, well-demarcated plaques with decreased sensation.

Lepromatous leprosy is a more disseminated form of the disease characterized by an innate
inability to recognize and mount a cellular immune response against M leprae antigens.
Affected tissues show extensive accumulation of acid-fast bacilli within macrophages and often
a T,2 cytokine profile (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10). Patients with lepromatous leprosy develop more
numerous, poorly demarcated plaques that are widespread across the body. Over time, the
bacterial load increases and the nodular lesions coalesce, causing the development of leonine
facies and degeneration and loss of the nose and digits.
