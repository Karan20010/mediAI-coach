Educational objective:

Hookworm infections are transmitted via direct contact between human skin and contaminated
soil/sand (eg, walking barefoot). Dermal penetration is often characterized by an intensely
pruritic papule that may form serpiginous tracks due to the subcutaneous migration of
hookworm larvae.
