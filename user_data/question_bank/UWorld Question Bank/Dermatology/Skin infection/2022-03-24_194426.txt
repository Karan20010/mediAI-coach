Imiquimod is a topical immunomodulatory drug that is used to treat many common
dermatologic disorders associated with abnormal cell proliferation, including anogenital warts
(ie, human papillomavirus infection), superficial basal cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis.
The antiviral and antiproliferative effects of imiquimod are primarily mediated through
activation of toll-like receptor 7, which upregulates the proinflammatory transcription factor
nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB).

NF-kB increases transcription of proinflammatory genes, activating antigen-presenting cells
(eg, Langerhans cells in the skin) and initiating an immune response involving natural killer
cells, cytotoxic T cells, and type 1 helper T cells. This results in increased cytokine
production (eg, IL-1, IL-12, interferon-alfa/gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and
enhanced immune-mediated killing of aberrant cells (eg, cancer cells, virus-infected cells).

Other antiproliferative effects of imiquimod include:

¢ Induction of apoptosis of aberrant cells through caspase activation via inhibition of BCL-
2

¢ Inhibition of angiogenesis by downregulating proangiogenic factors (eg, fibroblast
growth factor) and upregulating angiogenesis inhibitors (eg, interferon-gamma, IL-12)
