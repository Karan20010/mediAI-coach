(Choice A) Coxsackievirus is the most common etiologic agent in hand-foot-and-mouth
disease, which is characterized by low-grade fever and vesicles/ulcers on the oral mucosa and
skin (especially hands and feet). Chronic papules are more consistent with cutaneous warts.

(Choice B) Herpes simplex virus causes herpetic whitlow, which presents acutely with a
prodrome of burning/tingling followed by single or multiple vesicles on an erythematous base.

(Choice D) Disseminated gonococcal infection causes a pustular or bullous rash, which
commonly involves both the extremities and torso. It is typically associated with tenosynovitis
and migratory polyarthralgia.

(Choice E) Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a pox virus. Although it commonly presents
as small papules, the lesions are smooth, pearly, and umbilicated, unlike the rough, dry lesions
in this patient.

(Choice F) Condyloma lata is a manifestation of secondary syphilis, caused by Treponema
pallidum. Although it may present as verruciform lesions, it is often associated with fever and
lymphadenopathy and is most common on the oral mucosa or genital area near the site of

primary infection.
