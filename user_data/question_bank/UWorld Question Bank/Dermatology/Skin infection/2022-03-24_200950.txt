This patient, with a mildly pruritic, polycyclic rash with a raised, scaly border and central
clearing, has tinea corporis. Patches of tinea corporis are typically round or ovoid but may
become confluent to form a "flower petal" shape. Skin contact, especially in warm and humid
environments, is a common risk factor, and patients often have concurrent infections in other
body areas. Any species of dermatophyte may cause this condition, but Trichophyton rubrum
is the most frequent culprit.

Dermatophyte infections (eg, tinea corporis, tinea pedis, tinea cruris) infect keratinized
matter in the stratum corneum of the superficial epidermis but do not invade the dermis and
subcutaneous tissues. The diagnosis is confirmed with potassium hydroxide (KOH)
preparation of skin scrapings, which can show the characteristic segmented hyphae and
arthrospores.
