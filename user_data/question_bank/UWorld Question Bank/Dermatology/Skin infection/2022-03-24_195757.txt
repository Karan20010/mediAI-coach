Educational objective:

Pityriasis versicolor (tinea versicolor) is a superficial skin infection caused by Malassezia
species. It causes erythematous, hyper- or hypopigmented macules and patches. Malassezia
forms spores and hyphae, producing the characteristic "spaghetti and meatballs" appearance

on KOH preparation light microscopy.
