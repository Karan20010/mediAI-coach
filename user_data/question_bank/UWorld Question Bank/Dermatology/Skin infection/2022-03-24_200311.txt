This patient has numerous nits, which are egg casings of the head louse Pediculus humanus
capitis. Pediculosis capitis (ie, head lice infestation) is common in school children and adults
who come into close contact with infested individuals (eg, sports teams, homeless shelters).
Transmission is usually by direct contact, although transmission by fomites (eg, hats,
hairbrushes) can also occur. Head lice require multiple blood meals a day and die within 2
days if separated from a host. They do not carry arthropod-borne infection, but the bite can
induce a pruritic allergic reaction.

Female lice attach their nits to the hair shaft about 0.5 cm from the skin surface; nits further
from the surface often represent old egg casings that have hatched and generally do not
require treatment. First-line treatment includes topical pediculicides (eg, permethrin,
ivermectin). Manual lice removal via wet combing is an alternate treatment for patients for
whom standard pediculicides are not feasible (eg, children age <2 years, resource-poor
populations).
