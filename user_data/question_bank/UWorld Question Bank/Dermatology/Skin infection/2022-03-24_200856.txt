Microscopy of this patient's skin lesion revealed intracellular protozoa with rod-shaped
kinetoplasts, raising strong suspicion for cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease
endemic to the Middle East and Central and South America. Leishmania species are harbored
by small mammals and transmitted to humans via bites from infected sand flies. The
parasite subsequently matures within mammalian macrophages and can be visualized on
biopsy as intracellular, round-oval amastigotes with rod-shaped kinetoplasts (see arrow).

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is characterized by a chronic, enlarging, pinkish papule at the site
of the bite that eventually develops into a nodule or plaque and ulcerates. Most cases occur
on exposed areas of skin because sand fly bites cannot penetrate clothing. More serious
mucosal or lymphatic Leishmania infections can also occur.
