(Choice A) Patients with lepromatous leprosy have a high bacterial load with widespread
involvement throughout the peripheral (cooler) tissues of the body. As a result, intermittent
bacteremia often occurs in the later stages of the disease. However, this patient's few lesions
and positive lepromin skin test are more indicative of tuberculoid leprosy, which has a very low
bacterial load with limited tissue involvement.

(Choice B) High serum antimycobacterial antibody levels are more frequently seen in
lepromatous leprosy than tuberculous leprosy. Because M leprae resides mostly within
macrophages, circulating immunoglobulins have little access to the organism and are unable
to bind, opsonize, or fix complement. Humoral immunity does not influence the positivity of the
lepromin skin test.

(Choice C) In lepromatous leprosy, macrophages remain inactivated due to the inability of T,,1
cells to recognize M leprae antigens. This form of leprosy is characterized by a poor cell-
mediated response and diffuse spread of the organism. This patient is presenting with the
tuberculoid form, in which activated macrophages actively kill / /eprae organisms.

(Choice E) Acid-fast bacteria typically do not accumulate in the skin lesions of tuberculoid

leprosy due to the strong cell-mediated response that is effective at eradicating M leprae. In
some instances, this immune response is so effective that tuberculoid leprosy can be self-
