The lepromin skin test (in which M leprae antigens are injected intradermally) can be used to
distinguish between tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy
will develop an indurated nodule at the site of the injection (much like a positive PPD test for M
tuberculosis). In contrast, the test is usually nonreactive in patients with lepromatous leprosy
due to their weak T,,1 cell-mediated immune response.
