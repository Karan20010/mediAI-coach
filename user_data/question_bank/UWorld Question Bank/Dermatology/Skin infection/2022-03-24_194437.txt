Educational objective:

Imiquimod is a widely used topical immunomodulatory agent that stimulates a potent cellular
and cytokine-based immune response to aberrant cells (eg, human papillomavirus-infected
cells in anogenital warts) by activating toll-like receptors and upregulating NF-KB. Other
antiproliferative effects of imiquimod include inhibition of angiogenesis and induction of
apoptosis.
