A 36-year-old man comes to the office to discuss a skin rash on his shoulders and upper
chest. The patient first noticed the rash 2 months ago while vacationing at a beach resort.
The rash has worsened progressively and is associated with mild pruritus, but he has no other
associated symptoms. The patient is a road construction worker, and often works in hot,
humid areas. Past medical history is notable for seasonal allergies and childhood asthma. He
does not use tobacco or alcohol. Skin examination findings are shown in the image below.
