(Choices A and C) Blastomycosis is characterized by progressive pulmonary infection. Skin
involvement is uncommon but can manifest as papular or pustular lesions in exposed areas.
Histoplasmosis also most commonly causes pulmonary disease, though it may become
disseminated in immunodeficient patients.

(Choice B) Intertrigo is characterized by well-defined erythematous plaques with satellite
vesicles or pustules in warm, moist skin areas (eg, axillae, groin, skin folds). The infection is
usually due to Candida species, and it is most common following antibiotic use or in
immunocompromised states (eg, uncontrolled diabetes).

(Choice E) Microsporum species are a frequent cause of tinea capitis and tinea corporis.

(Choice F) Rhizopus is a major cause of mucormycosis, which is characterized by invasive,
necrotic upper and lower respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients.

through breaks in the skin. They cause nodular and ulcerating subcutaneous lesions.
