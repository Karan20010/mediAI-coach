A 28-year-old man comes to the office due to a rash on the lower extremity. The patient
noticed a pruritic papule on the dorsum of his right foot just prior to returning from a south
Florida beach 2 days ago. He walked barefoot on the beach but does not recall any trauma.
Since his return home, the rash and itching have progressively worsened. The patient has no
other medical problems and takes no medications. Physical examination findings are shown
12 below.
