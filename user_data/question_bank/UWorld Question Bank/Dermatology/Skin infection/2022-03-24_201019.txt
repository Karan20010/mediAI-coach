Educational objective:

Tinea corporis presents with round or ovoid lesions with a raised, scaly border and central
clearing. Trichophyton rubrum is the most common cause and infects keratinized matter in the
stratum corneum of the superficial epidermis but does not invade the dermis and

subcutaneous tissues.
