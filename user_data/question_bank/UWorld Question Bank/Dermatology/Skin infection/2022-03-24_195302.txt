This patient's presentation â€” rapidly spreading, pruritic rash with erythematous papules and
excoriations on the extremities - suggests scabies. Scabies is due to infestation by the
Sarcoptes scabiei mite, which burrows into the skin and spreads through direct person-to-
person contact. It usually presents with an intensely pruritic rash in the flexor surfaces of
the wrist, lateral surfaces of the fingers, and the finger webs. The pruritus is often worse at
night and is due to a delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mite, mite feces, and mite
eggs. Scabies can also involve other parts of the body (eg, elbow extensor surfaces, axillary
folds).

Skin examination usually shows excoriations with small, crusted, red papules scattered
around the region. Patients can also develop small vesicles, pustules, or wheals. Linear
burrows are the most specific finding in scabies, although they are often obscured by
excoriations. Diagnosis is confirmed by skin scrapings from excoriated lesions that show
mites, ova, and feces under light microscopy.
