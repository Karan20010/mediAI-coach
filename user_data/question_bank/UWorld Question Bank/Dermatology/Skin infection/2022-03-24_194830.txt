(Choice A) Binding to ergosterol is a mechanism of action of polyene antifungals

(amphotericin B and nystatin).

(Choice C) Caspofungin belongs to the echinocandin class of antifungals. It blocks synthesis
of B (1,3)-D-glucan, a main component of Candida and Aspergillus cell walls.

(Choice D) Griseofulvin binds to polymerized microtubules and disrupts the fungal mitotic
spindle, thus preventing fungal cell mitosis. It accumulates in the skin and its appendages and
is only effective in dermatophytosis.

(Choice E) Flucytosine is an antimetabolite antifungal that is transformed into 5-fluorouracil in
the fungal cell. It inhibits fungal protein synthesis by replacing uracil with 5-fluorouracin in
fungal MRNA. It is used in systemic fungal infections.
