The patient described in this vignette is presenting with symptoms of tinea corporis. Clinically
tinea corporis presents as an annular scaling plaque with well-demarcated, raised

Terbinafine is a commonly used drug for treatment of dermatophytosis. It belongs to the class
of antifungals called allylamines and may be used topically or orally. Terbinafine inhibits
synthesis of ergosterol of the fungal membrane by inhibiting the enzyme squalene epoxidase.
Ergosterol is a cell membrane sterol that is unique to fungi and does not occur in human cell
membranes. This drug tends to accumulate in skin and its appendages, and its side effects
are mild by the topical route.
