Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is an enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus transmitted via
respiratory droplets or direct contact. Initial infection typically occurs in childhood and causes
varicella (chicken pox), which is characterized by fever and a self-limited, diffuse vesicular
rash. VZV then travels via sensory fibers to the dorsal root ganglia (or trigeminal ganglia),
where it remains dormant for years. Weakening of cellular immunity leads to reactivation of
the virus, which manifests as herpes zoster (shingles). Shingles is characterized by unilateral
burning pain and a papular or vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution. The lesions
coalesce, rupture, crust over, and heal within a few weeks although the discomfort may linger
for several weeks.

Light microscopy of a sample from a vesicle base reveals intranuclear inclusions in
keratinocytes and multinucleated giant cells (positive Tzanck smear). Skin biopsy would
show acantholysis (loss of intercellular connections between keratinocytes) and intraepidermal
vesicles.
