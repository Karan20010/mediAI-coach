count and coagulation times (prothrombin and activated thromboplastin times).

(Choice A) Escherichia coli is not associated with EG. E coli is the most common cause of
gram-negative sepsis, usually following urinary tract infections. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome, sometimes seen with Shiga toxin-producing E coli, is
classically associated with renal failure and thrombocytopenia (not seen in this patient).

(Choices B and E) Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza are typically
associated with respiratory infections and can be isolated from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or

respiratory sources. They are not associated with EG.

(Choice C) Klebsiella pneumoniae infection is most commonly associated with necrotizing

pneumonia in elderly or immunocompromised patients.

(Choice F) Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus) frequently causes cutaneous
infections (eg, impetigo, erysipelas) and necrotizing fasciitis, a rapidly progressive deep tissue
infection that spreads contiguously along the muscle fascia. Necrotizing fasciitis initially
appears as a single site of infection with erythema, edema, warmth, and pain out of proportion
to physical findings. This progresses to purpuric discoloration, bullae formation, and sensory

loss due to tissue necrosis.
