Educational objective:

Leishmania species are obligate intracellular protozoa that mature in macrophages and can be
identified on biopsy by the presence of rod-shaped kinetoplasts. They are transmitted to
humans by infected sand flies and cause the clinical syndrome of cutaneous leishmaniasis,
characterized by a chronic, pinkish papule that evolves into a nodule or plaque.
