This patient has cutaneous warts (verruca vulgaris), presenting as painless, skin-colored
papules with a dry, whitish surface. Warts may be single or multiple and can also form
irregular plaques or complex filiform structures. The diagnosis of cutaneous warts is usually
made on inspection, although a magnified view (ie, dermatoscopy) can be helpful and typically
reveals small black dots representing thrombosed capillaries.

Cutaneous warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), which is also the cause of
plantar warts and anogenital warts (ie, condyloma acuminata). Infection is most prevalent in
children, adolescents, and young adults and is usually acquired through direct contact.
Immunosuppressed patients (eg, HIV infection) are at increased risk and often develop
numerous, large lesions.

Although the HPV family is associated with an increased risk for mucosal squamous cell
carcinoma (eg, cervical cancer), this is primarily related to high-risk HPV types (eg, 16, 18);
most cutaneous warts are due to low-risk types (eg, 2, 4), and malignant transformation is
rare.
