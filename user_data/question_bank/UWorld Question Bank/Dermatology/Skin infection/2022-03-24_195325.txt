(Choice A) Budding yeast indicates Candida infection, which most commonly occurs in skin
folds with increased moisture and friction. Risk factors include obesity or conditions that
interfere with the immune system (eg, diabetes, systemic steroids). Candida intertrigo usually
presents with erythematous plaques and erosions with satellite papules or pustules that can
occur in the axillae, genital areas, and other skin folds.

(Choice B) Molluscum bodies indicate molluscum contagiosum, which is caused by a DNA
poxvirus. Patients can develop single or multiple lesions that are smooth, 2-6 mm wide,
whitish or skin-colored, and firm, and appear as pearly papules often with central umbilication.
However, molluscum contagiosum does not typically involve the palms and soles.

(Choice C) Epidermal multinucleated giant cells are seen with herpes simplex and varicella-
zoster virus infections. Herpes simplex typically causes vesicular eruptions involving the
perioral or genital regions, while varicella-zoster causes a diffuse vesicular rash (primary
infection) or more limited dermatomal involvement (eg, shingles). However, this patient's rash
distribution (predominantly palms and axilla) is not characteristic of either virus.

(Choice D) Necrotic keratinocytes in the epidermis suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a
severe reaction that occurs 1-3 weeks after an infection (eg, cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma) or
drug exposure. Patients usually develop high fever, skin pain, mucosal erosions, and skin
