(Choice A) Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by autoantibody-mediated acantholysis,
which leads to the formation of painful mucous membrane and cutaneous erosions. However,

the palms and soles are generally spared and HFMD is far more common in children.

(Choice C) Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity reaction that is typically triggered
by medication (eg, allopurinol) or infection (eg, Mycoplasma). It is characterized by necrosis
and detachment of the epidermis, leading to high fever; hemorrhagic oral erosions; and
coalescing, erythematous skin macules/bullae with purpuric centers.

(Choice D) Scarlet fever is a delayed-type immune response to a pyrogenic exotoxin
produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. Patients usually have a history of streptococcal
infection (eg, pharyngitis, cellulitis) and then develop a diffuse, erythematous, papular rash that
has a "sandpaper" quality. Vesicles are not typically seen, and the oral cavity is not usually
involved.

(Choice E) Kawasaki disease is an inflammatory childhood vasculitis that primarily affects
medium-sized blood vessels. Patients generally have high fever, mucositis (eg, red lips,
strawberry tongue), and a macular or targetoid rash. The presence of vesicles and ulcers
makes this diagnosis unlikely.
