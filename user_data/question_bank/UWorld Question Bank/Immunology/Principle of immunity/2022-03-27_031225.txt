generally cause B cells to overproduce IgM and dramatically underproduce other
immunoglobulin classes (IgA, IgE, IgG). Patients with this disorder (hyper-lIgM syndrome)
generally have significant deficits in both cell-mediated (eg, prevention of Pneumocystis
pneumonia) and humoral (eg, opsonization and destruction of encapsulated bacteria)

immunity.
(Choice A) Certain complement components can reduce the amount of antigen necessary for

B-cell activation by binding CD19 or CD21 on the B-cell surface. This contributes to T-cell-
independent B-cell activation and does not involve CD40L.

(Choice B) Antigen-specific B-cell receptors bind to foreign antigens, the first step in B-cell
activation. CD4O0L plays a role in costimulation of the B cell by binding to CD40; it does not
significantly alter B-cell antigen-receptor binding.

(Choice C) CD18 on neutrophils binds to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on vascular
endothelial cells, allowing the neutrophils to migrate into tissue from the bloodstream.
Leukocyte adhesion deficits are usually triggered by mutations to CD18 and marked by
recurrent infection. They do not involve CD40L.

(Choice D) The Fc receptor (CD16) on phagocytes binds to IgG attached to microorganisms
