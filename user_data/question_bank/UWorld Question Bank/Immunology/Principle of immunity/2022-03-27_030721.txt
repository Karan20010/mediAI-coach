This patient has erythema that blanches without blistering, which is characteristic of a
superficial burn. Burn wounds are classified according to depth based on which layers of
cutaneous and subcutaneous tissues are damaged:

¢ Superficial burns damage only the epidermis.

¢ Superficial partial-thickness burns damage the epidermis and upper dermis.

¢ Deep partial-thickness burns damage the epidermis and most of the dermis.

¢ Full-thickness burns damage the entire dermis and may extend into the fat, muscle, and/or
bone.

The morphologic changes in burns occur due to both direct tissue damage and inflammatory
mediators released from epidermal and immune cells. Release of histamine and other
preformed vasoactive mediators from mast cells in the minutes following a burn leads to
dilation of superficial skin capillaries. This results in blanching erythema (ie, temporary
whitening with pressure due to capillary collapse) that extends to the area surrounding the
initial burn.

Deeper (eg, partial-thickness) burns affect dermal structures such as nerve endings and
venules in addition to the epidermis. Nerve damage can lead to loss of sensation while
damage to venules can result in fluid extravasation through gaps between injured venule
