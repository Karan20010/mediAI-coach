Educational objective:

The Haemophilus influenzae serotype b vaccine consists of a capsular polysaccharide
conjugated to a carrier protein (tetanus toxoid [TT] protein or outer membrane protein [OMP] of
Neisseria meningitidis). Protein conjugation causes a T cell-mediated immune response
leading to long-term immunity through production of memory B-lymphocytes.
