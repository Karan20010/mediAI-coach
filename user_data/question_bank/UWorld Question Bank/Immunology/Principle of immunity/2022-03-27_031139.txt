Negative selection occurs after positive selection and is the process by which T cells
possessing TCRs that bind with high affinity to self antigen or self MHC class | or Il are
eliminated by apoptosis. Negative selection occurs in the thymic medulla and involves
interaction of the developing T cells with thymic medullary epithelial and dendritic cells.
This process serves to eliminate T cells that may be overly autoreactive against self antigens
and therefore may play a role in autoimmunity if not destroyed. This results in a population of
T cells that have only an appropriately low affinity for self MHC molecules.

(Choice A) Affinity maturation is the process of enhancing the hypervariable region antigen
binding affinity that occurs after initial binding of antigen to membrane-bound immunoglobulin
on a naive B lymphocyte and subsequent migration of that B-lymphocyte to a lymph node.
Within the germinal center of the lymph node, affinity maturation is accomplished by the
process of somatic hypermutation where the DNA coding for the immunoglobulin variable
region is mutated randomly at a very high rate. This process results in new immunoglobulins
with similar, better, or worse affinity for the antigen; only B cells expressing antibody with
enhanced affinity for antigen will be selected for. This process does not occur in T-lymphocyte
maturation.

(Choice B) Isotype switching is a process that occurs in naive B-lymphocytes upon initial
