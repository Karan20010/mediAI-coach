This patient has a severe allergic reaction to latex several months after initial sensitization.
During the first encounter with an antigen (allergen), antigen-presenting cells (eg,
macrophages, B cells, and dendritic cells) take up the antigen and display it with MHC class II
molecules. CD4+ T cells are activated when they detect the MHC class Il-associated antigen
and differentiate into either T,,1 or T.2 subsets. T,,2 lymphocytes promote the humoral immune

response by secreting IL-4 and IL-5, cytokines that activate B cells.

IL-4 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of T,0 (naive) T cells into T,.,2
lymphocytes, thus increasing the T,,2 subpopulation and the stimulus for the primary humoral
immune response (eg, IgM). It also induces B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin class
switching to IgE which is responsible for the type | hypersensitivity reaction following
repeated exposure to an allergen. IL-5 contributes to B cell differentiation in addition to its role
in stimulating IgA production and eosinophil activity (eg, host defense against parasitic
infections).

(Choice A) IL-1 is produced by macrophages. It activates naive T,0 lymphocytes and

promotes their differentiation into T,1 and T.2 subpopulations. IL-1 is also an endogenous

pyrogen.
