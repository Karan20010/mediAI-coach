(Choice A) Affinity is the binding strength of the immunoglobulin for a single epitope on the
antigen; the greater the binding strength, the greater the affinity. Each individual type of
immunoglobulin in the polyclonal pool will have the same affinity as the monoclonal version of
the immunoglobulin.

(Choice B) Avidity is the strength of binding between the entire immunoglobulin and the
antigen. Therefore, IgM usually has greater avidity than IgG because IgM binds to up to 10
portions of the antigen while IgG binds to only 2. However, avidity between individual IgG
antibodies in a polyclonal versus monoclonal pool is the same.

(Choice D) Valency is the number of epitope binding sites on each antibody. IgM antibodies
have 10 valence sites, and IgG antibodies have 2. Each monoclonal and polyclonal IgG
antibody has 2 valence sites; valency is no different between these pools.

Educational objective:

Plasma contains polyclonal antibodies, a pool of antibodies that bind different epitopes on an
antigen. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies bind a single epitope on an antigen. Polyclonal
antibodies are often better at neutralizing complex antigens because they contain antibodies
that bind several different epitopes.
