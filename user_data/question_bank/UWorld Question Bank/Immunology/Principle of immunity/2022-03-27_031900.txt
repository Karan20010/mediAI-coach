This patient with recurrent infection is undergoing a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test to
screen for cellular immunodeficiency. This procedure involves intradermal injection of an
antigen to which the patient has already been exposed (ie, Candida extract). Development of
an area of induration (ie, tissue firmness) surrounding the injection site indicates a positive
response and demonstrates effective cellular immunity. Skin testing can also be used as a
control in patients with suspected tuberculosis exposure to ensure that the lack of response is
not caused by anergy.

Contact dermatitis, granulomatous inflammation, and reactive skin testing (eg, tuberculin skin
test, Candida extract skin reaction) are all examples of type IV (T Cell-mediated) delayed-
type hypersensitivity reactions. When reexposed to an antigen, previously sensitized T
lymphocytes proliferate and release inflammatory cytokines that promote cell-mediated
cytotoxicity (CD8- T cells) and/or macrophage recruitment and activation. The resulting tissue

damage and swelling is typically evident 24-48 hours after exposure.
(Choice A) Antibody production by activated B lymphocytes (eg, plasma cells) plays a central

role in type |, Il, and Ill hypersensitivity reactions. The timeframe of these reactions can be
immediate (type I: eg, anaphylaxis, allergies) or variable (types II and III: eg, most autoimmune

disorders, serum sickness).
