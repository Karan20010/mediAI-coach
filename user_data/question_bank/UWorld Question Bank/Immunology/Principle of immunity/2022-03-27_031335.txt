This patient's history of night sweats, weight loss, and cough with the finding of apical
pulmonary granulomas showing caseous necrosis is highly suggestive of active
tuberculosis. The caseating granulomas of tuberculosis consist of large epithelioid
macrophages with pale pink granular cytoplasm surrounding a central region of necrotic
debris. The most specific cell surface marker of the monocyte-macrophage cell lineage is
CD14, which binds to bacterial lipopolysaccharide.

(Choice A) Together with T cell receptors, CD4 transmembrane proteins recognize antigens
presented by MHC Class II molecules. CD4 is expressed on the surface of macrophages but
is also found on T helper cells. Therefore, CD4 is not a specific marker for
monocytes/macrophages.

(Choice B) CD7 is a multi-chain complex T cell marker. It is key to the interaction between T
cells and B cells during lymphoid cell development.

(Choice C) CD8 is a transmembrane protein associated with T cell receptors and found on
the surface of cytotoxic T cells. Together, these proteins recognize antigenic peptides
presented by MHC Class | molecules.

(Choice E) CD20 is aB cell surface marker. Monoclonal antibodies against the CD-20

antigen (Rituximab) have been successful in the treatment of lymphomas.
