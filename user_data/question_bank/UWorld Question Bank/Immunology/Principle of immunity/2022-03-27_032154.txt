¢ B-cell depletion or inhibition: Because B cells generate inflammatory cytokines,
promote T-cell activation, and differentiate into plasma cells that generate autoantibodies,
medications that inhibit B-cell activation (eg, belimumab) or deplete B-cell populations (eg,

rituximab) are highly effective in many systemic inflammatory disorders.

Rituximab is an IgG monoclonal antibody against CD20, a surface molecule present on
developing and mature B cells. Binding of rituximab to CD20 results in Fc receptor-mediated
B-cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent B-cell phagocytosis, which significantly reduces
the B-cell population. Although existing plasma cells are unaffected (they do not express
CD20), the reduction in total B-cell population significantly improves inflammatory symptoms.
However, depletion of B cells also increases the risk for severe and recurrent bacterial
infections, a major adverse effect of therapy.

(Choice C) Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody against integrin, an adhesion molecule that
mediates leukocyte interaction with the endothelium and subsequent leukocyte

attachment/migration into tissue. Natalizumab is used in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.

(Choice D) Cytoplasmic kinases (eg, Janus kinase) transmit inflammatory cytokine receptor
binding to the nucleus. Rituximab does not operate via this mechanism, but new therapies

that target these intracellular signaling pathways are under development.
