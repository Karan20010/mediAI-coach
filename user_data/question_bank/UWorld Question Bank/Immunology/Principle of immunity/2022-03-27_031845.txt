transplant. This type of rejection is generally reversible with increased doses of

immunosuppression.

(Choice C) Degranulation of mast cells and basophils occurs during a type | hypersensitivity
reaction (eg, allergic response), which is not involved in organ transplant rejection.

(Choice D) Graft versus host disease results from donor T lymphocytes activating against
recipient antigens, leading to vasculitis and tissue damage of recipient organs (eg, skin, liver,

gastrointestinal tract).

(Choice E) Atherosclerotic stenosis of the transplanted renal artery can occur over time, but it
would not cause acute graft ischemia with cyanosis and mottling at the time of transplant
surgery.

Educational objective:

Hyperacute rejection is caused by preformed antibodies in the recipient that recognize and
attack donor antigens (ie, type II hypersensitivity). These are often anti-ABO blood group or
anti-HLA antibodies. Vascular injury and capillary thrombotic occlusion lead to rapid ischemic
necrosis of the renal graft, often evidenced by gross cyanosis and mottling immediately

following graft perfusion.
