Polyclonal fab antivenom is a collection of immunoglobulin fragments from the plasma of
venom-inoculated animals (eg, horses). Because the antivenom contains foreign proteins,
exposure triggers the adaptive immune response to form high-affinity IgG antibodies against
the foreign components of the antivenom. This typically takes 1-2 weeks due to time lag
between antigen processing, antigen presentation, CD4 T-lymphocyte activation, and T-cell-
mediated B-cell activation/differentiation.

Once formed, IgG then binds to the free-circulating antivenom, which creates immune
complexes (ICs). The Fc portion of the IgG triggers clearance of the ICs by activating the
classical complement system and by directly binding to the Fc receptor on mononuclear
phagocytes in the reticuloendothelial system. Clearance of ICs generally proceeds without
issue when there is minimal antigen because the phagocytic system has a large capacity.
