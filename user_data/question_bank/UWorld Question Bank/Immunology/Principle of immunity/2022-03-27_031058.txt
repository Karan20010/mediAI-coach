initially diagnosed with relapsing remitting subtype after an episode of visual disturbance and
an episode of paralysis. In her study of autoimmune diseases she encounters the topic of
lymphocyte development and comes across a question which she poses to her neurologist

during a routine follow-up visit: During the process of T-lymphocyte maturation, T cell receptors
of many lymphocytes demonstrate a very high-affinity interaction with MHC molecules
expressed on thymic medullary epithelial and dendritic cells. What process do these
lymphocytes undergo at this time?
