(Choice B) Eosinophils are phagocytic cells that play a role in the defense against parasitic
organisms. These cells are present in small numbers in the bloodstream but are often found in
increased numbers in the affected tissues of patients with type | hypersensitivity responses
(eg, asthma, allergies).

(Choice C) Mast cells are granulocytes that are the primary mediators of type | (immediate)
hypersensitivity reactions (eg, allergies). Sensitized mast cells degranulate and release
inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, prostaglandins) when allergen-specific IgE cross-link
on the mast cell Fc receptors, causing rapid swelling and tissue damage.

(Choice D) Neutrophils are the primary phagocytes of the innate immune system and play an
ancillary role in some hypersensitivity reactions. Neutrophil deficiency or dysfunction can lead
to severe infections without evidence of a significant immune response (eg, pus, infiltrates,
erythema).

Educational objective:

Type IV (delayed) hypersensitivity reactions (eg, Candida extract skin test, contact dermatitis)
are characterized by erythema and induration that develops 24-48 hours after repeat exposure
to an antigen. T lymphocytes mediate the inflammation in these reactions through cytokine

release, CD8- cytotoxicity, and macrophage recruitment.
