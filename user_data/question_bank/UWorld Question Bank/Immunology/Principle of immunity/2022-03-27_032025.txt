An 8-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician with fever, runny nose, and malaise. After
examining the child, the pediatrician determines that he has a viral infection and does not
require any specific treatment. The mother asks why an antibiotic is not necessary, and the
physician explains the differences between bacterial and viral infections. The immune system
is composed of both cellular and humoral components, which are able to mount an effective
response against many types of viral and bacterial infections. A section of a normal lymph
node is shown in the image below.
