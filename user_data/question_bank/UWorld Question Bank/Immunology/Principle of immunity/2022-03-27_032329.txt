Following skin prick testing, this patient developed an erythematous, edematous welt that
was followed 4 hours later by an indurated skin lesion. These findings are consistent with the
early and late phases of a type | hypersensitivity reaction.

After first exposure to an allergen (eg, peanuts), antigen specific IgE is produced by B-cells
and binds to the surface of mast cells. If repeat exposure occurs, the bound IgE can cross-link
and stimulate the release of preformed histamine and leukotrienes that cause vasodilation and
increased capillary permeability. The result is a rapid (eg, minutes after exposure) early-
phase type | hypersensitivity response characterized by superficial dermal edema and
erythema (eg, wheal and flare reaction) that can progress to a more systemic response (eg,
anaphylaxis) (Choice D).

IgE also initiates the late phase of a type | hypersensitivity reaction by stimulating type 2
helper T cells to release cytokines (eg, IL-5) that activate eosinophils. Cationic proteins (eg,
major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase) released from eosinophils cause tissue damage,
which usually manifests as a palpable, indurated lesion 2-10 hours following the early-phase
reaction.

(Choice A) Binding of preformed IgG antibodies to cell surface antigens initiates cell lysis

mediated by complement and/or natural killer cells (type II hypersensitivity reactions). These
