Question Id: 569
This patient is experiencing hyperacute rejection of a renal transplant. Hyperacute rejection
is an antibody-mediated reaction (ie, type Il hypersensitivity) caused by preformed IgG
antibodies in the recipient that are directed against donor antigens. These are commonly
anti-HLA antibodies (eg, formed during prior blood transfusion or pregnancy) or ABO blood

group antibodies.

Hyperacute rejection is usually diagnosed in the operating room when the kidney becomes
cyanotic and mottled after anastomosis of the donor and recipient blood vessels. Perfusion
through the transplanted organ ceases immediately due to antibody- and complement-
mediated vascular injury with subsequent thrombotic occlusion. This rapidly leads to
ischemic necrosis of the glomeruli and renal cortex with little to no urine output and
irreversible graft loss.

To minimize the risk of hyperacute rejection, donor and recipient ABO and HLA cross-matching

is performed prior to renal transplantation.

(Choice A) Activation of recipient T lymphocytes is the primary mechanism of acute organ
transplant rejection. Recipient T cells are sensitized by donor graft antigens, leading to cell-
mediated (ie, type IV hypersensitivity) rejection that typically occurs within 6 months after
transplant. This type of rejection is generally reversible with increased doses of
