is strongly immunogenic in infancy and part of routine childhood vaccinations. Similar to
PPSV23, PCV13 is recommended for immunocompromised patients and adults age >65.

(Choice A) The rate of local site reactions is similar between PCV13 and PPSV23,
approximately 40%-50%. Most local site reactions are minor (eg, transient pain, redness,
swelling).

(Choice C) PPSV23 is a polysaccharide capsular subunit, not a live attenuated vaccine.
Examples of live attenuated vaccines include the rotavirus, varicella, and measles-mumps-
rubella vaccinations.

(Choice D) Both PPSV23 and PCV13 provide strain-specific protection against invasive
disease, including meningitis and sepsis.

Educational objective:

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are strongly immunogenic in infancy due to both B and T
cell recruitment. They provide higher, longer-lasting antibody titers relative to pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccines. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is poorly immunogenic
in infants due to their relatively immature humoral antibody response.
