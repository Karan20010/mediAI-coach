The complement cascade is an ancient proteolytic defense mechanism that plays a major role
in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. It is activated by 3 major inciting events,
all of which terminate in the generation of C3 convertase as follows:

¢ Antibody-antigen binding (classical pathway): The C1 complex (C1q/r/s) forms on the
Fc portion of an IgM or IgG antibody that is bound to an antigen; the C1 complex then
cleaves C4 and C2 into C3 convertase.

¢ Lectin pattern recognition receptor binding (lectin pathway): Host pattern recognition
receptors bind to carbohydrates that are produced only by foreign pathogens; binding

generates proteases that cleave C4 and C2 into C3 convertase without requiring the C1

complex.

¢ C3b binding (alternative pathway): A small amount of autoactivated C3b continually
forms in the intravascular space and is rapidly inactivated by healthy cells. However, the
presence of microbes or damaged cells amplifies the production of C3b, which then
engages with factor B and factor D and generates C3 convertase.

C3 convertase catalyzes the formation of proteins that opsonize pathogens, promote
inflammation, and lead to the generation of membrane attack complexes.
