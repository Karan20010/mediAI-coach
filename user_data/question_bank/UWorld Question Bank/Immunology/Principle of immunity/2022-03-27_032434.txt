(Choices C and E) Formation of Th2 cells is induced by IL-4, which also plays a role in B cell
differentiation and the production of immunoglobulins. Administration of immunoglobulins or
IL-4 would improve the immune response against extracellular bacteria or viruses but would
not be effective in stimulating an immune response against intracellular bacteria such as
mycobacterium.

Educational objective:

IL-12 stimulates the differentiation of naive ThO cells into Th1 cells. Patients with IL-12
receptor deficiency are susceptible to severe mycobacterial infections due to the inability to
mount a strong cell-mediated granulomatous immune response; therefore, they require
treatment with IFN-y.
