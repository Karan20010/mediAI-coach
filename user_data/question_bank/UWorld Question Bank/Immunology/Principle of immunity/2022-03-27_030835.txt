Dendritic cells and macrophages are phagocytic antigen-presenting cells that have an
important role in both the innate and adaptive immune responses. As part of their innate
immune function, they express pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on their surfaces that
recognize 2 major categories of ligands:

Â¢ Damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are intracellular components (proteins,
phospholipids, DNA) released by host cells when they are damaged by inflammation or
infection.

e Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are microbial components conserved
across numerous species that are generally required for microbial survival.

One of the most common PAMPs is lipopolysaccharide, a component of the outer membrane
of all gram-negative bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli). Lipopolysaccharide binds to a type of
PRR called a toll-like receptor, which contains an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a
transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain that conducts transcription signals to the

nucleus via NF-kB.

NF-kB signaling promotes transcription of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-1,
IL-6, IL-12), leading to local inflammation, immune cell recruitment, and systemic effects (eg,

fever, malaise, lethargy, poor feeding). It also stimulates antigen-presenting cells to increase
