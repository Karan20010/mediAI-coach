Eosinophils perform the following functions:

¢ Parasitic defense: Eosinophil proliferation and activation during multicellular parasitic
infection is stimulated by IL-5 produced by T,2 and mast cells (not to be confused with IL-
4, which stimulates IgE production). When a parasite invades the mucosa or enters the
bloodstream, it is coated by IgG and IgA antibodies that bind the Fc receptors located on
the eosinophil cell surface. This triggers eosinophil degranulation and release of cytotoxic
proteins (eg, major basic protein) and reactive oxygen intermediates, substances that
damage and destroy antibody-bound parasites. This mechanism is an example of
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is also used by
macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells.

Type | hypersensitivity reactions: Eosinophils also synthesize prostaglandins,
leukotrienes, and cytokines that contribute to the inflammation seen in late-phase type 1
hypersensitivity and chronic allergic reactions.

(Choice B) Eosinophils contain a diverse number of immunomodulatory cytokines that are

important for directing the T,.2 immune response; but they do not significantly affect B cell

chemotaxis.
