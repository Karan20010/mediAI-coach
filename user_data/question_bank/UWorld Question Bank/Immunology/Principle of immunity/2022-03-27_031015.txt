Exposure to a pathogen or foreign substance (eg, venom) generates innate and adaptive
immune responses. The humoral component of the adaptive immune response culminates
when activated CD4 cells prompt antigen-specific B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation
and class switching, thereby generating a pool of highly specific IgG antibodies that neutralize
several different epitopes on the antigen. This is considered a polyclonal response
because a number of different clonal plasma cells each produce a specific antibody that

targets a different epitope on the antigen.

In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are derived from a single population of plasma cells and
bind only a single epitope on the antigen. Naturally occurring monoclonal antibodies are
typically seen in pathologic conditions such as plasma cell dyscrasias (eg, multiple
myeloma). In the laboratory setting, myeloma cells can be fused to antigen-specific plasma
cells to generate a large amount of monoclonal antibody against a particular antigen.
However, because monoclonal antibodies bind only a single epitope type on an antigen, they
typically generate a less potent immune response than polyclonal antibodies, which bind

multiple different epitope types on an antigen.

(Choice A) Affinity is the binding strength of the immunoglobulin for a single epitope on the
antigen; the greater the binding strength, the greater the affinity. Each individual type of
