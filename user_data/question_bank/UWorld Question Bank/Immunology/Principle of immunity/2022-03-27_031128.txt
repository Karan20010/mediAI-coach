T-lymphocytes, or thymocytes, are initially produced in the bone marrow, but they migrate from
that location to mature during the first trimester of gestation in the thymus. In the thymus, the
processes of T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection,
and expression of extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occurs. Pro-
T cells arrive at the thymus as "double negative" cells — indicating that they lack both CD4 and
CD8 antigens and begin their differentiation in the subcapsular zone. Next, the process of
TCR beta gene rearrangement occurs with simultaneous expression of both CD4 and CD8.
Once in thymic cortex, the alpha genes rearrange to produce a functional alpha-beta TCR.
Subsequently, the processes of positive and negative selection occur with cells that fail either
of these tests being eliminated by apoptosis.

Positive selection is the process by which only T cells expressing a TCR that is able to bind
self MHC are allowed to survive. Those cells expressing a TCR that is not specific for self
MHC are signaled for elimination by apoptosis. This process occurs after TCR DNA
rearrangement and prior to the process of negative selection. It occurs in the thymic cortex
and involves interaction of T cells with thymic cortical epithelial cells expressing self MHC
(Choice D). Positive selection is responsible for development of a T cell repertoire that can
recognize self.
