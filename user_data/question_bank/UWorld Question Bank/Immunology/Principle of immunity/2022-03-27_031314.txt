(Choice C) Complement activation is an important step in antibody-mediated (type II) and
immune complex mediated (type Ill) hypersensitivity reactions. Complement does not play a
prominent role in the destruction of parasites by eosinophils.

(Choice D) Immediate (type |) hypersensitivity reactions are primarily mediated by mast cells
and basophils. These cells possess Fc receptor-bound IgE on their membranes. Eosinophils
contribute to late-phase type 1 hypersensitivity, but this is an allergic response that would not
be protective against schistosomiasis.

(Choice E) Eosinophils can phagocytose parasitic antigens and present them in association
with MHC class II molecules to stimulate helper T lymphocytes. In contrast, MHC class |
antigen processing is involved in inducing a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response against
intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses).

Educational objective:

Eosinophils play a role in host defense during multicellular parasitic infection. When
stimulated by antibodies bound to a parasitic organism, they destroy the parasite via antibody-
dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity with enzymes from their cytoplasmic granules. Another
function of eosinophils is regulation of type | hypersensitivity reactions.
