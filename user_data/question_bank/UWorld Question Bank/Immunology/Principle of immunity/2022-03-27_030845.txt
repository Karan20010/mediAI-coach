fever, malaise, lethargy, poor feeding). It also stimulates antigen-presenting cells to increase
phagocytosis, antigen display, and expression of costimulatory molecules (eg, CD80/86) for T-
and B-cell activation, thereby triggering a strong adaptive immune response.

(Choice A) Beta-2 integrin (CD18) helps leukocytes migrate from the bloodstream to tissue by
binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on the extracellular matrix of the endothelium. It
also helps macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells generate complement receptors,
which recognize and phagocytose foreign peptides.

(Choice B) The Fc receptor (CD16) on phagocytic cells binds to opsonized (eg, IgG-bound)
foreign pathogens, leading to phagocytic destruction. The Fc receptor on natural killer cells
mediates their ability to destroy infected or cancerous cells by antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity.

(Choice C) L selectin (CD62L) is a lymphocyte adhesion molecule that binds to a ligand on
the venule endothelium, which allows lymphocytes to leave the bloodstream and enter
secondary lymphoid tissue.

(Choice D) Major histocompatibility complex class || molecules are on antigen-presenting
cells; they present antigens to the T cell receptor on CD4 cells.
