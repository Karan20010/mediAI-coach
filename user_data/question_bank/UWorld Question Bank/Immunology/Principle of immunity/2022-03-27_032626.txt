result of T cell-dependent stimulation of B lymphocytes and the production of memory B

lymphocytes.
(Choice A) Conjugation does not affect vaccine safety. The main adverse effects of the Hib
vaccine include fever, irritability, and injection site reactions (eg, pain, redness, swelling).

(Choice C) Although conjugation allows for a more robust immune response, a 2- or 3-dose
primary series in infancy followed by a booster dose is still required to achieve protective Hib
antibody levels.

(Choice D) Nontypeable H influenzae represents nonencapsulated strains that generally
cause local disease (eg, sinusitis, otitis media). These bacteria colonize the nasopharynx of
most individuals age >5 years. The Hib vaccine does not confer protection against
nontypeable H influenzae.

(Choice E) Conjugated OMP and TT protein do not elicit protective antibody levels.
Therefore, a patient is not considered to be immunized against the pathogen that the carrier
