When observed in the setting of infection, the combination of hypotension, tachycardia,
tachypnea, and markedly elevated or decreased body temperature is suggestive of septic
shock. Early sepsis is characterized by peripheral vasodilation, a compensatory increase in
cardiac output, and warm extremities.

Numerous cytokines are released in sepsis, resulting in widespread systemic inflammation.
One of the most important mediators of sepsis is tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), an
acute-phase cytokine produced by activated macrophages. TNF-a stimulates systemic
inflammation via recruitment of additional leukocytes (eg, neutrophils, macrophages) and
increasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Other cytokines responsible for inducing the
systemic inflammatory response in sepsis include IL-1 and IL-6.

(Choice A) IL-3 is a cytokine produced by activated T cells. It stimulates the growth and
differentiation of stem cells in the bone marrow.

(Choice B) IL-4 is a cytokine produced by Th2 T-helper cells. It stimulates the growth of B
cells and increases the number of Th2 T-helper cells at the site of inflammation.

(Choice C) IL-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and Th2 T-

helper cells. IL-10 limits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon-gamma,
IL-2, IL-3, TNF-a).
