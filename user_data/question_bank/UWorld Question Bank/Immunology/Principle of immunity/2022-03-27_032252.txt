(Choice D) CD28 is a T cell-specific surface protein that interacts with B7 on antigen-
presenting cells, providing a costimulatory signal necessary for T-cell activation. Therefore,
antibodies blocking CD28 would inhibit T-cell activation. CTLA-4 also binds to B7 but has an
inhibitory function on activated T cells.

Educational objective:

The binding of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) to one of its ligands (programmed
death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) downregulates the immune response by inhibiting cytotoxic T cells.
Many types of cancers evade immunodetection by increasing expression of PD-L1 on their
surface. Monoclonal antibodies against PD-1 upregulate the T-cell response and promote
tumor cell apoptosis.
