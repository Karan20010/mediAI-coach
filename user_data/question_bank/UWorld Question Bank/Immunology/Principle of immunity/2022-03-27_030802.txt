Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of invasive infection (eg, meningitis, sepsis)
in children, particularly those age <2. Routine childhood immunization has dramatically
reduced the incidence of S pneumoniae infection in infancy. Pneumococcal strains are
identified by the polysaccharide components of their capsule. These polysaccharides are

included in vaccines to provide strain-specific immunity.

The 2 types of pneumococcal vaccines are the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines. The
23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, Pneumovax) protects against a
wider range of serotypes (Choice E), but antibody levels decline over approximately 5 years.
In addition, PPSV23 is not immunogenic in children age <2 due to their relatively immature
humoral antibody response. Therefore, PPSV23 is recommended for all adults age >65 and
for those age 2-64 with certain medical conditions (eg, diabetes, chronic pulmonary or

cardiovascular disease).

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13, Prevnar) contains a nontoxic
diphtheria protein conjugated to the polysaccharides that boosts the immune response through
T cell recruitment. This conjugation allows for development of memory B cells, higher and
longer-lasting antibody levels, and less mucosal carriage (herd immunity). Therefore, PCV13
is strongly immunogenic in infancy and part of routine childhood vaccinations. Similar to
