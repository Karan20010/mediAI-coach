Helper T cells that have not yet contacted antigens are called naive (ThO) cells and have T-
cell receptors (TCRs) and CD4 proteins on their surface. An antigen-MHC class II complex
on an antigen-presenting cell (eg, macrophage, dendritic cell) can activate a naive Th cell by
interacting with both TCR and CD4. The activated T cell then differentiates into either a Th1 or
Th2 cell.

If the antigen is presented by a macrophage, the macrophage will produce IL-12, which
stimulates differentiation into Th1 cells. A deficiency of IL-12 receptors on naive T cells
prevents differentiation into Th1 cells, which produce interferon-gamma (IFN-y). IFN-y is
responsible for activation of the macrophage and CD8- cytotoxic response against intracellular
organisms, such as mycobacteria. Therefore, individuals with an IL-12 receptor deficiency
are susceptible to severe, persistent mycobacterial infections. Administration of IFN-y
improves the immune response to mycobacterium in these patients.

(Choices A and B) Both complement and GM-CSF (granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor) play a part in the immune response against pathogens such as
mycobacterium. However, patients with an IL-12 receptor deficiency are unable to produce
sufficient IFN-y and therefore would not be able to mount a sufficient immune response to
mycobacterium without IFN-y supplementation.
