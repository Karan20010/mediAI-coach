cells. It also is a potent chemotactic agent, drawing more neutrophils and monocytes to the
site of inflammation.

(Choice D) Although IgM can be a potent stimulator of C3b opsonization via activation of the
complement cascade, there are no receptors on macrophages for the Fc portion of IgM and it
does not directly enhance phagocytosis (unlike IgG).

(Choice E) Leukotriene B4 is a chemotactic agent that increases the ability of leukocytes to
cross from the serum into the tissues as part of an inflammatory response.

(Choice F) L-selectin is an adhesion molecule that aids entry of lymphocytes from the blood
into lymphoid tissue and margination of neutrophils during inflammatory responses.

Educational objective:

Opsonization occurs when host proteins such as immunoglobulins or complement bind to
foreign cells such as bacteria and coat the surface, enhancing phagocytosis. The most
important opsonins (coating proteins) are immunoglobulin G and complement C3b.
