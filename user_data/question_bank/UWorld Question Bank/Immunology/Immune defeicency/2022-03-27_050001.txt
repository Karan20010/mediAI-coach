for Neisseria meningitidis infection. The virulence of N meningitidis is due to the presence of
a polysaccharide capsule, which allows the organism to evade phagocytosis and
immunoglobulin attachment. Because of these adaptations, initial control of infection is
primarily mediated by activation of the alternative complement cascade, which is triggered
when autoactivated C3 interacts with the surface of the bacteria and amplifies.

Activation of the alternative pathway results in generation of the following:

¢ C3b: a powerful opsonin that binds to complement receptor 1 on erythrocytes and
phagocytes, which increases phagocytosis by reticuloendothelial monocytes

¢ C3a and C5a: potent anaphylatoxins that recruit immune cells and drive a strong
inflammatory response
¢ Membrane attack complexes (MACs): composed of the terminal complement proteins

(C5-9), MACs generate a channel in the bacterial surface, leading to osmotic lysis of the
organism

MACs are the most important initial defense against encapsulated bacteria because they
operate at high efficiency despite the presence of a capsule. Therefore, patients with deficits
