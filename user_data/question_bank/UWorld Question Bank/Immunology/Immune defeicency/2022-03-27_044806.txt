disease (CGD), a condition that results in recurrent bacterial and fungal infections due to
impaired intracellular killing by phagocytes.

CGD is caused by a genetic defect in the NADPH oxidase complex. NADPH oxidase
normally functions to transfer an electron from NADPH to oxygen, resulting in the production of
superoxide (O,-) and other reactive oxygen species such as hydroxyl radicals (HO) and
hydrogen peroxide (H,O,). These oxidants activate granule proteases (eg, elastase,

cathepsin G) that destroy engulfed pathogens and also have direct microbicidal activity.

Most microorganisms produce H,O, as a waste product of metabolism, which can help activate
microbicidal peptides within defective neutrophils in patients with CGD. However, some
pathogens also produce catalase, which can destroy their own metabolically produced H,O..
As a result, the bacteria and fungi responsible for infections in CGD are usually catalase-
positive organisms, particularly the following:

¢ Staphylococcus aureus
¢ Burkholderia cepacia
¢ Serratia marcescens
