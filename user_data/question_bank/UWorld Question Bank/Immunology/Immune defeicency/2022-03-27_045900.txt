Educational objective:

Chronic granulomatous disease is due to NADPH oxidase deficiency, which leads to an
inability of neutrophils to generate a respiratory burst and produce the reactive oxygen species
necessary to kill organisms in their phagolysosomes. Absence of fluorescence on
dihydrorhodamine flow cytometry testing can confirm the diagnosis.
