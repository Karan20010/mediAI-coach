(Choice A) Adenosine deaminase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes
severe combined immunodeficiency. This condition results in a profound decrease in B and T
lymphocytes with variable immunoglobulin deficiencies; DHR testing would be normal.

(Choice B) Cytochrome c oxidase is a multisubunit complex that acts as the terminal enzyme
of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Deficiency results in variable myopathic and
encephalopathic, not infectious, findings.

(Choice C) Lysozyme is an enzyme that helps destroy bacterial cell walls; deficiency
increases the risk of gram-positive infections. However, a defect in lysozyme would not
explain this patient's abnormal DHR testing.

(Choice D) Myeloperoxidase, an enzyme found in neutrophil azurophilic granules, aids in
intracellular killing by catalyzing the production of hypochlorite (bleach) from hydrogen
peroxide and chloride. Although DHR testing can be abnormal in myeloperoxidase deficiency,
patients are usually asymptomatic; a minority have invasive Candida infections. In contrast,
this child's severe bacterial infections (lymphadenitis, abscess, Serratia osteomyelitis) make
this diagnosis unlikely.
