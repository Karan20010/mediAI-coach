This patient likely experienced traumatic splenic rupture 2 years ago with the splenic remnants
removed during laparotomy (spleen is the most commonly injured organ with blunt abdominal
trauma). He subsequently experienced overwhelming asplenic sepsis, a condition that
carries a 50% mortality risk.
The spleen is a part of the systemic lymphoid system and receives roughly 6% of the cardiac
output. Many of the splenic capillaries are open-ended and sinusoidal, permitting whole blood
to flow into the red pulp cords. These cords form a reticular meshwork that acts as a fine sieve
with spaces as small as 1 micron in diameter. Large numbers of macrophages line the red
pulp cords and sinusoids and ingest any particulate matter that becomes trapped. The splenic
red pulp is important for:

1. Destroying aged and abnormal erythrocytes (eg, spherocytes) and serving as an
emergency store of blood cells and platelets that can be delivered into the circulation when
needed.

2. Clearance of circulating bacteria that become lodged in the cords. Macrophages then
present captured antigens to the B- and T-cells residing in the splenic white pulp to

generate an active immune response.
