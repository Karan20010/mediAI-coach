¢ Chronic diarrhea (eg, Giardia lamblia) due to an absence of significant IgA at the mucosal

border

¢ Opportunistic infections (eg, Pneumocystis, Cryptosporidium) due to impaired cell-
mediated immunity from decreased antigen-presenting cell activity (CD40 is also
expressed by antigen-presenting cells and helps to stimulate them)

¢ Minimal lymphoid tissue (eg, lymph nodes, tonsils) due to the impaired formation of
germinal centers.

Recurrent infections often result in failure to thrive.

(Choice B) All 3 complement pathways (alternative, classical, lecithin) converge on C3
convertase, which splices C3 into the anaphylatoxin C3a and the opsonizing protein C3b.
Although the alternative and lecithin pathways are unaffected by hyper-IgM syndrome, the
classical pathway may be mildly impaired because it relies primarily on IgG to serve as a
foundation for the C1 complex. However, complement levels tend to be normal, particularly
when no acute infection present.
