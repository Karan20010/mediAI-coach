cells; however, patients characteristically have progressive ataxia and telangiectasia rather
than eczema.

(Choice C) Patients with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome have coagulation defects and recurrent
pyogenic infections due to the dysfunction of phagocyte phagosome-lysosome fusion.
However, they also typically have oculocutaneous albinism, peripheral neuropathy, and giant
cytoplasmic granules on peripheral blood smear.

(Choice D) DiGeorge syndrome results from maldevelopment of the third and fourth
pharyngeal pouches, which causes hypoplasia of the parathyroid glands and thymus (T cell
deficiency), cardiac and aortic arch abnormalities, and characteristic facies due to
maldevelopment of the mandible.

Shiga toxin—producing Escherichia coli. Patients typically have thrombocytopenia with
