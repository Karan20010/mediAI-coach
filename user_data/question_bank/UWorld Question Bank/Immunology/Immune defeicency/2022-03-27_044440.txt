mucociliary function in the respiratory tract, middle ear, and reproductive organs. Affected
patients have recurrent sinopulmonary infections in childhood and decreased fertility in
adulthood. Viral or opportunistic infections are not seen.

(Choice F) Terminal complement deficiency (any of C5-C9) prevents formation of the
