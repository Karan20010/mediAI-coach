Nearly half of the body's total immunoglobulins are produced by splenic B-lymphocytes.
Splenic opsonizing antibody is of particular importance in the clearance of encapsulated
species, as the capsule allows them to resist innate phagocytosis. Vaccination against
encapsulated bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and
Neisseria meningitidis is recommended for all asplenic patients.

(Choice A) The liver is the primary site for complement production. C3 deficiency
predisposes to recurrent infections with encapsulated organisms. Deficiencies of C5-9, the
components of the membrane attack complex, can lead to recurrent infections with NV
meningitidis or N gonorrhoeae.

(Choice B) Immediate hypersensitivity results from IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation. It
is not affected by splenectomy.

(Choice C) Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a condition where catalase-positive
organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus are phagocytosed but cannot be killed effectively.

Patients experience recurrent suppurative infections (eg, abscesses).

(Choice E) Interferons a and 8 are released from virally-infected cells and cause macrophage

and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation, leading to destruction of infected cells. Defects in type |
