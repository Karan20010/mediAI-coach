Question Id: 561
This patient has manifestations characteristic of severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID). Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is the second most common cause of
SCID, after X-linked SCID (eg, IL-2 receptor mutation). ADA is present throughout the human
body and functions to eliminate excess adenosine from cells by deaminating adenosine to
inosine. Adenosine accumulation is highly toxic to mitotically active cells such as developing
lymphocytes; ADA insufficiency leads to widespread death of both T- and B-lymphocytes with
resultant combined cellular and humoral immunodeficiency. Because both humoral and
cell-mediated immunity are deficient in these patients, they are vulnerable to recurrent, severe
infections by bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

Treatment is with hematopoietic (bone marrow) transplantation, but retroviral gene therapy is
a promising treatment for patients without an HLA match. Retroviral vectors are used to infect
patient hematopoietic stem cells with the genetic code for ADA, resulting in production of ADA
by all daughter cells of that stem cell.

(Choice B) Myeloperoxidase is a neutrophil enzyme that helps kill phagocytosed organisms
by catalyzing the production of hypochlorite (bleach) from hydrogen peroxide and chloride. A
deficiency of this enzyme results in immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent Candida

infections.
