DiGeorge syndrome is caused by maldevelopment of the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch
derivatives. Immunodeficiency can result from thymic aplasia, which leads to an extreme
deficiency in the number of mature T lymphocytes. Although T cells are synthesized in the
bone marrow, they require processing in the thymus in order to mature and mount effective
immune responses. Patients are thus predisposed to recurrent infections by viral, fungal,
protozoan, and intracellular bacterial pathogens.

The paracortex is the region of the lymph node populated primarily by T lymphocytes and
dendritic cells. It lies internal to the cortex, between the follicles and medulla. Dendritic cells
present antigens that they collect from the blood and lymph to the aggregated T lymphocytes
in this region. The paracortex becomes enlarged by the proliferation of T lymphocytes during
adaptive cellular immune responses (eg, viral infections). In DiGeorge syndrome, this region
is poorly developed due to a deficiency of mature T lymphocytes.

(Choice A) Located in the outer cortex, the follicles are sites of B lymphocyte localization and
proliferation. Primary follicles are dense and dormant; secondary follicles have a pale
germinal center containing proliferating B cells and follicular dendritic cells. In
agammaglobulinemia, germinal centers and primary lymphoid follicles do not form due to an
absence of B cells.
