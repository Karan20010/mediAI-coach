(Choice A) An abnormal dihydrorhodamine test indicates an impaired neutrophil respiratory
burst, which occurs in chronic granulomatous disease. Patients have recurrent skin and
pulmonary infections with catalase-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia
marcescens). Severe enteroviral infections are not seen.

(Choice B) Absent peripheral neutrophils, as seen with acquired or congenital neutropenia,
increase the risk of bacterial (eg, Staphylococcus aureus) and fungal (eg, Candida) infections.
Neutrophils have little role in eradicating viruses.

(Choice C) Eosinophils are involved in atopic disease and defense against parasitic
infections. Lack of tissue eosinophils is not associated with severe, chronic viral infections.

(Choice D) Total hemolytic complement (CH50) measures the serum's ability to lyse sheep
erythrocytes coated with IgM antibody. A normal CH50 requires intact activity of all
components of the classical complement pathway (C1-C9). Complement deficiency most
often predisposes to autoimmunity (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) or infection with
encapsulated bacteria (eg, Neisseria).

(Choice F) IgG2 is primarily responsible for opsonization of encapsulated bacteria. IgG2
subclass deficiency typically presents with frequent respiratory infections, not enteroviral
meningitis, and the clinical course is generally less severe than with XLA.
