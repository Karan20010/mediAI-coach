stage. Ovarian teratoma is an ovarian germ cell tumor that can be benign (mature) or
malignant (immature). Soft tissue sarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor that tends to grow slowly
over time. These tumors are not derived from lymphocyte cells and are not generally
responsive to ADA inhibition.

(Choice D) Small cell lung cancer is a fast-growing neuroendocrine tumor that is most
common in smokers. Fast-growing tumors are more likely to express elevated levels of ADA;
however, ADA inhibition is primarily cytotoxic to lymphocyte-derived tumors and has not been
shown to be of significant benefit to other cancer types.

Educational objective:

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibition/absence is highly lymphocytotoxic. Medications that
block ADA are used to treat lymphocyte-derived cancers. Inherited gene mutations in ADA
lead to the autosomal recessive disease of severe combined immunodeficiency.
