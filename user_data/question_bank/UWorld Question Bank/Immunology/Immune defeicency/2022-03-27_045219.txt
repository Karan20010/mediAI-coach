This young patient has multifocal osteomyelitis resistant to treatment, as well as a previous
cutaneous (perianal) abscess. This history of multiple, invasive infections is worrisome for
underlying immunodeficiency. Laboratory results show a normal white blood cell response to
bacterial infection (ie, neutrophilic leukocytosis), but dihydrorhodamine (DHR) testing, which
evaluates for phagocytic oxidative response, is abnormal. These findings are consistent with
chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

CGD is a disorder of phagocytic metabolism characterized by defective NADPH oxidase, an
enzyme in the respiratory burst pathway. Without this enzyme, neutrophils cannot form the
reactive oxygen species required for intracellular killing of phagocytized organisms. Patients
are predisposed to recurrent infections with certain catalase-positive organisms (eg,
Staphylococcus aureus).

The DHR assay detects the conversion of DHR (a colorless substance) to rhodamine
(fluoresces green) by free radicals produced when the NADPH oxidase pathway is stimulated
(eg, by a protein kinase C agonist such as phorbol myristate acetate). In unaffected patients,
stimulated cells show increased intensity of fluorescence (ie, rightward shift along the x-axis),
indicating appropriate NADPH activity, whereas unstimulated cells remain colorless. In
patients with CGD, the stimulated cells show no increased fluorescence (ie, no oxidation of
