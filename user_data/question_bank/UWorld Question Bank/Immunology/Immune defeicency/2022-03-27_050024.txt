Educational objective:

Initial control of encapsulated bacteria is largely reliant on the formation of membrane attack
complexes (MACs) due to activation of the alternative complement cascade. Patients with
deficiency in the proteins that generate MACs (C5-9) are at high risk for recurrent
encapsulated bacterial infection; evaluation will show reduced activity of the classical (CH50)
and alternative (AH50) complement cascades.
