(Choice E) Chronic granulomatous disease is an X-linked immunodeficiency due to impaired
NADPH oxidase, which prevents neutrophils from generating an oxidative burst. Although
recurrent pneumonia is common, meningitis is not. In addition, infections associated with this
defect are caused by certain catalase-positive organisms (eg, staphylococci), not
encapsulated bacteria (eg, N meningitidis).

Educational objective:

Deficiency of the complement factors that form the membrane attack complex (C5-C9) results
in recurrent infections of the lung and meninges by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis).
