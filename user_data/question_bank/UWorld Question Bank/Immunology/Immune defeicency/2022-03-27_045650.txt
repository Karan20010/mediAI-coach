(Choice B) S aureus produces coagulase, which binds to prothrombin and increases
conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Fibrin subsequently coats the exterior of the organism, which
helps it evade phagocytosis. Although patients with CGD are at elevated risk for S aureus,
most of the other common pathogens in CGD do not produce coagulase.

(Choice C) Lecithinase (alpha toxin) is the major virulence factor of Clostridium perfringens; it
causes hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, activating inflammatory pathways that
increase platelet and leukocyte aggregation in the adjacent microvasculature, leading to
vasoocclusion and ischemic necrosis.

(Choice D) Lipopolysaccharide, a major virulence factor in the outer membrane of gram-
negative bacteria, is not present in the gram-positive bacteria (eg, S aureus, Nocardia) and
fungal organisms (eg, Aspergillus) that usually infect patients with CGD.

(Choice E) The polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence factor for Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and certain strains of Haemophilus influenzae. \ts
primary role is to inhibit opsonophagocytosis. The most common pathogens in CGD (eg, S
aureus, Nocardia, Aspergillus) do not contain a polysaccharide capsule.
