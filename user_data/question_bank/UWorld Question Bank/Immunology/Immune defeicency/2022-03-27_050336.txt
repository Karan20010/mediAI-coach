Question Id: 20297

This patient has a severe respiratory infection with Aspergillus fumigatus, an opportunistic,
catalase-positive fungus usually seen in immunocompromised individuals. He also has a
history of recurrent infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, another catalase-positive
organism, as well as normal immunoglobulin levels and an appropriately elevated
leukocyte count in response to infection (ie, no leukopenia). These findings are suggestive of
chronic granulomatous disease (CGD).

CGD is most commonly due to an X-linked recessive mutation affecting NADPH oxidase. This
enzyme is the first step in the respiratory burst pathway, initiating the formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS). In addition to directly damaging phagocytized pathogens, ROS also
activate granule proteases that aid in the destruction of organisms within the phagolysosome.

Without NADPH oxidase, patients with CGD have impaired respiratory burst. Although
protease degranulation occurs normally (Choice A), these enzymes are not activated due to
the absence of ROS, resulting in defective phagocytic intracellular killing. Catalase-
positive bacteria and fungi are most pathogenic in CGD because they can degrade their own
metabolically produced hydrogen peroxide (ie, ROS), further limiting microbicidal protease
activation. Patients commonly develop S aureus abscesses (eg, lymphadenitis) and severe
lung infections, as seen in this patient.
