Genetics ¢ Most commonly due to X-linked recessive CD40L deficiency
¢ Impaired T-cell activation of B cells
© Lack of immunoglobulin class switching
Pathophysiology

© | Memory B-cell production
Impaired T-cell interaction with APCs — lack of germinal centers

Clinical features

Sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal & opportunistic infections
Failure to thrive
Small lymphoid tissue

Diagnosis

t IgM
1 IgG, IgA, IgE
Absent CD40L on CD4* lymphocytes

APCs = antigen-presenting cells; CD40L = CD40 ligand.
