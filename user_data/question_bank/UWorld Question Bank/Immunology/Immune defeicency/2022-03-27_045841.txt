disease (CGD), an X-linked condition caused by NADPH oxidase deficiency. NADPH
oxidase is a membrane-bound complex within phagolysosomes that catalyzes the reduction of

oxygen to superoxide during the respiratory burst. The production of reactive oxygen species

facilitates the intracellular killing of organisms ingested by phagocytes.

Patients with CGD have impaired intracellular killing, resulting in recurrent bacterial and

fungal infections (eg, abscesses, lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis) caused by certain catalase-

positive organisms (eg, Serratia). Diagnostic tests for CGD involve the assessment of

neutrophil superoxide production:

¢ Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) testing assesses the production of superoxide radicals by

measuring the oxidation of DHR to rhodamine, a fluorescent green compound that can be

detected on flow cytometry. An absence of increased fluorescent intensity correlates with

impaired oxidation/respiratory burst and a diagnosis of CGD.

Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) testing involves adding NBT to a sample of the patient's
neutrophils. Properly functioning neutrophils produce reactive oxygen species, which
reduce the pale NBT to dark blue formazan that precipitates within the cells. The
compound has no change in color in patients with CGD.
