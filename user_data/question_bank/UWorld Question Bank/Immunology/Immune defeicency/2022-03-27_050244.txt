This patient with signs of a sinus infection (eg, thick, purulent nasal drainage) has a history of
recurrent skin abscesses and chronic atopic dermatitis. Given her normal platelet count, which
excludes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, her findings are most consistent with hyper-IgE
syndrome (Job syndrome), an autosomal dominant, primary immunodeficiency disorder.

Hyper-IgE syndrome is characterized by impaired JAK-STAT signaling, leading to defective
differentiation and function of T-helper cell type 17 (Th17). Th17 cells normally produce IL-
17, which activates neutrophils to migrate to the site of infection. Without this cytokine,
neutrophil function is impaired, causing recurrent skin and sinopulmonary infections most
commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Neutrophil-induced
inflammation is absent, so abscesses are often nontender (ie, cold), and patients are typically
afebrile with a normal leukocyte count, as opposed to the leukocytosis expected with infection.

In addition to immunodeficiency, chronic atopic dermatitis is a prominent feature of hyper-
IgE syndrome and typically begins in early infancy. Colonization of S aureus and C albicans
on the skin triggers mast cell histamine release, causing severe pruritus and an eczematous
rash. Patients characteristically have eosinophilia and elevated IgE related to the dermatitis,
but other immunoglobulin levels are usually normal. Alow Th17 count supports the
diagnosis, and molecular genetic testing is confirmatory.
