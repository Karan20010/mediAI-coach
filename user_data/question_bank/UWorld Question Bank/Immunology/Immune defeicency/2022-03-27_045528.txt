Host defense against mycobacterial infections depends on the ability of macrophages to
sequester mycobacteria in granulomas and directly kill the bacteria in phagosomes. Infected
macrophages produce IL-12, which stimulates T cells and natural killer cells to produce
interferon-y (IFN-y). Binding of IFN-y to its receptor on a macrophage causes transcription of
IFN-y-regulated genes through activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The result is
upregulation of IL-12 production, enhanced mycobacterial intracellular killing in
phagolysosomes, and production of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) which promotes formation

of granulomas.

Autosomal recessive deficiencies of the IFN-y receptor (or other elements of this pathway)
result in disseminated mycobacterial disease (or BCG infection if the vaccine is
administered) in infancy or early childhood. These patients require lifelong treatment with
continuous antimycobacterial antibiotics.

(Choice A) X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is an immunodeficiency disorder
characterized by significantly reduced mature B cell production. These patients are deficient in
all types of immunoglobulins; predisposing them to recurrent lower respiratory tract infections
due to encapsulated bacteria (eg, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae).

Choice B) Deficiencies of C5-C9, the components of the complement membrane attack
