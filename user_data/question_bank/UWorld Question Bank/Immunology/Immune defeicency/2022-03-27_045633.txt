This infant with recurrent pulmonary and skin infections likely has a primary immunodeficiency
disorder. The presence of a large number of intact bacteria inside the neutrophils suggests
chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an X-linked recessive immunodeficiency marked by
impaired NADPH oxidase activity.

NADPH oxidase resides on the plasma membrane of neutrophils and is incorporated into the
membrane of the phagolysosome during phagocytosis; it catalyzes the formation of
superoxide free radicals, which subsequently destroy engulfed pathogens (eg, fungi,
bacteria) as part of the oxidative burst. Because patients with CGD have impaired NADPH
oxidase activity, they are not able to efficiently destroy bacteria and fungi following
phagocytosis; therefore, microscopy will often reveal intact microbes in the neutrophil
phagolysosome during active infection.

Patients with CGD are most susceptible to catalase-positive organisms, particularly
Staphylococcus aureus, Burkholderia, Serratia, Nocardia, and Aspergillus. Catalase degrades
hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen, which reduces oxidative damage and protease
activation by reactive oxygen species. Although most pathogenic bacteria and fungi produce
catalase, catalase-positive organisms pose a particular risk to patients with CGD because they
require higher levels of free radicals (ie, greater NADPH oxidase function) for effective killing.
