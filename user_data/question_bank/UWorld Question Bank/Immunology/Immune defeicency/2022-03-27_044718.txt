This patient's peripheral smear shows giant cytoplasmic granules within neutrophils, a
finding pathognomonic for Chédiak-Higashi syndrome (CHS), an autosomal recessive
disorder in which lysosomal trafficking is impaired. Characteristic findings include the
following:

¢ Immunodeficiency from a defect in neutrophil phagosome-lysosome fusion, which
prevents release of cytotoxic granules and leads to impaired bacterial killing. These giant
granules are visualized on peripheral blood smear, and patients have recurrent
infections (eg, skin, respiratory) with pyogenic bacteria. Impaired natural killer cell
function may also contribute to immune dysfunction.

¢ Oculocutaneous albinism (eg, fair skin, silvery hair, light blue eyes) due to impaired
melanocyte transport of melanin to keratinocytes in the epidermis and epithelial cells in the
retina. Because melanin is also involved in the embryologic development of ocular
structures (eg, optic nerve), reduced visual acuity and nystagmus may occur.

(Choice A) Ataxia telangiectasia is a DNA repair disorder characterized by immunodeficiency
(eg, recurrent sinopulmonary infections), neurologic deficits (eg, ataxia, nystagmus), and
telangiectasias of the skin and eyes. Giant cytoplasmic granules on peripheral smear would
not be present.
