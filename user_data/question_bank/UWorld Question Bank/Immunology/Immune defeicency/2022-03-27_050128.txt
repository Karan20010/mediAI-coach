Enterovirus is a common infection in children that typically causes self-limited disease, such
as herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, or in some cases, aseptic meningitis. However,
because neutralizing antibodies are required to clear Enterovirus, severe life-threatening
infection can occur in infants with a primary humoral immunodeficiency such as X-linked
agammaglobulinemia (XLA).

XLA, or Bruton agammaglobulinemia, is due to a mutation in the BTK gene encoding Bruton
tyrosine kinase. A defect in this protein prevents pre-B cells from differentiating and exiting the
bone marrow. Therefore, patients have low circulating B lymphocytes and low
immunoglobulin levels.

In addition to enteroviral infection, XLA also increases the risk for recurrent sinopulmonary
infections by encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae
type b), which require antibody opsonization for phagocytosis. Patients with impaired humoral
immunity are also predisposed to gastrointestinal infections (eg, Sa/monella,
Campylobacter), as well as chronic giardiasis (due to low secretory IgA).

(Choice A) An abnormal dihydrorhodamine test indicates an impaired neutrophil respiratory
burst, which occurs in chronic granulomatous disease. Patients have recurrent skin and
pulmonary infections with catalase-positive organisms (eg, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia
