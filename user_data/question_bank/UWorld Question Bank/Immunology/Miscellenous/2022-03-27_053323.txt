(Choice C) TNF-a is produced by macrophages in response to bacterial endotoxin and
causes symptoms of septic shock (eg, fever, hypotension, and tachycardia) when released in
large amounts. Transfusion transmitted bacterial infection could cause septic shock, but it
would not result in hemoglobinuria.

(Choice D) Allergic transfusion reactions are IgE-mediated (type |) hypersensitivity reactions
against plasma proteins found in transfused blood. They can be mild (urticaria, itching) or
result in severe anaphylaxis (most common in IgA-deficient patients with anti-IgA antibodies).

(Choice E) Vascular deposition of immune complexes is an example of type III
hypersensitivity. In conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis,
antigen-antibody complexes deposit in various tissues and activate complement, causing
tissue inflammation and destruction.

Educational objective:

Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is a antibody-mediated (type II) hypersensitivity reaction

caused by pre-existing anti-ABO antibodies that bind antigens on transfused donor

erythrocytes. Subsequent complement activation results in erythrocyte lysis, vasodilation, and

symptoms of shock. Common findings include fever, hypotension, chest and back pain, and

hemoglobinuria. Activate V
