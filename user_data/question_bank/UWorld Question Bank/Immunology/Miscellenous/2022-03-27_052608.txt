This patient's peripheral blood smear reveals a reactive (atypical) lymphocyte. In contrast to
normal lymphocytes, which are small, round, and have minimal cytoplasm, reactive
lymphocytes are large, scalloped, and have abundant cytoplasm.

Reactive lymphocytes are activated, pathogen-specific cytotoxic T cells and natural killer
cells that form in response to certain intracellular infections (eg, HIV, cytomegalovirus,
toxoplasmosis); they are particularly linked to infectious mononucleosis, a primary Epstein-
Barr virus characterized by fever, pharyngitis, adenopathy, splenomegaly, and severe fatigue
(as is likely in this patient).

Reactive lymphocytes are effector cells that contain cytotoxic granules composed of
perforin (creates holes in the infected cell's membrane) and granzymes (enter the cytoplasm
of infected cells and trigger cell death), which are released in response to foreign antigens on
the surface (MHC class | receptors) of infected host cells.

(Choice A) Elastase breaks down collagen and is released by neutrophils and macrophages
during acute inflammation. Neutrophils have multi-lobe nuclei and pinkish cytoplasm;

macrophages have central round nuclei and abundant greyish, vacuolated cytoplasm. Neither

typically has scalloped edges or abundant basophilic cytoplasm.
