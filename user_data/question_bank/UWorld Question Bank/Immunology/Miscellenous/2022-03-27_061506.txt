Mycobacterium tuberculosis is transmitted by aerosolized droplets from a patient with active
pulmonary tuberculosis. Initially, the pathogen replicates in an unchecked fashion due to
virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that allow the bacteria to escape destruction within the
phagolysosomes of alveolar macrophages. After a few weeks, antigen-presenting cells in the
draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major compatibility complex class
Il molecules and release interleukin-12, which differentiates naive CD4 cells into T-helper
subtype-1 (Th1) cells.

Th1 cells migrate to the sites of infection and secrete interferon-gamma, resulting in the
activation of macrophages. Activated macrophages are able to form fully mature
phagolysosomes to destroy intracellular mycobacteria. They also differentiate into cells (eg,
epithelioid, Langhans giant cells) that surround extracellular mycobacteria and form
granulomas. Granulomas have an acidic, hypoxic central environment that limits the
proliferation of mycobacteria but does not usually eliminate the infection.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) is a common screening test for VM tuberculosis exposure. It
involves injection of tuberculin antigens into the skin, which provokes a T-cell-mediated,
delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in those who have been previously exposed (induration
at 48-72 hours). Because the cell-mediated response to M tuberculosis takes several weeks
