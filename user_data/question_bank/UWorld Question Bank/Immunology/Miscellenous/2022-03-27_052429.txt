(Choice C) Monoclonal antibodies that target specific cell surface molecules on the tumor can

induce tumor cell death via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. An example of this type of

immunotherapy is alemtuzumab, a drug for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that targets a cell

surface receptor (CD52) found primarily on mature lymphocytes. However, IL-2 does not

directly interact with the Fc receptor on cytotoxic cells.

(Choice E) Although IL-2 triggers CD8 cells to increase expression of the inhibitory receptor
PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), engagement of this receptor leads to T-cell
exhaustion, not increased antitumor activity.

Educational objective:

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is endogenously produced by CD4 cells, CD8 cells, and natural killer (NK)
cells and has strong proinflammatory and some anti-inflammatory effects. High-dose IL-2
therapy can be used for advanced renal cell carcinoma and metastatic melanoma; this can
lead to long-lasting remission due to increased cytotoxic activity of NK cells against the tumor.
