Educational objective:

Transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) proteins are necessary for loading of
cytoplasmic (eg, viral) proteins onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class |

molecules. The MHC class I-peptide complex can then activate CD8- cytotoxic T cells through

interaction with the T cell receptor and CD8 coreceptor.
