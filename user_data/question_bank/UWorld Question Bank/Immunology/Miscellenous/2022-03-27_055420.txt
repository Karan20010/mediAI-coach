Clostridium tetani is a thin, gram-positive rod with a round terminal spore that grows in strict
anaerobic conditions. It is anormal commensal of the gastrointestinal tract of many mammals
and is found in soil worldwide. Transmission to humans typically occurs when C tetani spores
are inoculated into a skin wound. In anaerobic conditions, the spores germinate into a
vegetative rod and replicate locally. The bacteria also produce an neurotoxic exotoxin called
tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin) that travels by retrograde axonal transport through the lower
motor neurons to the central nervous system. Here, it acts at the level of the anterior horn
cells, blocking inhibitory neurotransmission, which results in the clinical syndrome of
tetanus. Manifestations include increased muscle tone (eg, opisthotonos, lockjaw), painful
spasms, and autonomic instability.

In the United States, the tetanus toxoid vaccine (formaldehyde-inactivated tetanus toxin) is
part of routine childhood vaccinations. This vaccine stimulates a humoral antibody response
against tetanus toxoid that prevents the toxoid from causing neurological damage. Tetanus is
very rare in those who have been vaccinated; almost all cases occur in unvaccinated
individuals or those who have not received appropriate booster vaccines.

cell type responsible for granuloma formation. Although macrophages help clear bacteria
