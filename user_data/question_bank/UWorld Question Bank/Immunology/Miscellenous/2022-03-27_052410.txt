are better tolerated.

(Choice A) Tumor hypoxia and lactic acid production increase release of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), which promotes angiogenesis required for tumor growth. Therefore,
anti-VEGF immunotherapy (eg, bevacizumab) can induce a potent antitumor response; it is
often used for lung and colorectal cancer.

(Choice B) Although CD8 and NK cells induce cell death via apoptosis, this effect is not
mediated by direct binding of IL-2 to the tumor cell. Certain chemotherapy drugs (eg,
etoposide, vincristine, cyclophosphamide) directly induce apoptosis by damaging tumor cell
DNA, the cytoskeleton, or mitochondria.

(Choice C) Monoclonal antibodies that target specific cell surface molecules on the tumor can
induce tumor cell death via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. An example of this type of
immunotherapy is alemtuzumab, a drug for chronic lymphocytic leukemia that targets a cell
surface receptor (CD52) found primarily on mature lymphocytes. However, IL-2 does not
directly interact with the Fc receptor on cytotoxic cells.

(Choice E) Although IL-2 triggers CD8 cells to increase expression of the inhibitory receptor
PD-1 (programmed cell death protein 1), engagement of this receptor leads to T-cell

exhaustion, not increased antitumor activity.
