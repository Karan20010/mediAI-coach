Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitor added to methotrexate to treat
moderate-to- severe rheumatoid arthritis in patients who have failed methotrexate alone. It is
a fusion protein linking a soluble TNF-a receptor to the Fc component of human
immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Etanercept reduces the biological activity of TNF-a by acting asa

decoy receptor: the TNF-a receptor component acts like a sponge to bind TNF-a and keep it
away from functional TNF-a receptors, while the Fc component stabilizes the complex.

Pharmaceutical companies provide the prefix of the names for biological agents; the suffix
indicates whether the medication is a monoclonal antibody (mab), a receptor molecule (cept),
or a kinase inhibitor (nib). Monoclonal antibodies, which are the largest group of biological
agents, also include in their names the type of target (eg, bacterial or immune system) and
their origin (eg, human or mouse).

(Choice A) Rituximab (Ri-tu-xi-mab) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against
CD20, a cell receptor found on the surface of B cells. It is used to treat CD20+ non-Hodgkin's
lymphomas and other diseases related to excessive B-cell function.

(Choice B) Infliximab (Inf-li-xi-mab) is a chimeric monoclonal antibody targeted against TNF-
a. It is used in the treatment of a number of autoimmune diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis

and Crohn's disease).
