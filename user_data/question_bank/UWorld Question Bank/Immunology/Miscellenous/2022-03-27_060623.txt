There are 2 classes of CD4- T-helper cells, Th1 cells and Th2 cells. Th1 cells contribute to
cell-mediated adaptive immunity (targeting intracellular pathogens) and type IV (delayed-type)
hypersensitivity reactions. On the other hand, Th2 cells play a prominent role in allergic

response and type | hypersensitivity reactions.

One hypothesis for the pathogenesis of asthma is an excess of Th2 cell activity relative to
Th1 cell activity, resulting in excessive IgE production, an abnormal propensity for type |
hypersensitivity reactions, and associated chronic eosinophilic bronchitis. In the asthma
sensitization phase, inhaled antigens stimulate Th2 cells to secrete IL-4 and other
lymphokines to stimulate B-cell antibody production as part of humoral adaptive immunity. Th2
cells also release IL-13, which, together with IL-4, promotes B-cell immunoglobulin class
switching to IgE and leads to mast cell priming.

Repeat exposure to inhaled antigens leads to mast cell degranulation of inflammatory
substances (eg, histamine, leukotrienes) and further activation of eosinophils with release of
tissue-damaging substances (eg, major basic protein).

(Choice A) IL-1 is predominantly involved in the Th1 response and stimulates fever and acute
inflammation. It also induces lymphokine secretion to recruit other leukocytes, including

lymphocytes.
