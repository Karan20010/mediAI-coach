a segment of chromosome q11.2). Failed development of the thymus results in T ce
deficiency, which would be evident by a reduction in CD3- cells on flow cytometry.

(Choice B) CD40 ligand (CD40L) is expressed on activated T helper cells and interacts with
CD40 on B cells to promote immunoglobulin class-switching. Impaired CD40L expression can
result in hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome (ie, high IgM levels and low/absent circulating IgG,
IgA, and IgE). Although this patient's mutation impairs activation of T cells, his CD4- T cells

would still be capable of expressing CD40L upon activation.

(Choice C) Maturation of pro-B cells into pre-B cells with resulting expression of B cell—
specific surface markers (eg, CD19, CD40) is dependent on signal transduction by Bruton
tyrosine kinases. A mutation in the BTK gene causes X-linked agammaglobulinemia, which is
characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections after maternal IgG is
depleted (~3 months of age). Flow cytometry would show a marked decrease in CD19- cells.

Educational objective:

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are encoded by the HLA-DP, HLA-
DQ, and HLA-DR genes and present extracellular antigens processed in acidified lysosomes
by antigen-presenting cells (eg, B cells, macrophages). Absence of MHC class II expression
impairs activation of B and T cells, resulting in a form of severe combined immunodeficiency.
