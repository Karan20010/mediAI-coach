(Choices C, D, and E) Th2 cells are involved in humoral immunity and defense against
extracellular parasites. Asthma, a Th2-driven disease, causes dyspnea and cough but is not
associated with granuloma formation. Cytokines involved with asthma include IL-4 and IL-5,
which are secreted by Th2 cells. IL-4 promotes B-cell class switching to form IgE antibodies,
and IL-5 promotes eosinophil production and activation. IL-3 is also involved in asthma (as it
promotes survival of mast cells) but mainly supports the growth and differentiation of bone
marrow stem cells.

Educational objective:

Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas due to dysregulated cell-mediated
immunity. Activated antigen-presenting cells produce IL-12, which stimulates the
differentiation of Th1-type CD4- cells. Th1 cells produce IL-2 and interferon-y, which stimulate

Th1 cell proliferation and macrophage activation, respectively.
