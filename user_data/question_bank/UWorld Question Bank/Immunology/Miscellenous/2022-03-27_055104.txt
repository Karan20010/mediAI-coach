Researchers are developing a vaccine to protect against a novel coronavirus infection. The
virus spreads via droplet inhalation and enters respiratory epithelium using viral spike

proteins. The researchers develop mRNA for the spike protein in vitro and formulate an MRNA
vaccine that can be administered to susceptible individuals. The protective effect generated
by this vaccine most likely involves which of the following mechanisms?

A. Enhanced extracellular RNase enzyme production (1%)
YB. Expression of viral protein by antigen-presenting cells (56%)

C. Formation of antibodies targeting viral MRNA (35%)

D. Integration of viral mRNA into the host genome (6%)
