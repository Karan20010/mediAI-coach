This patient's history of recurrent respiratory infections and dextrocardia on physical
examination are suggestive of Kartagener syndrome, a form of primary ciliary dyskinesia
(PCD). This autosomal recessive condition is caused by a wide variety of mutations that
impair ciliary structure or function.

Eukaryotic flagella and cilia are composed of a central core known as the axoneme that is
surrounded by cell membrane. The axoneme of flagella and motile cilia consists of a circular
array of microtubule doublets surrounding 2 central microtubules (9+2 arrangement); the
axoneme is anchored to the cell by a basal body. Each doublet has an A and B subunit and is
connected to the adjacent doublet via dynein arms. These dynein arms contain an ATPase
that generates energy to slide the microtubules past each other, producing ciliary movement.
Primary ciliary dyskinesia can result from failure of the dynein arms to develop normally.

Patients with PCD experience recurrent respiratory infections (eg, chronic sinusitis,
bronchiectasis) as a result of impaired mucociliary clearance. In addition, impaired ciliary
movement during embryogenesis can cause situs inversus (reversed right/left positioning of
internal organs). Infertility in men (impaired sperm motility) and women (immobility of
fallopian tube cilia) is another frequent manifestation.
