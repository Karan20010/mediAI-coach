Influenza vaccination is administered either by injection (inactivated [killed] vaccine) or nasal

spray (live attenuated vaccine). Each seasonal influenza vaccine contains antigens (or

attenuated virions) from 3 or 4 influenza A and B virus strains. Antigens from multiple influenza

types are included in the vaccine because antibodies against 1 strain confer limited or no

protection against the others. Annual vaccination is recommended due to waning

effectiveness over time and because circulating strains of influenza change from year to year.

All individuals age >6 months should be immunized, especially health care workers and those

at risk of serious complications such as the elderly, patients with chronic illness (eg, chronic

obstructive pulmonary disease), and immunocompromised individuals.

Inactivated versions of the influenza vaccine stimulate the formation of neutralizing
antibodies against the hemagglutinin antigen of included strains. Subsequent exposure to
a strain of influenza included in the vaccine will not result in infection because the antibodies
bind to hemagglutinin, thereby preventing hemagglutinin from attaching to the sialic acid
receptor on host respiratory epithelial cells (preventing viral entry).

(Choice A) Because inactivated viral vaccines do not infect host cells, they are not processed
by the MHC class | pathway and do not stimulate a potent CD8- T-cell response. In contrast,

live attenuated influenza vaccines replicate in nasopharyngeal cells and are displayed on MHC
