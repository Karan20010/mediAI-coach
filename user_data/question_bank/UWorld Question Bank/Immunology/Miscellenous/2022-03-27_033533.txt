This patient's pruritic skin rash following wilderness exposure is consistent with poison ivy
dermatitis, a form of contact dermatitis. Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac all
produce urushiol, a small allergenic substance that causes an immune response when
attached to proteins (ie, a hapten). Following contact with these plants, patients develop a
highly pruritic, erythematous rash consisting of papules, vesicles, and bullae that may show
signs of excoriation. The rash most frequently affects exposed skin (eg, legs, forearms) and

often forms linear streaks as the patient walks past the plant, dragging it along the skin.

Contact dermatitis is a type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction that occurs in 2 distinct

phases:

1. The sensitization phase leads to the creation of hapten-specific T cells and takes 10-14
days. Cutaneous dendritic cells take up the haptens and express them on MHC-I and
MHC-II molecules as hapten-conjugated peptides. These dendritic cells travel to the
draining lymph nodes and interact with hapten-sensitive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, causing
activation and clonal expansion.

2. The elicitation phase occurs within 2-3 days following re-exposure to the same antigen
(or following sensitization after first exposure to a highly antigenic antigen such as
urushiol). In this phase, the hapten is taken up by skin cells and causes activation of
