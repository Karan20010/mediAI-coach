(Choice A) Nontypable strains of Haemophilus influenzae are not encapsulated; therefore,
these strains are susceptible to phagocytosis and immunoglobulin-mediated opsonization.
Control is not primarily mediated by the formation of MACs.

(Choice B) Host defense to Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends more on T-cell and antigen-
presenting cells than on complement activation and MAC formation.

(Choices D and E) Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes often secrete
factors that disable the complement cascade. Therefore, they are primarily countered by other
components of the immune system (eg, neutrophils, humoral immunity).

Educational objective:

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria leads to the formation of membrane attack complexes
on erythrocytes. Treatment with monoclonal antibody against C5, the first component of the
membrane attack complex, can improve symptoms. However, it also increases risk for
encapsulated bacterial infection. Therefore, patients require vaccination and antibiotic
prophylaxis against Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
