(Choice B) Disabling arthritis can be associated with plaque psoriasis, which classically
presents with thick, silvery scales involving the knees, elbows, scalp, and lower back, features
not seen in this patient.

(Choice D) Proximal muscle weakness is characteristic of juvenile dermatomyositis, which
can cause facial erythema but classically presents with a heliotrope rash on the upper eyelids.
In addition, the onset typically occurs in school-aged children, not infants.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 can cause transient anemia due to viral destruction of erythrocyte
progenitor cells, typically in patients with red blood cell disorders (eg, sickle cell anemia).
Initial symptoms include a nonspecific prodrome (eg, fever, coryza), followed by a nonpruritic,
malar rash (ie, slapped cheeks) in school-aged children. This patient's age, lack of prodromal
symptoms, and pruritus make this diagnosis unlikely.

Educational objective:

Atopic dermatitis increases the risk for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies, likely
because of an immune response that favors IgE production. In addition, skin barrier
dysfunction facilitates food allergen penetration and sensitization, increasing the risk for food
allergies.
