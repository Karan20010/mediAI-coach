to myeloablative chemotherapy causes a period of temporary, profound
immunosuppression until donor cells engraft and reconstitute the peripheral blood cells.
During this period of immunosuppression, chronic or latent infections may worsen. Risk is
particularly high for the reactivation of human herpesviruses (eg, Epstein-Barr virus,
cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus), which establish life-long latent
infections and require an intact cytotoxic T-cell response for control.

(Choice D) There is little risk of transfusing a new bloodborne infection (eg, primary EBV, HIV,
hepatitis virus, cytomegalovirus) in autologous HCT because the donor cells are obtained from
the patient themself.

Educational objective:

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reinfuses host cells from the patient's
peripheral blood or banked cord blood to reconstitute the bone marrow. Because the reinfused
cells are genetically identical to the host's, there is no risk of graft rejection or graft versus host
disease. Although there is also no risk of transferring a new bloodborne pathogen, chronic or
latent infections (eg, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus) may worsen
due to the transient immunosuppression induced by myeloablative chemotherapy.
