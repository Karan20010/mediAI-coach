Vaccine hesitancy is the delay or refusal of immunization. Reasons typically include safety
concerns, desire to express autonomy, distrust of medicine, or ethical/religious beliefs. Some
parents also believe that natural infection is benign and/or the risk of infection is too low to
warrant preventive measures. However, vaccination is critical on an individual and community
level to decrease the incidence and severity of vaccine-preventable illness.

The first step in approaching parents who are vaccine-hesitant is to initiate an open and
nonconfrontational dialogue. The conversation should include:

¢ relaying the shared goal of the parent and provider, which is the child's health and
safety.

¢ acknowledging the parent's concern as well as the accessibility to vast amounts of
vaccine information, both evidence-based and not, that can be overwhelming and
confusing.

¢ dispelling specific misconceptions. For example, this patient's mother is concerned
that vaccines can be harmful to the immune system, whereas vaccines in fact elicit an
immune response to protect from future infection. In addition, some reported symptoms
postvaccination (eg, prolonged cough) are often incorrectly attributed to the vaccination
