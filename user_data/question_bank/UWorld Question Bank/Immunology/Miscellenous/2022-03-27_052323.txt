vulvovaginitis).

¢ Neutrophils: Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the protection against
invasive Candida (eg, candidemia, deep tissue infections). Neutrophils kill Candida by
releasing reactive oxygen species, lactoferrin, lysozyme, elastase, and beta-defensins.
They are also the only immune cell that is able to prevent germination of Candida yeasts
into penetrating hyphae.

Patients who undergo cytotoxic chemotherapy and develop neutropenia are at dramatically

increased risk for invasive infection. Indwelling central intravascular catheters are also a major

risk factor for invasive disease.

(Choice A) Early complement proteins (eg, C3b, C5b) assist opsonization, and late
complement proteins (C5-C9) form the membrane attack complex. Complement is crucial for
control of bacterial infections, but it plays a minimal role in the control of Candida. In addition,
complement levels are not particularly diminished by chemotherapy.

(Choice B) Candida is primarily controlled by neutrophils, macrophages, and helper T cells;
immunoglobulins have more of an adjunctive role. In addition, immunoglobulin levels are not
typically affected by most cytotoxic chemotherapy because memory B cells are long lasting

and have low rates of cellular division.
