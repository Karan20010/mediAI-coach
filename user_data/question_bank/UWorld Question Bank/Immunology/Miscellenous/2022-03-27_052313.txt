infection with Candida albicans, a small, elliptical, budding yeast. Visualization of
pseudohyphae, a chain of budding yeasts joined together with end-to-end at constrictions, is
an important diagnostic clue. C albicans is distinguished from other Candida species by its
ability to form germ tubes (true hyphae with no constrictions) when incubated at 37 C (98.6 F)
for 2-3 hours (ie, germ tube test).

C albicans is a human commensal organism that may cause mucocutaneous infection in
otherwise healthy individuals but rarely causes invasive disease. Protection against infection
is mediated by the following:

e Intact epithelium: Candida triggers toll-like receptors on epithelial cells to release
proinflammatory cytokines, which recruit immune cells to the area; epithelial cells also
release beta-defensins, which provide antifungal activity.

e Resident macrophages/monocytes: Penetration of epithelial cells by fungal hyphae
causes resident macrophages to release inflammatory cytokines that recruit lymphocytes,
monocytes, and neutrophils to the area of infection. T helper lymphocytes specific for
Candida antigens help drive the epithelial and macrophage response, and are important
for prevention of superficial Candida infection (eg, oral/esophageal, cutaneous,
