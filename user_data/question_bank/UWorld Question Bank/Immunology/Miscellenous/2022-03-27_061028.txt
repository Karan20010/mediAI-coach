Bilateral pain, stiffness, and deformity of the proximal interphalangeal and
metacarpophalangeal joints are typical of advanced rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Morning
stiffness, tenderness, and edema of the affected joints predominate early in this disease.
Later, osteopenia, erosions, and joint space narrowing lead to decreased range of motion and
deformities (eg, swan neck, ulnar deviation). Patients can also develop rheumatoid nodules,
firm, nontender, subcutaneous nodules that occur at pressure points such as the elbows or
forearms.

RA is due to failure of immune tolerance, with development of an autoreactive immune
response directed against joint components (eg, type II collagen, citrullinated vimentin). CD4-
T-helper cells become activated by these self-antigens and release cytokines that promote
chronic inflammatory synovitis. CD4- T cells also induce B cells to synthesize rheumatoid
factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). Rheumatoid factor is an antibody
(typically IgM) specific for the Fe component of IgG. Rheumatoid factor binds circulating IgG
and ACPAs bind modified self-proteins, forming immune complexes that deposit on the
synovium and cartilage. These complexes activate complement in those locations,
contributing to chronic inflammation and joint destruction.

(Choice A) Anticentromere antibodies are found in the majority of patients with CREST
