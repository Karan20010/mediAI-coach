(Choice C) Most nucleated cells of the human body express MHC Class | molecules on their
surfaces. MHC Class | molecules present intracellular antigens produced in tumor or virus-
infected cells. Cytoplasmic proteins are degraded by a proteasome and transported into the
rough endoplasmic reticulum (via TAP proteins) where they are loaded onto MHC Class |
molecules and routed to the cell surface. This pathway does not depend on acidified
lysosomes.

(Choice E) The T cell receptor (TCR) is a membrane-bound protein on T cells that is
responsible for recognizing specific antigens bound to an MHC molecule. Although the TCR is
essential for T cell activation in response to antigens presented on MHC Class II molecules,
prevention of lysosome acidification would have no effect on the expression of TCR on the
surface of T cells.

Educational objective:

MHC class II is expressed on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) and presents
extracellular antigens to T cells after extracellular protein is degraded within acidified
lysosomes. Failure to acidify lysosomes would lead to deficient expression of MHC class II-
antigen complexes with subsequent impaired interaction between APCs and T cells.
