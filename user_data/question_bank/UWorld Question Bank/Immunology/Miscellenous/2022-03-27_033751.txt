Educational objective:
IgG, IgA, and IgD have a hinge region between the Fab fragment and the Fc fragment of the

immunoglobulin. The hinge region increases flexibility of the Fab arms, which makes the
antibody more likely to bind to more than one site on the antigen. This increases the avidity of
the immunoglobulin but makes it more susceptible to destruction by bacterial proteases.
