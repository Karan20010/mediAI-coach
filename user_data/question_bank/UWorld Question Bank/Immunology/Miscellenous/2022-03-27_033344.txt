Although these 2 complement components generate significant inflammation, the complement
system is not affected by CTLA4 inhibition.

(Choice B) T cell anergy also impairs T cell-mediated B cell activation, which reduces
antibody and inflammatory cytokine production. However, immune complex clearance by the
reticuloendothelial system is unaffected by exogenous CTLA4 administration.

(Choice C) Developing cytotoxic T cells that interact with self-antigens are eliminated in the
thymus through negative selection, a form of central tolerance. Although this helps prevent
autoimmunity, central tolerance is not mediated by CTLA4.

(Choice E) Sensitization refers to the production of an allergen-specific IgE, which is
mediated by CD4 helper type 2 lymphocytes after exposure to a specific antigen. CTLA4 does
not play a role.

Educational objective:

Abatacept, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, is a fusion of CTLA4 with the Fc portion of
IgG. CTLA4 binds to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells, which prevents CD80/86 from
binding to CD28 on T cells. This reduces T cell costimulation and leads to anergy, which
reduces inflammation.
