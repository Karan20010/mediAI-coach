This patient's bone marrow aspirate has numerous plasma cells, which are distinguished by
the presence of abundant basophilic cytoplasm, perinuclear paleness (large Golgi
apparatus), and nuclei with "clock-face" (peripheral) chromatin. The presence of >10%
plasma cells in the bone marrow raises strong suspicion for multiple myeloma (MM).

In MM, neoplastic plasma cells crowd the bone marrow, leading to impairments in normal
hematopoiesis. B-cell development is particularly affected, which reduces plasma cell diversity
and limits the generation of targeted immunoglobulins against infectious agents.
Therefore, patients with MM have increased risk of recurrent bacterial infections, particularly
of the urinary tract, lungs, and sinuses. Although patients with MM have high levels of
circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin, monoclonal immunoglobulin does not provide
immunity against a diverse range of pathogens.

MM is also associated with normocytic anemia (due to ineffective erythropoiesis), bone pain

(due to osteolytic lesions), hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency (due to clogging of the
tubules with immunoglobulin light chains).

(Choice A) Chediak-Higashi syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that causes
abnormal lysosomal fusion and transport. Although it is associated with recurrent bacterial

infections and hematologic malignancies, most cases are identified in early childhood, and
