= (Choice A) Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination uses Mycobacterium bovis, which shares

5 antigens with tuberculous mycobacteria. This vaccination primes the lymphocyte response

TST.

(Choice B) TB infection is primarily controlled by macrophages and T lymphocytes. The
13 humoral immune system plays a minimal role and does not contribute to TST induration.
Therefore, an autoantibody disorder is unlikely to cause anergy.

(Choice D) Induration typically takes 48-72 hours to form following TST. This patient's test

18 was negative at 72 hours, an appropriate time frame for TST interpretation.

+ 20 (Choice E) Acid-fast bacillus stain and TST do not differentiate nontuberculous from
= tuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a common
