Antigen presenting cells (eg, dendritic cells, macrophages, B lymphocytes) present
extracellular antigens (eg, bacterial, viral) on MHC class || molecules. After phagocytosis or
endocytosis, the protein is degraded in acidified lysosomes and the antigen is loaded onto
an MHC class II molecule.

The MHC class II-antigen complexes are then displayed on the surface of antigen presenting
cells where they can bind to T cell receptors (TCR) to initiate a T cell response to the
antigen. Without lysosomal acidification, exogenous antigen processing and association with
MHC class II molecules would not occur, resulting in impaired interaction between antigen
presenting cells and T cells.

(Choice A) Cytokine receptors are responsible for exerting the biological effects of the various
cytokines (eg, interferons, chemokines, tumor necrosis factors). Expression of these receptors
does not depend on lysosomal acidification and would not directly affect T cell binding to
antigen presenting cells.

(Choice B) Integrins are necessary for the binding of inflammatory cells to vascular walls
during the process of transmigration through the endothelial layer from the bloodstream to
tissues.
