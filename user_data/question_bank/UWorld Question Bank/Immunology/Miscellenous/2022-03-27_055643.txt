(Choice B) Histamine is released by mast cells and basophils during type | (immediate)
hypersensitivity, which is seen in anaphylaxis and allergies, not in PSGN. Mast cells and
basophils are coated by IgE molecules, which cross-link on antigen exposure, triggering the
release of histamine and other mediators.

(Choice C) Autoantibodies are responsible for type II (cytotoxic) hypersensitivity reactions.
This reaction is responsible for Goodpasture syndrome (antibodies directed at type IV
collagen), which can cause nephritic syndrome and hemoptysis. However, it is rare in children
and is not associated with recent streptococcal infection. Other type II hypersensitivity
reactions include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, and
pemphigus vulgaris.

Educational objective:

Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is the most common cause of nephritic syndrome (eg,
hematuria, edema, hypertension) in children, typically occuring 2-4 weeks after a streptococcal
infection (eg, impetigo, cellulitis, pharyngitis). It is caused by a type III (immune-complex—
mediated) hypersensitivity reaction resulting from nephritogenic strains of group A beta-
hemolytic Streptococcus.
