(Choice C) Although chemotherapy impairs the production of granulocytes, which include
eosinophils, basophils, and neutrophils, transient reduction in eosinophil and basophil count
does not drastically increase risk of infection.

(Choice E) T lymphocytes (particularly Th1 and T)17 subtypes) primarily prevent

superficial Candida infection by strengthening the mucosal immune defense; conditions that
impair cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV) are associated with higher risk of mucocutaneous
Candida infection (eg, thrush, esophagitis). However, protection against invasive disease is
mediated primarily by neutrophils, not lymphocytes.

Educational objective:

Neutrophils are the most important immune cell in the defense against invasive Candida
infection; therefore, patients with neutropenia (eg, following cytotoxic chemotherapy) are at
high risk for invasive disease (eg, candidemia, meningitis). In contrast, T lymphocytes are
more important for prevention of superficial, mucocutaneous infection (eg, thrush).
