Rhesus (Rh) antigens are a group of nonglycosylated, transmembrane proteins found on the

surface of red blood cells. The D antigen is the most immunogenic of the group and is present

on the erythrocytes of Rh-positive individuals. When an Rh-negative mother becomes

pregnant with an Rh-positive fetus, fetal red blood cells can enter the maternal circulation and

elicit a maternal antibody response with the formation of memory B lymphocytes (Rh

alloimmunization). After Rh alloimmunization occurs, subsequent pregnancies with Rh-

positive fetuses will be at risk for hemolytic disease of the newborn.

To avoid maternal Rh alloimmunization, Rh-negative mothers must be prevented from
mounting an immune response against the D antigen. Anti-Rh(D) immunoglobulin is a
polyclonal antibody product consisting of IgG anti-D antibodies collected from pooled donor
plasma. It is administered to Rh-negative women during gestation and in the immediate
postpartum period. Once given, anti-Rh(D) antibodies bind to Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes
that enter the maternal circulation, preventing their interaction with the maternal immune
system by promoting sequestration and elimination in the mother's spleen (ie, the
mononuclear phagocyte system).

Although IgG antibodies can cross the placenta, anti-Rh(D) IgG antibodies do not cause
significant transplacental fetal hemolysis because the amount of antibody administered is
