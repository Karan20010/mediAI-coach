(eg, Toxoplasma |gG) will also be elevated in the setting of a past maternal infection.

(Choice C) Maternal IgM may be negative with a remote infection (as with this mother) or
positive if recently infected. False negative IgM titers can also occur in neonates with
congenital infection whose IgM waned before birth or in those who have yet to form a robust
immune response. However, a positive newborn IgG would be expected due to transplacental
transfer of maternal IgG.

Educational objective:

Organism-specific IgM is diagnostic of congenital infection in a symptomatic neonate (eg,
growth restriction, microcephaly, hepatosplenomegaly, blueberry muffin rash). Because
maternal IgG titers are expected with a past infection and neonatal IgG at birth is maternally
derived, elevated newborn IgG is also expected.
