A 19-year-old man comes to the office due to eye pain and blurry vision in both eyes for the
last several days. He sustained an open globe injury to the right eye 3 months ago after being
struck during an altercation and was treated with surgical repair and prophylactic antibiotics.
The left eye was unaffected. At the patient's last follow-up appointment, visual acuity in the
right eye had improved from 20/400 to 20/80. He is otherwise healthy. Temperature is 37.1 C
(98.8 F). Examination is unremarkable apart from bilateral conjunctival injection and
decreased visual acuity in both eyes. Analysis of vitreous samples from both eyes
demonstrates multinucleated giant cells. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely
causing this patient's current manifestations?

() A. Granulomatous response to reactivation of a latent viral infection

©) B. Mixed inflammatory reaction triggered by a gastrointestinal pathogen
