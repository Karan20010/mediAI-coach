after immunization (after IgM peaks) before slowly waning (Choices B and E).

Â¢ Secondary response: subsequent vaccination or pathogen exposure results in a IgM
response similar to initial vaccination due to stimulation of antigen-specific naive B
lymphocytes. However, the previously formed memory B cells quickly differentiate into
long-lasting plasma cells to produce a rapid and sustained IgG response that peaks
around the same time as the IgM response but is greater in magnitude (Choices C and
D). IgG rapidly neutralizes invading organisms and is responsible for the protective effects
of the vaccine.

Educational objective:

Initial vaccination generates an early IgM response by short-lived plasma cells followed by a
delayed-onset, longer-lasting IgG response due to T-cell dependent class switching (IgM
peaks before IgG). Due to formation of memory B cells, secondary responses (eg, booster
vaccination, pathogen exposure) are characterized by a rapid and sustained IgG response
with a short-term, more muted IgM response.
