Parapneumonic effusions occur frequently in bacterial pneumonia as a result of exudative
fluid accumulation within the pleural space. Infections and other forms of inflammatory tissue
injury cause increased vascular permeability, leading to the formation of protein-rich exudates
that contain a variety of biologically active substances. Under the influence of inflammatory
stimuli, cell membrane phospholipids release arachidonic acid, a precursor to the eicosanoid
inflammatory mediators (eg, prostanoids, leukotrienes, lipoxins). The most potent chemotactic
eicosanoid is leukotriene B,. In contrast, the cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes (eg, LTC,,
LTD,, LTE.) cause bronchospasm and increase bronchial mucus secretion and are important in
asthma pathogenesis.

(Choice A) Bradykinin is a component of the kinin system. It causes vasodilation, increases
vascular permeability, stimulates smooth muscle contraction, and helps mediate pain.

(Choice B) Complement components C3a, C4a, and C5a are inflammatory anaphylotoxins
that trigger histamine release from mast cells, resulting in vasodilation and enhanced vascular
permeability. C5a also recruits and activates neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and
basophils. C4a is the least active of these complement components and plays a minor role in

leukocyte recruitment.
