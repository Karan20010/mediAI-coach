(Choice A) Tumor-infiltrating B cells release inflammatory cytokines, display tumor-associated
antigens, and generate tumor-specific immunoglobulin; however, neither B cells nor IgM are
involved in mediating responses to exogenously administered monoclonal antibodies.

(Choice B) CD8 cells release effector cytokines (eg, interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor)
and cytotoxic granules (eg, perforin, granzymes) that destroy tumor cells. However, they
interact with the MHC class | receptors, not monoclonal immunoglobulins.

(Choice D) Macrophages and neutrophils also have CD16 and engage in ADCC and CD16-
mediated phagocytosis of foreign organisms. However, their role in antitumor activity is
unclear. The efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapy is thought to be largely mediated by NK-
cell ADCC.

Educational objective:

Cancer immunotherapy often includes the administration of monoclonal antibodies against a
target overexpressed on the cancer cell surface. The Fc portion of the bound antibody is
identified by natural killer cells via CD16, leading to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity via
the release of granzymes and perforin.
