This patient from Southeast Asia has weight loss, cough, and an apical infiltrate with acid-fast
bacilli, raising strong suspicion for pulmonary tuberculosis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is
transmitted to the lungs via aerosolized droplets. It initially replicates in an unchecked fashion
within the alveoli and alveolar macrophages due to virulence factors (eg, cord factor) that

prevent macrophage-mediated destruction. After a few weeks, infected macrophages in the
draining lymphatic system display mycobacterial antigens on major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class I! molecules, leading to the stimulation of CD4 T lymphocytes.

Stimulated CD4 cells release interferon-gamma that activates macrophages, greatly
increasing their ability to kill phagocytized organisms. Activated macrophages can also
differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and coalesce into multinucleated Langhans giant
cells that wall off mycobacteria within granulomas. The center of the granuloma is acidic and
hypoxic, which causes it to appear acellular, necrotic, and "cheese-like" (caseating).
Granulomas typically limit mycobacterial proliferation but do not fully eliminate the infection.

Although Langhans giant cells are an important component of the immunologic response to
pulmonary tuberculosis, they are a nonspecific finding that may also be present in other
chronic infectious or inflammatory conditions (eg, sarcoidosis, Crohn disease).

(Choice A) Some intracellular bacterial pathogens (eg, Listeria, Rickettsia) have virulence
