Serologic evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) exposure is present in approximately 2 billion
people worldwide. Nearly 250 million of these individuals have chronic infection and can
transmit the virus to others. Perinatal transmission is most common in high prevalence
countries (eg, sub-Saharan Africa); unprotected sex or intravenous drug use causes most
infections in low-incidence countries (eg, United States). Health care providers are at high
risk for infection due to potential exposure to the blood of infected patients.

HBV vaccination is recommended for all health care providers and other high-risk individuals
(eg, intravenous drug users). The vaccine utilizes recombinant HBsAg to generate protective
immunity against the virus. HBsAg is a collection of envelope glycoproteins found on the
surface of HBV; these glycoproteins mediate attachment of the virus to hepatocytes and
subsequent viral entry. Patients who adequately respond to the HBV vaccine generate anti-
HBs antibodies, which bind to circulating viral particles and prevent attachment to and
penetration of hepatocytes.

Patients who have been immunized against HBV as well as those who have cleared the virus
after acute infection will have anti-HBs antibodies. These 2 populations are distinguished by

the presence of anti-HBc antibodies, which are seen only in those who have been exposed to
the virus (not in immunized patients).
