Question Id: 1467
Secretory IgA is the major antibody associated with mucosal immunity. Upon intestinal
exposure to a novel antigen, B cells found in mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches
become activated and preferentially migrate to the lamina propria underlying the intestinal
mucosa. There, they become fully differentiated plasma cells that begin to synthesize IgA
dimers (linked by J chain). These IgA dimers then bind to the polymeric immunoglobulin
receptor (plgR) found on the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells and undergo
transcytosis. As the linked IgA dimer is released into the intestinal lumen, a portion of plgR
remains attached to the antibody (secretory component), forming the complete secretory IgA

molecule.

Stimulation of local secretory IgA production is best promoted when the corresponding
mucosal surfaces are directly stimulated by the antigen. In addition, live attenuated vaccines
generally produce stronger immune responses than killed vaccines by acting as a persistent
stimulus that better activates helper and cytotoxic T cells. As a result, the live attenuated oral
(Sabin) poliovirus vaccine generates a much more robust oropharyngeal and intestinal
mucosal IgA response than the inactivated poliovirus (Salk) vaccine.

(Choice A) Cerebrospinal fluid IgG antibody levels can increase due to a rise in local
production (eg, multiple sclerosis, viral CNS infections) or inflammation of the blood-brain
