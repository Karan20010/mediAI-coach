live attenuated influenza vaccines replicate in nasopharyngeal cells and are displayed on MHC
class | molecules, thereby generating a strong cytotoxic T-cell response that results in the
destruction of the infected cell.

(Choices B and E) Protective antibodies against influenza primarily target the surface
glycoproteins and impair viral entry. Immunization does not typically affect viral genomic
replication or assembly, which occurs in the interior of the cell and cannot be targeted easily by
an antibody response.

(Choice C) Neuraminidase cleaves the terminal sialic acid residues on glycoconjugate
receptors, which releases influenza virions from infected cells. Oseltamivir is a sialic acid
analogue that competitively inhibits influenza neuraminidase, which prevents release of viral
progeny.

Educational objective:

Inactivated (killed or component) viral vaccines primarily generate a humoral immune
response against extracellular viral antigens, preventing viral entry into the cell. In contrast,
live attenuated viral vaccines can generate a strong cell-mediated immune response that can
kill virally-infected cells, in addition to providing humoral immunity.
