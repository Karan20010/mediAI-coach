APC = antigen-presenting cell; MHC = major histocompatibility complex; TCR = T-cell receptor. ©uworid
Abatacept, a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug, is a fusion of CTLA4 with the Fc portion
of IgG (CTLA4-Ig). CTLA4 is a naturally occurring immune checkpoint receptor that is
upregulated on the surface of active T cells. It acts as a brake for the adaptive immune
response by preventing the conversion of antigen-specific naive T cells into effector T cells.

The activation of cytotoxic T cells requires 2 stimulatory signals. First, the T cell must bind to
a specific antigen on the class | major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of an antigen-
presenting cell (APC); then, the bound T cell must be costimulated by an interaction between
the T cell surface receptor CD28 and the APC cell surface ligand CD80/86. T cells that bind
an antigen on an APC but are not costimulated undergo anergy, a form of peripheral
immune tolerance marked by a lack of T-cell response to cytokine, ligand, or antigen
stimulation (T-cell inactivation).

Because CTLA4 binds to CD80/86 with greater affinity than CD28, administration of
exogenous CTLA4 (eg, abatacept) reduces the availability of ligands necessary for T cell

costimulation, which dramatically increases T cell anergy in areas of active inflammation.

(Choice A) C3a and C5a are potent anaphylatoxins, proinflammatory proteins that
degranulate phagocytes/mast cells, increase vascular permeability, and recruit leukocytes.
