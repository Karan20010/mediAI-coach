A 68-year-old man comes to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, chills,
and productive cough. His temperature is 38.9 C (102 F), blood pressure is 108/52 mm Hg,
pulse is 102/min, and respirations are 26/min. Crackles and bronchial breath sounds are
heard over the right lower lung. There is dullness to percussion over the same area. Chest x-
ray reveals right lower lobe consolidation and a right-sided pleural effusion. The patient is
started on the appropriate treatment, and a diagnostic thoracentesis is performed that shows
an uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion. When a sterile sample of the inflammatory
exudate is experimentally introduced into normal human tissue, rapid neutrophil locomotion is
observed. Which of the following components of the exudate is most likely responsible for this

observed effect?
