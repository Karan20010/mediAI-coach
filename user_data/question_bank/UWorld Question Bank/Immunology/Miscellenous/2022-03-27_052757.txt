(Choice E) Chemotherapy often causes transient myelosuppression due to destruction of
rapidly dividing hematopoietic cells. Anti-CD19 therapy may reduce B-cell populations but
does not significantly affect other hematologic cells.

Educational objective:

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy involves extracting T cells from a patient with
malignancy, inserting a CAR gene against a protein overexpressed by the malignancy, and
then reinfusing the modified T cells back into the patient. CAR T-cell therapy against CD19 is
used to treat B-cell malignancy because CD19 is expressed only by B cells.
