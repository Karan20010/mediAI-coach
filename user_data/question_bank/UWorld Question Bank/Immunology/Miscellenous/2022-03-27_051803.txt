Hemolytic disease of the newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis) results from the destruction of
fetal red blood cells by maternal antibodies directed against fetal erythrocyte antigens.
These antibodies are IgG antibodies, the only class of antibody able to cross the placenta.
Erythroblastosis fetalis is most commonly caused by Rhesus (Rh) incompatibility (particularly
the D antigen).

Rh sensitization can occur in an Rh(D)- mother during pregnancy with an Rh(D)+ fetus due
to small amounts of fetal blood crossing the placenta and entering the maternal circulation.
These erythrocytes are viewed as foreign by the maternal immune system and induce the
production of anti-Rh(D) IgG antibodies. In subsequent pregnancies with an Rh(D)+ fetus,
these antibodies cross the placenta and opsonize fetal erythrocytes, causing hemolysis.
This results in a positive direct Coombs test (indicating autoimmune hemolysis), profound
anemia, jaundice (possibly leading to kernicterus), and generalized edema (hydrops fetalis
due to accumulation of interstitial fluid). The severe anemia also stimulates release of
immature, nucleated erythrocytes and leads to persistent extramedullary hematopoiesis in the
liver, spleen, and other tissues (hepatosplenomegaly).

(Choice A) Sickle cell anemia causes vasoocclusion due to abnormal hemoglobin
polymerization. It is asymptomatic in the fetus/neonate due to high levels of fetal hemoglobin
