Educational objective:

Approximately 25% of patients with active TB have false-negative tuberculin skin testing (TST)
(anergy) due to an impaired cell-mediated immune response. These individuals are at greater
risk for severe, disseminated disease and death. False-negative TST can also be seen with
immunocompromise, improper injection technique, and recent infection.
