Most children with HSP-related renal disease have mild nephritis characterized by hematuria,
red blood cell (RBC) casts, non—nephrotic range proteinuria, and a normal creatinine.
However, severe complications (eg, nephrotic syndrome, acute kidney injury) can occur.

(Choice A) IgG autoantibodies to phospholipase A, receptor on podocytes can lead to
subepithelial immune deposition and membranous nephropathy. Patients have nephrotic
syndrome (eg, edema, marked proteinuria [usually 23+]), not hematuria.

(Choice B) Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease is caused by an autoantibody to the
alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen and is often associated with pulmonary hemorrhage.
Although patients have nephritic syndrome with hematuria and RBC casts, arthralgias and
purpura are not seen.

(Choice D) Prothrombotic conditions (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome) can cause thrombosis
of the glomerular capillaries, and urinalysis may show hematuria and/or proteinuria. Although
purpura may occur due to consumptive thrombocytopenia, the lesions would be diffuse, not

localized to the lower extremities (immune complex vasculitis tends to affect dependent areas

of the skin). In addition, his recent upper respiratory tract infection is more characteristic of
HSP.
