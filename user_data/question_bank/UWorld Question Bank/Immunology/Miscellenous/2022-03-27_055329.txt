myeloproliferative disorders and, rarely, certain parasitic infections.

(Choices C and E) Eosinophil activation is associated with reactions to allergens and
parasites, hypersensitivity reactions to drugs, and some hematologic malignancies. Mast
cells, when stimulated (due to antigen-induced cross-linking of IgE on their cell membrane),
release histamine, prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory mediators; they are
active in allergic reactions and anaphylaxis.

(Choice D) B lymphocytes respond to activation by replicating and synthesizing antibodies
specific for the antigen with which they were presented; they are not responsible for TSS.
Neutrophilia is commonly seen with TSS.

Educational objective:

Superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin) interact with major histocompatibility complex
molecules on antigen-presenting cells and the variable region of the T lymphocyte receptor to
cause nonspecific, widespread activation of T cells. This results in the release of interleukin
(IL)-2 from the T cells and IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor from macrophages. This immune
cascade is responsible for the manifestations of toxic shock syndrome.
