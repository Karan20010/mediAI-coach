(Choice C) Mature helper T lymphocytes are also referred to as CD4+ T-lymphocytes; these
cells do not express the CD8 antigen on their surfaces.

(Choice D) Antigen presenting cells include dendritic cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes.
Dendritic cells are professional antigen presenting cells. They take up antigen by endocytosis,
constitutively express MHC Class II and the co-stimulatory B7 molecule, and are able to
activate all forms of T cells (naive, effector and memory). Macrophages are phagocytes that
only inducably express MHC II and B7 and can only activate effector and memory T cells, not
naive T cells. B-lymphocytes take up antigen by receptor-mediated (membrane-bound
antibody) endocytosis and constitutively express MHC II. These cells are able to stimulate all

forms of T-lymphocytes.

(Choice E) Natural killer (NK) cells are part of the innate immune system and function in a
fashion very similar to CD8+ CTLs though they express neither CD8 nor CD4 on their cell

surfaces.

(Choice F) Thymic epithelial cells play a role in positive selection of immature thymocytes in
the thymic cortex. These cells express MHC antigens on their cell surfaces that interact with
the TCR on the immature thymocytes. Thymocytes able to bind MHC receive a protective
signal and do not undergo apoptosis, while thymocytes unable to bind MHC will be killed. This
