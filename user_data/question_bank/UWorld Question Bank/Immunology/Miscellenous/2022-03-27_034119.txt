(Choice A) CD14 is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern receptor on macrophages that
recognizes lipopolysaccharides and rapidly activates the innate immune response; it does not
participate in TST.

(Choice B) CD16 is a receptor on natural killer cells that binds to the FC portion of IgG
attached to foreign antigens on infected cells. Binding triggers lysis of the infected cell via
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (part of the CMIR). Antibodies do not play a significant
role in TST.

(Choice C) CD18 on circulating neutrophils binds to ICAM-1 on the endothelium, allowing
neutrophils to extravasate into tissue. Neutrophils are not a major part of TST reactions.

(Choice E) CTLA4 is an immune checkpoint expressed by regulatory and activated T cells. It
mutes the CMIR by competing with the T-cell costimulatory ligand CD28 for binding CD80/86
(ie, B7) on dendritic cells (APCs). Because CTLA4 binds with greater affinity than CD28 to
CD80/86, it slows the activation of T cells in areas with active inflammation.

Educational objective:
Tuberculin skin testing triggers a type IV delayed-hypersensitivity reaction in patients with
previous infection due to the presence of primed, antigen-specific CD4 T lymphocytes. These

lymphocytes recognize tuberculin proteins displayed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and
