system. However, in this case, the presence of nasal packing and a diffuse, erythematous
rash make TSS far more likely than gram-negative sepsis.

(Choice C) Anaphylactic shock occurs due to antigen-stimulated cross-linking of IgE that is
bound to basophils or mast cells, which activates the cell and releases massive amounts of
inflammatory mediators. Anaphylactic shock is typically characterized by hypotension,
bronchospasm, and shortness of breath; most cases are triggered by insect stings, food, or
medications, and manifestations occur shortly after exposure.

(Choice D) Patients who develop TSS usually have a noninvasive infection in the vaginal
canal or area of wound packing. TSS is mediated by the absorption of superantigens into the
blood, not the invasion of bacteria.

Educational objective:

Toxic shock syndrome is typically associated with the prolonged use of tampons or wound

packing, which allows Staphylococcus aureus to replicate locally and release pyrogenic toxic

superantigens (eg, toxic shock syndrome toxin-1) into the blood. Superantigens bind to the

MHC-II complex of antigen-presenting cells without processing and nonspecifically activate T

cells. This leads to a dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines, which causes the

manifestations of the disease (eg, hypotension; high fever; organ failure; diffuse, erythematous ctivate V
