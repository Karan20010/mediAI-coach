Patients who undergo hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) first receive
myeloablative chemotherapy, a regimen of highly cytotoxic medications that irreversibly kill
existing hematopoietic stem cells. Once pancytopenia is established, patients then receive an
infusion of donor hematopoietic stem cells, which engraft in the bone marrow, proliferate,
and subsequently reconstitute peripheral blood cells. Donor cells are classified as allogeneic
when they are obtained from a related or an unrelated donor and autologous when they are
obtained from the patient (eg, preprocedure peripheral blood or umbilical cord blood banked
at birth).

With autologous transplantation, the human leukocyte antigens on major histocompatibility
complex class | and II molecules will be a perfect match because the donor and recipient are
the same individual. Therefore, there is no risk of graft rejection (host cells attack the graft)
or graft versus host disease (graft cells attack the host) because the delineation between
self and nonself is preserved (Choices A, B, and C).

Although patients who undergo autologous HCT do not require ongoing immunosuppressive
medications following HCT (due to the perfect match between donor and recipient), exposure
to myeloablative chemotherapy causes a period of temporary, profound
