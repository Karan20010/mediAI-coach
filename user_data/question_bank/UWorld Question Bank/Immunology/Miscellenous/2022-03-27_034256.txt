Immunoglobulin is composed of a pair of light and heavy chains linked by disulfide bonds. The
light chain contains a variable region and a constant region; the heavy chain contains a
variable region and 3 or 4 constant regions (C,,1-4). The functional structure of the
immunoglobulin is broadly divided into the 2 following components:
¢ The Fab fragment is the entire light chain plus the variable and first constant (C,,1) regions
of the heavy chain; Fab fragments bind to specific epitopes on antigens using a
hypervariable cluster of 110-130 amino acids in the variable portion of the molecule
(Choices D and E).
¢ The Fe fragment is the remaining constant regions of the heavy chain; the Fc fragment is
the effector portion of the immunoglobulin that interacts with complement and immune
cells.
IgG, the most prevalent immunoglobulin in serum, is the immunoglobulin primarily responsible
for controlling most recurrent bacterial infections. It binds to bacterial epitopes with the Fab
fragment and then exerts its bactericidal effects with the second and third heavy chain

constant regions of the Fc fragment, as follows:

¢ Complement activation: The second heavy-chain constant region serves as a platform
