DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is a highly conserved pathway that maintains genomic
integrity by correcting base-base mismatches and insertions/deletions during DNA replication,
recombination, or repair. Loss of MMR in germline cells is a common driver of malignancy (eg,
colorectal cancer) because it leads to the development of unrepaired oncogenic mutations
during cellular division, which accumulate through generations of cellular progeny. Mutations
in genes that control apoptosis, cellular growth, and epigenetics eventually lead to malignant
transformation.

Cancer cells with damaged MMR typically contain >1,000 somatic coding mutations, whereas
cancer cells with intact MMR usually have only 40-50 (Choice E). MMR impairment greatly
increases the rate of frameshift mutation, resulting in the formation of large quantities of
neoantigens not seen in healthy cells. These neoantigens are displayed on class | major
histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) on the cancer cell surface, leading to the activation of a

diverse, polyclonal pool of antitumor cytotoxic T cells.

Therefore, in order to survive and proliferate, malignant cells with impaired MMR are
particularly dependent on adaptations to avoid cytotoxic T-cell-mediated destruction; these
adaptations typically include downregulating expression of class | MHCs (Choice B), which
impairs identification of the cancer cell by cytotoxic T cells, and overexpressing immune
