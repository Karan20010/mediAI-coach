Pharmacology researchers develop a novel immunotherapy to treat malignancies. In this
therapy, T lymphocytes are harvested from patients with a malignancy and genetically modified
to express a chimeric antigen receptor composed of an extracellular antigen recognition
domain linked with an intracellular T-cell signaling domain. These modified T cells are
expanded ex vivo and then infused back into the patient, where they destroy the cancer cells.
In one of the experiments, they modify the chimeric antigen receptor to recognize CD19. Use
of this treatment is most likely to have which of the following potential complications?

A. Autoimmune endocrinopathy (5%)
B. Graft versus host disease (7%)

SY C. Hypogammaglobulinemia (76%)
D. Myelofibrosis (2%)

E. Prolonged myelosuppression (8%)
