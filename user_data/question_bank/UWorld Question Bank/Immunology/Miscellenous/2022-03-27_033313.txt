arthritis. The patient's condition has been poorly controlled despite prolonged treatment with
multiple disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. The new medication is a CTLA4-lg fusion
protein that prevents CD28 from binding to CD80/86 on antigen-presenting cells. A month
after treatment begins, the patient reports a significant reduction in joint pain and stiffness.

Laboratory results reveal reduced levels of C-reactive protein and IL-2. Which of the following
is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's treatment response?

©) A. Complement inhibition
