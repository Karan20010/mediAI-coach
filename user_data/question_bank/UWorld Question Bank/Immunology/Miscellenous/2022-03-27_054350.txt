HER2 is an epidermal growth factor receptor overexpressed by aggressive breast cancers.
Treatment with a monoclonal antibody (eg, trastuzumab) that targets the HER2 surface
receptor often results in tumor regression. Although antibody binding can trigger cancer cell
death through a variety of mechanisms (eg, receptor downregulation, complement deposition),
much of the response is due to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).

ADCC classically involves the following:
1. Anaturally occurring or monoclonal IgG binds to a complementary surface antigen on a
host or foreign cell.
2. A patrolling natural killer (NK) cell binds the Fe portion of the attached IgG using CD16.
3. Binding triggers the NK cell to release its granules, which contain perforin and
granzymes (proteases) that induce apoptosis/osmotic lysis of the antibody-bound cell.

Although NK cells are derived from the same lymphocyte lineage as B- and T-cells, they are
considered part of the innate immune system because they do not engage with major
histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) to differentiate self from nonself. Unlike cytotoxic T-cells,
NK cells can often identify neoplasms that have downregulated surface expression of MHC-I

molecules.
