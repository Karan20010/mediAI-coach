A 63-year-old man comes to the clinic after noticing a reddish tinge to his urine. During
evaluation for hematuria, an abdominal CT scan reveals a mass in his left kidney. Further
work-up shows multiple lung and bone nodules. CT-guided biopsy of a peripherally located
lung nodule demonstrates renal cell carcinoma. High-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) treatment is
started, and 4 weeks later there is a significant reduction in the patient's tumor burden. Which
of the following mechanisms was most likely responsible for regression of this patient's
malignancy?

A. Antiangiogenic effect of IL-2 (5%)

B. Direct damage to tumor cells by IL-2 (2%)

C. IL-2 binding to Fc receptors on cytotoxic lymphocytes (26%)
YD. Enhanced activity of natural killer cells (46%)

E. Increased expression of PD-1 protein on CD8 T cells (19%)
