role in enabling high-affinity antibodies and immunological memory. Most vaccinations use
peptide antigens or nonpeptides bonded to peptides (ie, conjugate vaccine) so the antigen can
be displayed on MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which leads to a
much stronger T-cell-mediated immune response.

Vaccines given in series (eg, measles, mumps, and rubella) typically trigger the following
immunologic changes:

¢ Primary response: Upon initial vaccination, foreign antigen binds to and activates B
lymphocytes with compatible antigen receptors, leading to clonal B-cell expansion and
differentiation into short-lived plasma cells that secrete low-affinity IgM. Early
production of IgM can be detected in the serum within a few days of immunization. APCs
also ingest the peptide and travel to regional lymph nodes where they stimulate CD4 T
lymphocytes to interact with activated B cells. This interaction facilitates immunoglobulin
class switching from IgM to other types (eg, IgG, IgA) and stimulates B-cell differentiation
into memory B cells. Plasma cells secrete high-affinity IgG, and levels peak a few weeks
after immunization (after IgM peaks) before slowly waning (Choices B and E).

¢ Secondary response: subsequent vaccination or pathogen exposure results in a IgM
