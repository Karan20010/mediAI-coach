v2 This patient has jaundice and hemolytic anemia a week after a transfusion, findings suggestive
= of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR). This reaction occurs in patients who
as were previously exposed to a foreign, minor red blood cell (RBC) antigen (non-ABO) via
5 mechanisms such as pregnancy, prior transfusion, or intravenous drug use. During the first
18 exposure, only a low, typically undetectable, antibody response is initially mounted. On
: = reexposure via transfusion, the patient's memory B cells produced a larger surge of

antibodies, resulting in detectable hemolysis. This is known as an anamnestic response.

23 DHTR is usually mild and develops >24 hours after transfusion, most commonly after 1-2
* weeks. Most patients are asymptomatic and diagnosed only after findings of a newly positive
+ 26 direct antibody (+ Coombs) test and antibody screen. Additional laboratory findings include
: = anemia with compensatory reticulocytosis and evidence of hemolysis (eg, ¢ indirect bilirubin, 7
= lactate dehydrogenase).
at (Choices A and B) Mild hemolysis can result from the transfusion of plasma products (eg,
2 fresh frozen plasma, platelets), which can contain donor antibodies that target ABO or minor
7 34 antigens on recipient RBCs. This reaction does not typically occur with the transfusion of
: = packed RBCs, which this patient received, because RBCs are removed from the plasma layer

and washed during the blood-separation process.
