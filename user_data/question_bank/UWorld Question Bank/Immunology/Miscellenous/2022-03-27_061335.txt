This patient with dyspnea and dry cough has pulmonary infiltrates and hilar adenopathy; this
presentation suggests pulmonary sarcoidosis. The biopsy specimen with multiple,
noncaseating granulomas—characterized by a central collection of tightly clustered
epithelioid macrophages with abundant pink cytoplasm surrounded by a rim of mononuclear
cells—confirms the diagnosis. Multinucleated giant cells, formed by macrophage fusion, are
discernable at higher magnification.

Sarcoidosis is thought to result from a dysregulated cell-mediated immune response to an
unidentified antigen, which causes the formation of granulomas. Cell-mediated immunity is
stimulated by production of IL-12 from activated antigen-presenting cells. IL-12 stimulates
CD4+ helper T cells to differentiate into the Th1 subtype. Th1 cells then secrete IL-2 and
interferon-y (IFN-y). IL-2 stimulates the autocrine proliferation of Th1 cells and furthers Th1
recruitment. IFN-y activates macrophages and promotes granuloma formation. Activated
macrophages and T cells also produce tumor necrosis factor-alpha, further assisting in
leukocyte recruitment and granuloma maintenance.

(Choice B) Th1 cells are central to cell-mediated immunity. However, IL-5 is a product of Th2
cells. Moreover, IL-10 is a cytokine involved in the downregulation of immune responses.
