¢ Complement activation: The second heavy-chain constant region serves as a platform
for activation of the classical complement cascade. This generates membrane attack
complexes and opsonizing C3b ligands for the CR1 receptor on erythrocytes and
reticuloendothelial phagocytes.

¢ Direct phagocytosis: The third heavy-chain constant region is the ligand for the Fe
receptor (CD16) on the surface of phagocytic cells. Binding results in phagocytosis of
the immunoglobulin-covered bacteria and subsequent destruction.

(Choice B) The constant region of the light chain is bound to the first constant region of the
heavy chain with disulfide bonds. It does not play a significant role in opsonization or
phagocyte binding.

(Choice C) Immunoglobulins have hinge regions between the Fab and Fc fragments that
provide flexibility to the Fab arms. Longer hinge regions are associated with increased
antibody avidity because the Fab fragments can reach antigens that are farther apart on the
bacteria. The hinge region does not bind to the Fc receptor on phagocytes.

Educational objective:
Immunoglobulin contains a Fab fragment that binds to antigen and an Fc fragment that
activates complement and/or interacts with immune cells. The Fc fragment of IgG activates
