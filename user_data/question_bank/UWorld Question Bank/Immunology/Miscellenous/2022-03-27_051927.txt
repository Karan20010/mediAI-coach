(Choice A) The immunity conferred by the hepatitis B vaccination is mediated by protective
antibodies against HBsAg; the protective effects are not due to activation of cytotoxic T cells.
However, in patients exposed to HBV, the resolution of acute infection is mediated primarily by
a vigorous, polyclonal cytotoxic T-cell response that destroys infected hepatocytes.

(Choice B) HIV treatment often includes nucleotide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors, which disrupt viral genome replication. Hepatitis C virus is often treated with similar
medications (eg, sofosbuvir) that target viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Immunization
against HBV does not interfere with replication of the HBV genome.

(Choice C) HBV is considered a stealth virus because it possesses virulence factors that
block portions of the innate immune system, including the release of interferon-gamma from
infected cells. However, HBV immunization does not significantly affect the innate immune
system.

(Choice E) NSSA inhibitors (eg, ledipasvir) are thought to block hepatitis C virus replication
and assembly. HBV immunization generates protective antibodies against the HBsAg; it does
not affect viral assembly.

Educational objective:

Immunization against hepatitis B virus uses recombinant HBsAg to generate anti-HBs
