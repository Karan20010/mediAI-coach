Educational objective:

Mycobacterium tuberculosis triggers CD4 T lymphocytes to release interferon-gamma, which
leads to macrophage activation (improves intracellular killing ability) and differentiation into
epithelioid histiocytes. These cells, along with horseshoe-shaped, multinucleated Langhans
giant cells (fused, activated macrophages) are a key component of granuloma formation.
