Type | interferons (a and B) are synthesized by most human cells in response to viral
infections. Once secreted, a and 8 interferons bind to type | interferon receptors found on
infected and neighboring cells (autocrine/paracrine signaling). This results in transcription of
antiviral enzymes capable of halting protein synthesis, such as RNase L (endonuclease that
degrades all RNA in the cell) and protein kinase R (inactivates elF-2, inhibiting translation
initiation). However, these enzymes become active only in the presence of double-stranded
RNA, which forms in infected cells as a result of viral replication. As a result, normal
metabolism and protein synthesis can continue in uninfected cells but is selectively inhibited
in virally infected cells.

(Choice A) Interferons a and B induce MHC class | expression on all cells and stimulate the
activity of natural killer (NK) and cytotoxic T cells. These processes act to increase the
proportion of virally infected cells that undergo apoptosis.

(Choices C and D) Interferon y is a type II interferon produced mainly by T cells and NK
cells. It promotes T,,1 differentiation, increases expression of class Il MHC molecules on
antigen-presenting cells, and improves the intracellular killing ability of macrophages.
However, virally infected respiratory epithelial cells would secrete interferons a and B, not

interferon y.
