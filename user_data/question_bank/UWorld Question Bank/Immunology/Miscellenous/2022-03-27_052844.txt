a leukocytoclastic vasculitis most common in school-aged children and characterized by lower
extremity palpable purpura, arthralgia/arthritis, abdominal pain, and/or renal abnormalities.
HSP is caused by the deposition of IgA immune complexes in small-vessel walls and may be
precipitated by an upper respiratory tract infection, as seen in this patient.

HSP renal disease is an immune-mediated glomerulonephritis with microscopic features

identical to IgA nephropathy:

¢ Mesangial deposition of IgA immune complexes triggers mesangial cell proliferation
and extracellular matrix deposition, primarily via enhanced expression of platelet-derived
growth factor and transforming growth factor beta.

¢ IgA Immune complexes also trigger complement activation via the alternative and lectin
pathways; hydrolyzed complement proteins (eg, c5a) act as chemokines that attract
neutrophils, which produce oxidants and release proteases (eg, elastase) that are
damaging to glomerular capillaries.

¢ Macrophages may also be recruited to the glomerulus, where they cause further damage
to glomerular capillaries, promote fibrin deposition, and contribute to crescent

formation in severe cases.
