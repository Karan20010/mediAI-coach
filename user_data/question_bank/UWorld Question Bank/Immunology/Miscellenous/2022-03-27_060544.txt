This patient has a history of recurrent pneumonia, a diagnosis of celiac disease, and an
anaphylactic reaction during blood transfusion. These findings are highly suggestive of
selective IgA deficiency, the most common primary immunodeficiency. Although most
patients with IgA deficiency are asymptomatic, some may have recurrent sinopulmonary (eg,
sinusitis, pneumonia) and gastrointestinal infections (eg, Giardia) due to absence of
secretory IgA. Concomitant autoimmune disorders (eg, celiac disease) are also common.

Patients with severe IgA deficiency can form IgE antibodies directed against IgA (anti-IgA
antibodies). Serum IgA levels are low or undetectable due to failure of B cells to differentiate
into IgA-secreting plasma cells; serum IgG and IgM levels are normal. When transfused with
blood products (eg, red blood cells, platelets, fresh frozen plasma) containing small amounts
of IgA, these patients can develop potentially fatal anaphylaxis. Therefore, patients with
severe IgA deficiency should wear medical alert bracelets and receive blood products that are
washed of residual plasma or from an IgA-deficient donor.

(Choice A) Acute hemolytic reactions occur when a patient's preexisting IgM or IgG antibody
cross-reacts with antigens (eg, A, B, Rh, Kell) in transfused blood. Reactions range from fever
and chills to severe hemolysis and circulatory collapse. However, anaphylaxis is IgE-mediated
and does not result from ABO incompatibility.
