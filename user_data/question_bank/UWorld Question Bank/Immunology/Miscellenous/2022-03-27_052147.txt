This infant with erythematous and pruritic patches on her cheeks has atopic dermatitis
(eczema), a common childhood condition that typically begins in infancy or early childhood.

The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis is multifactorial and includes genetically mediated skin
barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation) resulting in loss of epidermal water content,
increased permeability to environmental allergens/irritants, and skin inflammation. In addition,
immune dysfunction, characterized by an underlying Th2 skewed response, promotes IL-4 and
IL-13 release, which stimulates IgE production by plasma cells.

Patients with atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE levels are at increased risk for other atopic
diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, and food allergies. A compromised skin barrier
facilitates allergen penetration (eg, from food) and subsequent sensitization, facilitating the
development of food-induced urticaria and anaphylaxis. An earlier onset of atopic dermatitis
(eg, infancy) is associated with a higher risk for developing these associated conditions.

(Choice A) Kawasaki disease, a medium-sized vessel vasculitis, is associated with coronary
artery aneurysms. Patients have a polymorphous rash, in addition to fever, mucocutaneous
inflammation, cervical lymphadenopathy, and extremity changes (eg, edema), none of which
are seen in this case.
