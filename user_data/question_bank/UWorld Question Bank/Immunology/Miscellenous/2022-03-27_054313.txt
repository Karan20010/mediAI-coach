This patient with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus has a nonhealing wound with
evidence of ongoing inflammation (eg, erythema).

Wound healing normally progress through the inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling
phases. In the days after the initial injury, neutrophils and other immune cells are recruited to
the wound and produce an inflammatory response that helps prevent bacterial overgrowth in
the nutrient-rich environment of a healing wound. However, this inflammation also impairs
formation of granulation tissue that is needed for normal wound healing. As healing
progresses, release of growth factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-10) by
macrophages and regulatory T cells suppresses the inflammatory response, facilitating
fibroblast proliferation and reepithelialization of the wound.

In patients with diabetes mellitus, constitutively elevated blood glucose increases
inflammation by stimulating the release of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen
species from neutrophils (Choice E). Elevated glucose also leads to a marked decrease in
IL-10 production that contributes to the increased susceptibility for chronic, nonhealing
wounds and ulcers in patients with uncontrolled diabetes.

(Choice A) Bradykinin is a vasoactive inflammatory mediator that is normally produced by
endothelial cells, macrophages, and platelets during the inflammatory phase of wound
