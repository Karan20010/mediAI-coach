Educational objective:

The pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis likely originates with defects in the intestinal
mucosal barrier and exposure to the gut microbiome that lead to an enhanced IL-17â€”mediated
inflammatory response. IL-17 stimulates production of additional inflammatory factors,
primarily tumor necrosis factor-alpha and prostaglandins, which have synergistic
proinflammatory effects and induce bony erosions and abnormal bone regrowth in the

skeleton.
