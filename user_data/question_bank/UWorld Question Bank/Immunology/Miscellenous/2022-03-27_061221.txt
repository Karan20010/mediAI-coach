secukinumabD) agents.

(Choice A) IL-2 and interferon gamma have broad immune functions, including activation of
the response against viruses and mycobacteria. Both cytokines inhibit Th17 cell differentiation
and do not have a significant role in the pathogenesis of AS.

(Choice B) IL-4 is important in the differentiation of naive Th cells into the Th2 subset,
alternative macrophage activation (M2 type), and IgE production. It may also have a
protective role in AS by limiting IL-17 production by Th1 and Th17 cells. Interferon alpha is
involved primarily in antiviral activity and is not a significant factor in the pathogenesis of AS.

(Choice C) IL-5 induces B-cell growth, IgA production, and eosinophil activity. IL-5 and IL-4
are important in the etiology of certain allergic disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis, asthma), but do
not contribute significantly to AS.

(Choice D) IL-10 is an antiinflammatory cytokine. Transforming growth factor-beta has
antiinflammatory and profibrotic effects. These cytokines have only a minor effect in AS.

Educational objective:
The pathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis likely originates with defects in the intestinal
mucosal barrier and exposure to the gut microbiome that lead to an enhanced IL-17—mediated

inflammatory response. IL-17 stimulates production of additional inflammatory factors
