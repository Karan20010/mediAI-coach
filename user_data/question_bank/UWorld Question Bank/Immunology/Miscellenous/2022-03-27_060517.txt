(Choice B) Terminal complement deficiency (C5b-CQ) results in an inability to form the
membrane attack complex and predisposes to recurrent Neisseria infections. CD18 is not
affected by this condition, and Neisseria infections are not common in LAD.

(Choice D) The absence of B lymphocytes in X-linked agammaglobulinemia leads to
hypoplasia of lymphoid tissue (eg, tonsils, lymph nodes). Patients have recurrent
sinopulmonary infections, but nonpurulent skin infections and absence of CD18 are
inconsistent with the diagnosis.

(Choice E) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by the triad of
thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and eczema. It is caused by a defect in cytoskeleton
rearrangement, not by CD18 deficiency.

Educational objective:

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is due to the absence of CD18 antigens, which are necessary
for the formation of integrins. Failure of leukocyte adhesion and migration results in recurrent
skin and mucosal infections without purulence, delayed umbilical cord separation, and
peripheral leukocytosis.
