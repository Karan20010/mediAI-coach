T-lymphocytes, or thymocytes, are produced in the bone marrow and undergo maturation in
the thymus during the first trimester of gestation. In the thymus the processes of T-cell
receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, positive selection, negative selection and expression of
extracellular membrane markers and co-stimulatory molecules occur. Pro-T cells arrive at the
thymus as "double negative" cells - cells that lack both CD4 and CD8 antigens. Next, the
process of TCR gene rearrangement begins first with rearrangement of the B chain genes.
Synthesis of a productive rearrangement of the 6 chain of the TCR leads to stimulation of
production of BOTH CD4 and CD8 antigens with simultaneous expression of BOTH CD4 and
CD8. These cells are referred to as "double positive" T cells or immature T-lymphocytes
(Choice A). Subsequently, the process of rearrangement of the a chain of the TCR occurs
followed by positive selection in the thymic cortex and negative selection in the thymic
medulla. Once these processes are complete, the final step in maturation of the T-
lymphocytes is loss of either the CD4 or the CD8 antigen so that the mature thymocytes only
express one or the other of these antigens.

(Choice B) Mature cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are also referred to as CD8+ T-
lymphocytes; these cells do not express the CD4 antigen on their surfaces. These cells
recognize and kill altered self cells by recognizing foreign antigen presented by these cells on

MHC Class | molecules on the cell surface.
