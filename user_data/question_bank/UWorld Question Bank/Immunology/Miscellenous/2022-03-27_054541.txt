checkpoint molecules (eg, CTLA4, PD-L1), which impairs T-cell activation and effector
function. Although no approved therapy targets diminished class | MHC expression, treatment
with immune checkpoint inhibitors (eg, ipilimumab, pembrolizumab) can restore cytotoxic T-cell
function in the tumor microenvironment, leading to aggressive antitumor activity.

(Choice C) Regulatory T cells suppress immune activity with surface receptors (eg, CTLA4)
and cytokines (eg, IL-10, TGF-beta). Increased regulatory T cells in the tumor
microenvironment is associated with poor prognosis, but MMR mutations are not associated
with regulatory T-cell recruitment.

(Choice D) Metalloproteinases allow tumor cells to open a channel through the basement
membrane and dislodge from their site of origin. This is an important component of metastasis
but is not strongly associated with MMR deficiency.

Educational objective:

Because tumors with defective DNA mismatch repair generate high levels of neoantigens, they
are particularly dependent on adaptations (eg, overexpression of immune checkpoints) to
avoid cytotoxic T-cell destruction. Treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors restore
antitumor cytotoxic T-cell activity and often dramatically reduce tumor burden.
