(Choice A) Herpes zoster reactivation can cause granulomatous keratouveitis (ie, anterior
chamber inflammation). However, herpes zoster typically reactivates in a single ganglion,
leading to unilateral symptoms.

(Choice B) Spondyloarthritis may be triggered by a gastrointestinal pathogen and result in a
mixed inflammatory reaction that leads to reactive arthritis and uveitis. However, it is not
triggered by previous ocular trauma.

(Choice C) Infectious agents can be introduced during trauma or surgery, which can result in
an acute intraocular infection that prompts a neutrophilic response. However, this would not
affect the contralateral eye.

(Choice E) Although rare, a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to an antibiotic may cause
bilateral uveitis. However, this would occur near the time of antibiotic administration, not 3
months later.

Educational objective:

Traumatic injury to the eye, a site that displays immune privilege, can lead to the release of
previously sequestered antigens that T cells recognize as foreign. This can lead to sight-
threatening inflammation in both the injured and uninjured eye.
