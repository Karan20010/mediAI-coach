13 In order to survive and proliferate, cancer cells must develop adaptations to avoid detection by
: the innate and adaptive immune response. One common adaptation is overexpression of

16 programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) on the tumor cell surface. PD-L1 binds to

= programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) on natural killer (NK) cells, T cells, and B cells and

19 down-regulates their activity.

* When PD-L1 binds to PD-1 on an activated T-cell, it converts it to an exhausted T-cell.

Exhausted T-cells primarily express immunoinhibitory molecules and are unable to effectively
24 destroy cancer cells with perforins/granzymes (Choice E) or to secrete immunostimulatory
cytokines (eg, IL-2). In order to counter the overexpression of PD-L1 by certain tumors,

27 patients can receive immunotherapy medications that block PD-1 (eg, pembrolizumab) or PD-
L1 (eg, atezolizumab), which restores anti-tumor T-cell activity.

Other common adaptations cancer cells employ to avoid immunodetection include:

2 A neoantigen expression on the tumor cell surface.

5 ¢ Induction of T-cell anergy: Tumor cells eliminate costimulatory surface molecules

7 (CD80/86) required for T-cell activation; this induces T-cell anergy (ie, a dormant state).
