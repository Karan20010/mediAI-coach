released into the circulation throughout the day. Adalimumab is given as a subcutaneous
injection but does not form insoluble complexes at the injection site.

(Choice C) Enterohepatic recirculation of certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents (eg,
irinotecan) can lead to increased exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the agent and significant
gastrointestinal toxicity. However, monoclonal antibodies do not undergo enterohepatic
recirculation.

(Choice D) Adalimumab and other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are eliminated primarily
by degradation via receptor-mediated endocytosis in the reticuloendothelial system. Renal
elimination of adalimumab can lead to increased drug clearance in patients with protein-losing
glomerular disorders but otherwise does not significantly affect pharmacokinetics.

(Choice E) Cytochrome P-450 enzyme inducers (eg, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital)
can cause accelerated clearance of drugs that are metabolized primarily in the liver.
Adalimumab does not undergo metabolism by the P-450 system.

Educational objective:
Adalimumab is a recombinant human IgG that binds tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha).
Antidrug antibodies can develop against adalimumab (or other immunoglobulin-based anti-
