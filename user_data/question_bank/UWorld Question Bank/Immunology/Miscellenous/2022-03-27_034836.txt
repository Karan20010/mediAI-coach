Question Id: 18609

This patient with a traumatic injury to the right eye has developed granulomatous
inflammation of both the injured and noninjured eye, a condition known as sympathetic
ophthalmia. This occurs when there is a robust T-cell response to previously sequestered
antigens in the eye, an area that displays immune privilege.

Certain anatomic sites (eg, eyes, testes) have inherent immune privilege, in which
inflammation is inhibited to limit consequent organ dysfunction. Self-antigens located in sites
with immune privilege can be recognized by T cells that escape negative selection in the
thymus. Therefore, if these antigens are released into the lymphatic system through trauma, T
cells may recognize these antigens as foreign and mount a response that can occur in both
the injured eye and the contralateral eye.

Because of this potential sight-threatening condition, if an eye is severely injured with no
prognosis for recovery of vision, it is surgically removed (ie, enucleated) to prevent blindness
in the uninjured eye. However, in patients whose vision is likely to recover, treatment is
focused on decreasing inflammation (eg, corticosteroids) should the condition develop.

(Choice A) Herpes zoster reactivation can cause granulomatous keratouveitis (ie, anterior
chamber inflammation). However, herpes zoster typically reactivates in a single ganglion,
