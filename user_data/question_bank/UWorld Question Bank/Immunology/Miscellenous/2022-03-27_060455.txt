This patient's recurring skin and mucosal infections, as well as the absence of purulence, are
highly suggestive of leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD). LAD is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by the absence of CD18 antigens, which are necessary for the
formation of integrins. Integrins are essential for leukocyte adhesion to endothelial surfaces
and migration into peripheral tissues in response to infection or inflammation.

The failure of leukocyte chemotaxis results in characteristic LAD findings, including recurrent
skin and mucosal infections (often due to Staphylococcus aureus or gram-negative rods)
and periodontal disease. LAD-related infections are notable for lack of purulence because of
the absence of leukocytes in peripheral tissues. Wound healing is also impaired, which can
result in late umbilical cord separation (age >3 weeks).

Peripheral leukocytosis and neutrophilia are typical, particularly during active infection,
because leukocytes cannot migrate out of the blood vessels.

(Choice A) Deficiencies of T-cell-mediated immunity (eg, HIV, severe combined
immunodeficiency) increase the risk of infection following live vaccines. T-cell deficiencies
present with severe opportunistic infections in early infancy but have normal CD18 antigens.

(Choice B) Terminal complement deficiency (C5b-CQ) results in an inability to form the

membrane attack complex and predisposes to recurrent Neisseria infections. CD18 is not
