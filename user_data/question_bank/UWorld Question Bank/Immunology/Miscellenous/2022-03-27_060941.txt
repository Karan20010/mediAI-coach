(Choice A) C3a is a split product anaphylatoxin derived from C3. It stimulates the release of
histamine by mast cells, which increases vascular permeability and vasodilation.

(Choice B) Fibroblast growth factor has a variety of proliferative effects, including stimulation
of angiogenesis and fibroblast proliferation during formation of granulation tissue. It does not
have a primary role in the formation of granulomas.

(Choice C) Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor induces stem cell
differentiation into monocytes and other granulocytes (eg, neutrophils, eosinophils). However,
it does not induce granuloma formation.

(Choice D) IL-4 is a cytokine that stimulates the differentiation of naive CD4 T cells into the
Th2 subset, which plays an important role in humoral immunity and allergic reactions by
stimulating B-cell proliferation and isotype switching to IgE.

(Choice E) Interferon-alpha is a primary mediator of the immune response to virus-infected
cells. However, in contrast to interferon-gamma, it limits macrophage proliferation and does
not drive granuloma formation.

Educational objective:
T helper subtype 1 cells release interferon-gamma, leading to the activation of macrophages, a
