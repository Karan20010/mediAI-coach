exposure to the same antigen can lead to further allergen priming, worsening symptoms over
time.

(Choice B) Complement activation occurs in type III hypersensitivity reactions, in which
immune complexes deposit in the basement membrane of small blood vessels in the skin,
kidneys, or joints, resulting in vasculitis. Complement does not play a significant role in type |
hypersensitivity.

(Choice D) Interferon gamma is secreted by Th1 cells, which activates macrophages and,
along with IL-2, stimulates CD8- cytotoxic cells. It inhibits, rather than enhances, the Th2 cell

activity that drives type 1 hypersensitivity reactions (eg, allergic rhinitis).

Educational objective:

Sensitization to aeroallergens occurs when inhaled antigens induce T-helper (Th) cells to
differentiate into Th2 cells. Th2 cells then promote B-cell maturation and isotype class
switching to IgE.
