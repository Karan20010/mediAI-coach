A 58-year-old woman comes to the emergency department due to abdominal discomfort and
bloating. Physical examination reveals ascites. Abdominal ultrasonography shows a mass in
the left ovary, and subsequent paracentesis reveals malignant cells. Surgical excision of the
mass is performed. Histopathology shows high-grade serous carcinoma composed of atypical
cells with pleomorphic nuclei and mitotic figures. Large numbers of T cells are present in the
tumor stroma; further evaluation shows the tumor expresses PD-1 ligands that interact with the
PD-1 receptor on the infiltrating T cells. Which of the following is most likely occurring in the
tumor microenvironment as a result of this interaction?

A. Decreased IL-10 and tumor growth factor beta release (16%)
B. Decreased reactive nitrogen species synthesis (6%)

Y/Y C. Decreased IL-2 production (55%)
D. Increased dendritic cell activation (4%)

E. Increased T-cell perforin release (16%)
