(Choice B) Marjolin ulcer is an aggressive, ulcerating squamous cell carcinoma that presents
in an area of previously traumatized, chronically inflamed, or scarred skin. Malignant
transformation often occurs long after the initial trauma, usually >10 years later. Histology
would show dysplastic keratinocytes and keratinization.

(Choice C) The remodeling phase of wound healing is characterized by fibrosis (scar
formation) and starts the second week after injury. During this phase, active fibroblasts
synthesize collagen, elastin, and other components of the connective tissue matrix.

(Choice D) The inflammatory phase of wound healing consists of the movement of
neutrophils (within the first 24 hours) and macrophages (within 2-3 days) to the damaged area,
with phagocytosis of necrotic debris and bacterial contaminants. Persistent neutrophil activity
in a wound would result in an abscess and/or pus drainage rather than granuloma formation.

Educational objective:

Granulomatous inflammation is a form of chronic inflammation characterized by aggregates of
activated macrophages that assume an epithelioid appearance. Persistent granulomatous
inflammation with subsequent fibrosis can cause organ dysfunction, which is seen in a number
of granulomatous diseases.
