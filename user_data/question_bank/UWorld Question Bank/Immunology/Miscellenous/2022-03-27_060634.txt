(Choice B) IL-3 is secreted by both Th1 and Th2 cells and promotes the growth and
differentiation of bone marrow stem cells.
(Choice D) IL-5 is secreted by activated Th2 cells and stimulates the growth and

differentiation of eosinophils. However, IL-5 promotes the class switching of B-cell
immunoglobulin synthesis to IgA rather than to IgE and is a less important therapeutic target
for asthma than IL-4.

(Choice E) Interferon-gamma secreted by Th1 cells activates macrophages and, along with
IL-2, stimulates CD8- cytotoxic T cells. It also inhibits the differentiation of Th2 cells.

(Choice F) Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-§) is involved in tissue regeneration and
repair. It can be produced by T lymphocytes, platelets, macrophages, endothelial cells,
smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes.

Educational objective:

An excess of Th2 cell activity relative to Th1 cell activity may underlie the pathogenesis of

asthma. In the asthma sensitization phase, inhaled antigens stimulate Th2 cells to secrete IL-

4 and IL-13, which together promote B-lymphocyte class switching for IgE synthesis, leading to

mast cell priming. Th2 cells also secrete IL-5, which activates eosinophils. ctivate V
