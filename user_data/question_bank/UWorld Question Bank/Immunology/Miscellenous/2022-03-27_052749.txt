Binding the modified T-cell to its tumor antigen stimulates the release of inflammatory
cytokines and promotes destruction of the cancer cell. The most serious adverse effect is a
life-threatening cytokine storm, which must be countered with urgent anti-IL-6 treatment
(eg, tocilizumab) to prevent death. In addition, anti-CD19 therapy in particular can also cause
hypogammaglobulinemia due to destruction of healthy B cells/plasma cells.

(Choice A) Autoimmune endocrinopathy sometimes occurs with immune checkpoint inhibitor
therapy, which targets surface molecules (eg, PD-1, CTLA-4) on cytotoxic T cells. CD19 is
only expressed on B-cells, not T-cells.

(Choice B) Graft versus host disease occurs when allogeneic (non-self) immune cells attack
host tissue. It does not occur with autologous immune cells because these cells are drawn
from the patient and adequately differentiate self from non-self.

(Choice D) Myelofibrosis, a chronic myeloproliferative disorder, is associated with exposure to
ionizing radiation and toxic chemicals. However, CAR-T cell therapy is not associated with
myelofibrosis. In addition, risk of secondary malignancy after CAR-T cell therapy appears to
be low overall.

(Choice E) Chemotherapy often causes transient myelosuppression due to destruction of
