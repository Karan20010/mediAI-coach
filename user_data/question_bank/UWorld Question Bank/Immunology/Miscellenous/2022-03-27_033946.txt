Apoptosis can be triggered by a number of mechanisms, including deprivation of growth
factors, DNA damage, intracellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, mediation by cytotoxic
T lymphocytes, and activation of receptors in the TNF receptor family (such as Fas). Fas
receptors initiate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis through a cytoplasmic component known
as the death domain. Upon binding Fas ligand (FasL), the receptors trimerize, allowing their
death domains to form a binding site for an adapter protein called Fas-associated death
domain (FADD). Receptor-bound FADD then stimulates the activation of initiator caspases (8
& 10) that begin an activation cascade culminating in the activation of executioner caspases (3
& 6). These initiate the terminal processes of apoptosis, including cleavage of DNA,
fragmentation of the nucleus, organelle autodigestion, and plasma membrane blebbing.

The Fas receptor is expressed on T-lymphocytes and plays an important role in the
pathogenesis of numerous diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Once
activated, T lymphocytes begin to express FasL, which can bind to Fas on the same cell or
adjacent lymphocytes. During initial clonal expansion, activated T lymphocytes are resistant to
Fas-induced apoptosis. However, they become more sensitive with progressive stimulation.

In the constant presence of stimulating self-antigens, activated T lymphocytes eventually
undergo apoptosis in a process known as activation-induced cell death. Mutations involving
