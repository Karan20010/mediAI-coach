(Choice B) Mast cells are primarily responsible for immediate (type |) hypersensitivity

14 reactions. On reexposure, allergens bind to allergen-specific IgEs on mast cells, causing
16 immediate degranulation and release of vasoactive peptides (eg, histamine), resulting in
17 urticaria and, when severe, anaphylaxis. Onset is rapid (minutes), unlike this patient's delayed
. . (48-hr) response. Furthermore, individual wheals of urticaria resolve within 24 hours, rather
+ 20 than days.

+ 2 (Choice C) Neutrophils phagocytose bacteria and fungi and kill them by generating reactive

oxygen species (NADPH oxidase) and hypochlorous acid (myeloperoxidase). Although
25 neutrophils play a role in defense against cutaneous infections (eg, cellulitis, which is painful
rather than pruritic), this patient's rash is more consistent with contact dermatitis.

(Choice D) Immunoglobulins produced by plasma cells are responsible for type |! and II!

+ 30 hypersensitivity reactions. ACD does not involve plasma cells or antibodies.

+ 32 (Choice E) Regulatory T cells are CD4- lymphocytes that play an inhibitory role in the immune
= response. They secrete cytokines (eg, interleukin-10) that inhibit macrophage function and

35 antagonize proinflammatory cytokines (eg, interferon gamma). This anti-inflammatory effect is

a important in suppressing autoimmune diseases.
