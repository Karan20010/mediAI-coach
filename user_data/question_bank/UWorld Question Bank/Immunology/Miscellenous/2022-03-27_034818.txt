(Choice D) MHC class II molecules consist of two polypeptide chains, alpha and beta. MHC
class Il molecules are present on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, including B-
lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells of the viscera, and Langerhans cells of the skin.
Foreign antigens taken up by phagocytosis are degraded in lysosomes and presented to CD4-
T-helper cells in association with MHC II.

Educational objective:

CD8- cells recognize foreign antigens presented with MHC class | proteins. Each MHC class |
molecule consists of a heavy chain and a B,-microglobulin.
