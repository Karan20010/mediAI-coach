(Choice B) Immunoglobulins are secreted by plasma cells, which have an eccentric nucleus,
perinuclear paleness (large Golgi apparatus), and spoke-wheel chromatin. Although
immunoglobins cannot typically be visualized on light microscopy, immunoglobulin inclusions
can sometimes be seen in plasma cell malignancies such as multiple myeloma (characterized
by anemia, hypercalcemia, bone pain, and renal insufficiency).

(Choice C) Eosinophils generate and release major basic protein, which is the core
constituent of eosinophilic granules; it acts as a cytotoxin and helminthotoxin and mediates
epithelial damage, exfoliation, and bronchospasm in hypersensitivity diseases. Eosinophils
have a bilobed nucleus and stain intensely pink.

(Choice E) Ribosomes generate proteins from messenger RNA; they can be visualized by
electron microscopy but usually cannot be seen on light microscopy. However, ribosomal
aggregates can sometimes be seen as basophilic stippling in patients with thalassemia or
alcoholism.

(Choice F) Viral capsids are usually bound to viral genomes and shed in the cytoplasm prior
to viral replication. This typically cannot be seen on light microscopy. Atypical lymphocytes
are not infected by virus; they react to infected cells.
