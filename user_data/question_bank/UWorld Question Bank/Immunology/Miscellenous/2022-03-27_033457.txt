leg. He has not eaten any new foods or changed detergents, soaps, or lotions. On further
questioning, the patient recalls that he recently worked on a repair job in an unmaintained,
wooded area. He had atopic dermatitis as a child but no other significant illnesses. On
physical examination, he appears uncomfortable and is constantly scratching his leg. His
lungs are clear bilaterally and his heart sounds are normal. Examination of his right leg shows
