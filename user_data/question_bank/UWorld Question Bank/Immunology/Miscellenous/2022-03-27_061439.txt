A 34-year-old woman comes to the office for tuberculosis evaluation. The patient was advised
to have tuberculosis testing after her father, who came to visit from Haiti a week ago and had
been living with her, was found to have active pulmonary tuberculosis. She has no history of
tuberculosis or any other chronic medical conditions and takes no medications. Tuberculin
skin testing is performed and results 48 hours later are negative. Eight weeks later, the patient
returns for follow-up and says she feels healthy and has had no fever, cough, shortness of
breath, or weight loss. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Repeat tuberculin skin
testing reveals significant skin induration around the injection site at 48 hours. Chest
radiograph reveals no parenchymal opacities, pleural effusion, or enlarged lymph nodes.

responsible for this patient's skin findings?
