: (Choice C) Host B-cell sensitization against donor antigens results in a humoral antibody

6 response and is sometimes involved in acute rejection. Histology is expected to show

; deposition of complement (eg, C4d), neutrophilic infiltrate, and necrotizing vasculitis; this

patient's mononuclear (lymphocytic) infiltrate is consistent with a cell-mediated T-cell

response. Although it can occur acutely, the humoral response tends to be more involved in

chronic rejection, which occurs months to years following transplant.

(Choice E) Preformed antibodies against graft ABO or other antigens can lead to hyperacute
graft rejection. Because the antibodies are already present in the recipient circulation, there is
rapid response against the donor graft, leading to arterial fibrinoid necrosis and vascular
thrombosis with graft mottling and cyanosis. Thorough crossmatching prior to transplant
makes hyperacute rejection a rare occurrence.

Educational objective:

Organ rejection can be hyperacute, acute, or chronic. Acute rejection most often occurs within
weeks or up to 6 months after transplant and is predominantly cell-mediated, involving
sensitization of host T lymphocytes against donor MHC antigens. There is typically graft
dysfunction with histology showing a dense, mononuclear (ie, lymphocytic) infiltrate.
