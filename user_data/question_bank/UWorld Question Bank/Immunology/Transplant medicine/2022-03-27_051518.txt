(Choice A) B lymphocytes are the main cell type involved in the humoral immune system and
the production of circulating antibodies.

(Choices B and D) Basophils and antigen-presenting cells such as monocyte-derived
macrophages interact with T cells to control the immune response but are not directly
responsible for IFN-y release.

(Choices C and E) Eosinophils help eradicate parasitic infections (eg, helminths), whereas
neutrophils are involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria and other pathogens.

Educational objective:

Interferon-gamma (IFN-y) release assays test for latent tuberculosis infection by measuring the
amount of IFN-y released by T lymphocytes when exposed to antigens unique to
Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
