typically occurs <6 months after transplant but can occur later in a patient in whom

posttransplant immunosuppression has been stopped.

an

(Choice B) Glomerular injury in chronic rejection is predominantly ischemic, and crescent
formation is not typically observed. Crescents develop mainly in anti-glomerular basement
membrane antibody—mediated, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibody—associated, or
immune complex—mediated glomerulonephritis.

(Choice D) Muddy brown casts can be seen with acute tubular necrosis, which usually
manifests as acute (rather than gradual) kidney injury. Tubular hypertrophy may be present
during the recovery phase. These findings are not typical of chronic rejection.

(Choice E) Vascular fibrinoid necrosis with capillary thrombotic occlusion occurs in
hyperacute rejection, which is a rapid and profound form of antibody-mediated rejection
caused by preformed antibodies to graft antigens. Chronic rejection is a more gradual
antibody-mediated process resulting from sensitization that occurs after a transplant has taken
place.

Educational objective:
Chronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with
