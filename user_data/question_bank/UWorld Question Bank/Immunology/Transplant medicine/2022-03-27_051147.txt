In normal T cells, calcineurin is a protein phosphatase that is activated upon stimulation of the
appropriate cell receptor. Once activated, calcineurin dephosphorylates nuclear factor of
activated T cells (NFAT), which allows NFAT to enter the nucleus and bind to an interleukin-2
(IL-2) promoter. IL-2 stimulates the growth and differentiation of T cells and is an important
component of the immune response. Cyclosporine and tacrolimus, 2 of the more commonly
used immunosuppressants in transplant patients, inhibit calcineurin activation.

(Choice A) Bcl-2 is an apoptosis inhibitor. When Bcl-2 is overexpressed, cell death is
delayed and an accumulation of indolent malignant cells occurs. Bcl-2 involvement has been
implicated in follicular cell lymphomas, most of which have a characteristic t(14;18)
translocation. Bcl-2 inhibition would not be specific to T cells.

(Choice C) E-cadherin is a transmembrane glycoprotein that orchestrates epithelial cell
adhesion. If this glycoprotein is lost, cell clusters may be disrupted. The loss of e-cadherin is
associated with metastasis and is a predictor of disease progression in some cancers.

(Choice D) Neurofibromin is a tumor suppressor protein encoded by the NF7 gene on
chromosome 17. Neurofibromin can protect against cancer as it is a key suppressor of Ras,
one of the more powerful activators of cell growth and proliferation.
