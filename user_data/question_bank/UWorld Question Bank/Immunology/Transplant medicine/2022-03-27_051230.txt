smoke. Physical examination shows scattered bilateral rales and end-expiratory squeaks.
Cardiac auscultation reveals no murmurs or additional sounds. Spirometry demonstrates
markedly decreased FEV1 compared with findings 6 months prior, although the FVC remains
largely unchanged. Chronic lung transplant rejection is suspected, and bronchoscopy with
transbronchial biopsy is planned. Histopathology is most likely to show injury predominantly
involving which of the following structures?
