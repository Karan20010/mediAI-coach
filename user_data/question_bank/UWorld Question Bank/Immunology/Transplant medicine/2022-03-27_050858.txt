Azathioprine metabolism

HGPRT
Azathioprine —————» 6-mercaptopurine ——————» 6-TG active metabolites
(inhibition of cellular proliferation)

Allopurinol > Xanthine PI
Febuxostat oxidase TPMT
Inactive metabolites

“Genetic deficiency of TPMT is common
6-TG = 6-thioguanine, HGPRT = hypoxanthine-guanine phosphonbosyltransferase,
TPMT = thiopurine methyltransferase Ouworid
