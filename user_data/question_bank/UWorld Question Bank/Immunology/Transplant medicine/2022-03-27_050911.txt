purine synthesis pathway and also act as false TRESS that incorporate into and disrupt

DNA and RNA. Both the de novo and salvage purine synthesis pathways are disrupted,
resulting in relatively nonspecific hematopoietic suppression.

(Choice C) Prednisone and other glucocorticoids inhibit NF-kB to decrease the transcription
of IL-2 and many other cytokines. These drugs have wide-ranging effects that suppress the
function of all leukocyte cell lines.

(Choice D) Sirolimus inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to interrupt IL-2
signal transduction and provide relatively specific lymphocyte suppression.

(Choice E) Tacrolimus and cyclosporine inhibit calcineurin to block transcription of IL-2.
These drugs provide relatively specific lymphocyte suppression and are the mainstay of
therapy for preventing organ transplant rejection.

Educational objective:

Mycophenolate is an immunosuppression drug that inhibits inosine 5'-monophosphate

dehydrogenase in the de novo purine synthesis pathway. It provides relatively specific
suppression of lymphocyte proliferation, largely because activated lymphocytes lack an
established purine salvage pathway that is present in other hematopoietic cell lines.
