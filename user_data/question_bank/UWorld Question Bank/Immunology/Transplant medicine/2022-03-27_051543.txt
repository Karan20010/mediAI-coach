generally develop lymph node swelling (lymphadenopathy) in the draining lymph node. In
addition, the release of large quantities of cytokines frequently causes pain and inflammation
in that area.

(Choice A) Atypical B-cell proliferation is seen in many forms of lymphoma. However, the
lymphadenopathy is usually painless and not associated with erythema because B-cell
proliferation without antigen stimulation is not associated with significant inflammatory cytokine
release.

(Choice B) Granulomatous lymphadenitis can be seen in noninfectious (eg, sarcoidosis) or
infectious (eg, tularemia, catscratch disease, cryptococcal) diseases. This patient with a
recent puncture wound in the foot and evidence of inflammatory lymphadenopathy in a
draining lymph node is far more likely to have a typical bacterial infection than an atypical
granulomatous infection.

(Choice C) Necrotizing lymphadenitis (eg, buboes) in the groin can be caused by certain
serovars of Chlamydia trachomatis. However, this infection is typically seen in tropical and
subtropical regions and would not be associated with a recent foot puncture wound.

(Choice D) T cells primarily reside in the lymph node paracortex. Paracortical hyperplasia is
