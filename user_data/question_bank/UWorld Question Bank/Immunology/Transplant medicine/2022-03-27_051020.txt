This patient most likely has graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a condition that usually
occurs after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. However, GVHD can also occur
following transplantation of organs rich in lymphocytes (eg, liver) or transfusion of non-

irradiated blood.

Patients affected by GVHD are generally severely immunodeficient due to the primary disease
process or as a result of immunosuppressive medications. This allows immunocompetent
donor T cells from the graft to survive and migrate into host tissues, where they recognize
host MHC antigens as foreign and become sensitized. On activation, donor CD4- and CD8&: T

cells (not B cells) participate in host cell destruction (Choice A).

Any organ may be a target of GVHD, but the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract are the
most frequently affected. Early signs of GVHD include a diffuse maculopapular rash that has a
predilection for the palms and soles and may desquamate in severe cases. Gl tract
involvement causes diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and abdominal pain. Liver damage will
manifest as abnormal liver function tests. In this case, the donated liver would not be
significantly affected as the donor T cells perceive the liver as self.

(Choices C and D) Acute and chronic graft rejections occur following host T and B cell

sensitization against graft MHC antigens. The resulting immune response leads to graft failure
