Educational objective:

Chronic renal allograft rejection manifests months to years after a transplant and presents with
worsening hypertension and a gradual decline in renal function. It involves a chronic cell-
mediated and antibody-mediated response against donor antigens and leads to obliterative
vascular wall thickening, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis. The process is usually
irreversible and eventually leads to graft failure.
