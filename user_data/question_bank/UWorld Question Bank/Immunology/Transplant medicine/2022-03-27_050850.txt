Mycophenolate is an immunosuppression drug used to prevent organ transplant rejection. It

functions via the inhibition of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an

enzyme in the de novo purine synthesis pathway. The utility of mycophenolate as an

immunosuppressant is aided by its relatively specific suppression of lymphocyte proliferation

compared with other hematopoietic cell lines (eg, neutrophils, erythrocytes). This relative

lymphocyte specificity is driven by 2 factors:

¢ Activated lymphocytes have a nearly absent purine salvage pathway and therefore are

mostly dependent on de novo purine synthesis. Other hematopoietic cell lines have a
more robust purine salvage pathway and can better compensate for inhibition of the de
novo pathway.

¢ There are 2 subtypes of the IMPDH enzyme: Lymphocytes primarily contain type 2
IMPDH, whereas other cell lines contain a greater proportion of type 1. Mycophenolate
binds to and inhibits type 2 IMPDH with a higher affinity than type 1.

Common adverse effects of mycophenolate include lymphopenia and gastrointestinal
disturbances (eg, diarrhea).

(Choice A) Azathioprine produces active metabolites that inhibit an enzyme in the de novo
