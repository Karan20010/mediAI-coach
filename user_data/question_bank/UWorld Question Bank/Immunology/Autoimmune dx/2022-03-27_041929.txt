This young patient has pleuritis (chest pain worse with breathing, pleural rub), arthralgias,

fever, and an erythematous rash on the cheeks. This presentation is concerning for systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by autoantibodies
that bind self-antigens. Particular autoantibodies that are useful in the diagnosis of SLE

include:

1. Antinuclear antibodies are found in virtually all patients with SLE but also in many other
autoimmune disorders (ie, high sensitivity, low specificity).

2. Anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE, but only
approximately 60% of patients have high titers (ie, low sensitivity, high specificity).

3. Anti-Smith antibodies (ie, antibodies against small nuclear ribonucleoproteins) are
present in 20%-30% of patients but are also highly specific.

Common laboratory abnormalities include low C3 and C4 levels (due to activation of
complement) and elevated inflammatory markers (eg, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate). Hematologic abnormalities can include anemia, leukopenia, and
thrombocytopenia, which occur due to chronic inflammatory effects on bone marrow and
autoimmune hemolysis. Renal involvement can result in elevated serum creatinine,
proteinuria, hematuria, or red cell casts visible on urinalysis.
