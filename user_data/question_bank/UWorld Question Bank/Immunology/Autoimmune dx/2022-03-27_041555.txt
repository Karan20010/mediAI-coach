Educational objective:

Atopic dermatitis presents with dry, erythematous patches or papules that are caused in part
by a Th2-skewed immune response. Th2 cytokines (eg, IL-4, IL-13) stimulate IgE production,
suppress epidermal barrier component expression, and impair host immune responses against

secondary microbial infections.
