(Choice E) Platelet antibodies can often cause thrombocytopenia by binding to platelets.
Neither these autoantibodies, nor thrombocytopenia is known to cause acute renal failure.

(Choice F) Antimitochondrial antibodies are seen in primary biliary cholangitis (cirrhosis).

Educational objective:

Necrotizing vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract (causing nasal ulcerations,
sinusitis, hemoptysis) and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis—producing a variable
degree of renal failure—is characteristic of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener). This
disease is associated with C-ANCAs, which may target neutrophil proteinase 3.
