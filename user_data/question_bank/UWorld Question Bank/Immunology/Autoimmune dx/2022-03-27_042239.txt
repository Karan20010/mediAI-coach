and type 1 diabetes in infancy.
(Choice A) Impaired differentiation of B cells into plasma cells is the hallmark of combined
variable immunodeficiency, which typically presents after puberty with recurrent infections (eg,
sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal) and autoimmune disease. Patients have dramatically reduced
(not increased) serum immunoglobulins due to a lack of functioning plasma cells.

(Choice C) T-helper cell type 17 (Th17) dysfunction is associated with hyperimmunoglobulin
E (Job) syndrome. Th17 cells assist in neutrophil recruitment and are crucial for pathogen
defense at mucosal sites. Although patients with Job syndrome have eczema and recurrent
infection (eg, staphylococcal abscesses), they do not have FOXP3 mutation.

(Choice D) Mutations in CD40 ligand or CD40 prevent activated CD4 cells from triggering
activated B cells to undergo immunoglobulin isotype (class) switching; this results in
overproduction of IgM (hyper-IgM syndrome). Patients have recurrent infections and chronic
diarrhea but not FOXP3 mutation.

(Choice E) Developing T cells that bind too strongly to self MHC die by apoptosis as part of
negative selection; therefore, reduced negative (not positive) selection would lead to

autoimmunity. In contrast, positive selection provides survival signals to developing T cells
that bind to self MHC with moderate affinity.
