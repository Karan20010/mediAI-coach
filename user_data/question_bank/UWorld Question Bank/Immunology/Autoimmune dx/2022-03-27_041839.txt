Hematologic abnormalities are common in SLE. The most common cause of anemia is
chronic inflammation (anemia of chronic disease); however, pancytopenia (as seen in this
patient) can also occur due to autoantibodies against blood cell antigens (ie, type Il
hypersensitivity). Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in SLE is caused by IgG antibodies against
erythrocytes; manifestations include spherocytosis, a positive direct Coombs test, and
extravascular hemolysis. Antiplatelet antibodies in SLE can cause thrombocytopenia
resembling immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Leukopenia can also occur, primarily due to
antibody-mediated destruction of neutrophils.

Lupus nephritis is caused by immune complex deposition (ie, type III hypersensitivity) in
the mesangium, subendothelial, and/or subepithelial spaces. Histopathology is variable but
diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (class IV) is the most common pattern.

4 This patient has chronic migratory arthralgias, pancytopenia, and evidence of
glomerulonephritis (ie, proteinuria, red cell casts). These findings are suspicious for systemic
7 lupus erythematosus (SLE), an idiopathic autoimmune disorder that is most common in
8 women.
