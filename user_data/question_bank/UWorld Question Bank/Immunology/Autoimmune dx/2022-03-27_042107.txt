This patient's symptoms and biopsy findings are suggestive of acute serum sickness, a
condition caused by tissue deposition of circulating immune complexes (type III
hypersensitivity). The most common manifestations include fever, pruritic skin rash, and
arthralgias that begin 7-14 days after exposure to an antigen. Lymphadenopathy and
proteinuria may also occur in some patients. Histologic examination of affected tissues
typically shows small vessel vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis and intense neutrophil
infiltration. Deposition of IgG and/or IgM complement-fixing antibodies results in localized

complement consumption and hypocomplementemia (decreased serum C3 levels).

Serum sickness can occur following administration of antigenic heterologous proteins such as
chimeric monoclonal antibodies (eg, rituximab and infliximab) or nonhuman
immunoglobulins (eg, venom antitoxins). A serum sicknessâ€”like reaction is also associated
with the use of certain nonprotein drugs (eg, penicillin, cefaclor, and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole).

(Choice A) Anergy to cutaneously applied Candida antigens would be indicative of depressed
cell-mediated immunity. Cell-mediated immunity is involved in the pathogenesis of type IV
(delayed) hypersensitivity.

Choice C) Increased serum IgE levels are typically found in atopic individuals prone to IgE-
Block Time Elapse
