(Choice B) Antibodies to streptolysin O indicate recent streptococcal infection and are useful
in the diagnosis of certain immune sequelae (eg, glomerulonephritis, rheumatic fever). This
patient has arthralgias, but no other major features of rheumatic fever (ie, carditis,
subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum, Sydenham chorea).

(Choice C) Acute cervicitis is a common cause of fever in young, sexually active women.
Evaluation commonly includes nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) for organisms such as
gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Although disseminated gonorrhea can cause
arthralgias and rash, pleuritis is not typical.

(Choice D) Rheumatoid factor is an IgM antibody directed against the Fc portion of human
IgG. It is classically associated with rheumatoid arthritis, although it may also be seen in other
autoimmune diseases (including SLE) and is nonspecific. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause
arthralgias and lung involvement, but rash is unexpected and joint swelling is usually
prominent.

(Choice E) Nontreponemal serologic tests (eg, RPR, VDRL) are frequently used to screen for
syphilis. Although secondary syphilis can manifest with synovitis and rash, it typically involves
the palms and soles and pleural involvement is rare.
