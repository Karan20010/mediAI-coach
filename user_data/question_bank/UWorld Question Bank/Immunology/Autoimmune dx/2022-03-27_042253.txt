Educational objective:

FOXP%3 is a transcriptional regulator protein that is required for the development of regulatory T
cells; it triggers production of cytokines (eg, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta) and ligands
(eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) that suppress immune activation. FOXP3 mutations
result in immune dysregulation marked by excessive immunoglobulin production and the
development of autoimmunity.
