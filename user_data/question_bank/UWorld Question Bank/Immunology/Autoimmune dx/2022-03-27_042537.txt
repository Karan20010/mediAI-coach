Nasal mucosal ulcerations and glomerulonephritis are most characteristic of granulomatosis
with polyangiitis (Wegener). Cytoplasmic-staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (c-
ANCAs) are virtually pathognomonic for granulomatosis with polyangiitis, with a better than
90% specificity and sensitivity. Proteinase 3-ANCA (also known as c-ANCA) may also be
useful as a quantitative measure of disease activity.

(Choice A) Goodpasture syndrome is sometimes called anti-glomerular basement membrane
(GBM) antibody disease. Presenting clinical manifestations of Goodpasture syndrome are
hemoptysis, radiographic focal pulmonary consolidations, and a glomerulonephritis that may
rapidly progress to renal failure. Upper respiratory tract ulceration is not characteristic.

(Choice B) Smooth muscle cell antibodies are commonly seen in patients with autoimmune
hepatitis.

(Choice D) Antierythrocyte antibodies can produce hemolysis of an intravascular and/or
extravascular type. Hemoglobinemia from intravascular hemolysis can end in acute renal
failure, although this is predominantly seen after transfusion reactions only when other
conditions, such as hypovolemia and/or acidemia, coexist. Hemolytic anemia would not cause
isolated ulceration of mucosa.
