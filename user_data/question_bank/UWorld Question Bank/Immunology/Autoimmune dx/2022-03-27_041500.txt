This patient has atopic dermatitis, an inflammatory condition characterized by acute
exacerbations of dry, pruritic, erythematous patches, papules, and/or vesicles. As in this
patient, flexural regions (eg, antecubital and popliteal fossae) are commonly affected in adults.

The pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis involves immune dysregulation and genetically mediated
skin barrier dysfunction (eg, filaggrin mutation). The epidermal dysfunction increases
cutaneous exposure to environmental allergens, which induce a Th2-predominant immune
response. Key Th2 cytokines that trigger acute inflammation in atopic dermatitis are IL-4 and
IL-13, and mechanisms include the following:

¢ Stimulation of plasma cell IgE production, which facilitates allergen sensitization and
inflammation

¢ Suppressed expression of epidermal barrier components, which enhances Staphylococcus
aureus colonization and inflammation

¢ Inhibition of Th1-type immune response and antimicrobial peptide production, which
facilitate secondary microbial infections that complicate atopic dermatitis

(Choice B) IL-8 and C3b are involved in neutrophil migration and activation in bacterial
infections. IL-8 attracts neutrophils to infected areas, whereas C3b opsonizes pathogens for
