Educational objective:

Sjégren syndrome is characterized by autoimmune inflammation of exocrine glands (eg,
salivary, lacrimal, vaginal). Patients typically have severe dry mouth (xerostomia) due to
reduced saliva production, which can lead to an increased rate of dental caries and other oral
infections (eg, thrush) because of the loss of protective factors in saliva. Biopsy of the salivary
glands shows a lymphocytic infiltrate, often with germinal centers.
