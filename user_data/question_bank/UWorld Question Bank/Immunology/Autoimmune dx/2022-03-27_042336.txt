6 (released by mast cells and eosinophils). These medications are used as adjunct therapy for
z allergic rhinitis and asthma and can help reduce mucus secretion, edema, and

(Choice B) Topical corticosteroids decrease, not increase, dendritic cell populations, in part

by inducing dendritic cell apoptosis. These antigen-presenting cells activate naive T cells and
are thought to play a role in initiating inflammation in atopic dermatitis.

(Choice C) Keratinocyte apoptosis induced by ultraviolet phototherapy is effective for treating
psoriasis, which causes plaques with silvery scales on the extensor elbows, knees, and gluteal
cleft (not the antecubital fossae). Phototherapy is also sometimes used for refractory atopic
dermatitis (ie, not first-line therapy), but functions primarily by inducing T-cell apoptosis.
(Choice E) IL-4 normally stimulates B-cell production of IgE and is suppressed with topical
corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids also increase CD40-ligand expression on T cells,
which stimulates IgE production to a greater degree than IL-4 suppression, and the net effect
is a rise in IgE.
