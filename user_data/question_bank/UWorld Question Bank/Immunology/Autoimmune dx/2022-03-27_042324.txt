This patient has pruritic lichenified plaques on the bilateral antecubital fossae, findings
consistent with atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is an inflammatory condition caused by
genetically mediated epidermal barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation favoring a Th2-
skewed response. Patients typically have a family history and comorbid atopic conditions (eg,
asthma, allergic rhinitis), as in this patient. First-line therapy is topical corticosteroids.

Corticosteroids bind to cytoplasmic receptors and translocate to the nucleus, where they act
primarily by inhibiting transcription of genes encoding inflammatory mediators. Specific
mechanisms include the following:

¢ | Local tissue production of proinflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes through the
inhibition of phospholipase A,

¢ | Synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-4, IL-13)

¢ + Production of anti-inflammatory mediators

In addition, corticosteroids act on nonimmune cells and can cause impaired wound healing
due to reduced fibroblast growth. They also reduce epithelial proliferation and type | collagen
synthesis in the dermis, which can lead to skin atrophy with chronic use.

Choice A) Leukotriene receptor blockers (eq, montelukast) block the effects of leukotrienes
