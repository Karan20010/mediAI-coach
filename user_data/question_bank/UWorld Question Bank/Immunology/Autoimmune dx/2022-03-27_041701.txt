This patient with cough, shortness of breath, and fatigue has multiple findings characteristic
of granulomatous inflammation in sarcoidosis, including the following:

¢ Elevated serum calcium due to increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production by activated
macrophages

¢ Mediastinal and hilar adenopathy

¢ Granulomas (noncaseating) with multinucleated giant cells and no microorganisms on lung
biopsy

Glucocorticoids are commonly used as initial therapy in patients with sarcoidosis because of
their ability to reduce inflammation, improving symptoms and limiting end-organ damage
while having relatively minor adverse effects (eg, weight gain, glucose intolerance) with short
term use. Glucocorticoids improve sarcoidosis symptoms by decreasing transcription of
proinflammatory genes, leading to reduced activation of lymphocytes and macrophages with
decreased expression of cytokines necessary for granuloma formation (eg, IL-1, interferon-
gamma) (Choice D).

Glucocorticoids also impair neutrophil margination, extravasation, and migration to

inflammatory sites by reducing adhesion molecule expression on neutrophils (eg, L selectin)
