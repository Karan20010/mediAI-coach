Henoch-Schonlein purpura, or IgA vasculitis, classically presents with palpable purpura, with or
without abdominal pain, arthralgias, and renal involvement. Histopathologic examination of the

inflammation, and nuclear debris (ie, leukocytoclastic vasculitis). Immunofluorescence reveals
deposition of IgA and C3.
