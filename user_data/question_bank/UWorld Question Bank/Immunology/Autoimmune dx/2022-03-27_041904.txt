(Choice A) Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory arthritis involving the spine and
sacroiliac joints. It presents with low back pain and stiffness. Common associated features
include enthesitis, dactylitis, and uveitis, but renal and hematologic manifestations (other than
anemia of chronic disease) are not common.

(Choices B, C, and E) Myelodysplastic syndromes and primary myelofibrosis are bone
marrow disorders that occur most commonly in patients over age 50. Vitamin B,, deficiency
can also cause impaired hematopoiesis. Although these disorders can cause pancytopenia,
this patient's arthritis and nephritis are much more consistent with SLE.

Educational objective:

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disorder that occurs most commonly in
women. Hematologic abnormalities are common; autoantibodies against blood cell antigens
(ie, type Il hypersensitivity) can cause pancytopenia (ie, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
leukopenia). In contrast, lupus nephritis is caused by immune complex deposition (ie, type III
hypersensitivity) in the glomeruli.
