Educational objective:

Crohn disease with ileal resection or extensive ileal involvement can cause bile acid
malabsorption, which may lead to impaired absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K).
Vitamin K deficiency can result in impaired coagulation with easy bruising, large hematoma
formation in deep tissues and joints (eg, hemarthrosis) after minor trauma, and prolonged

bleeding after surgery.
