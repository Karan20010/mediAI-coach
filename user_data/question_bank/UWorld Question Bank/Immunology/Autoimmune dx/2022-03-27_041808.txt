Educational objective:

Glucocorticoids have a variety of effects that can be useful in reducing inflammation and
limiting end-organ damage in inflammatory diseases (eg, sarcoidosis). These include
decreased proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1, interferon-gamma) production, increased anti-
inflammatory cytokine (eg, IL-10) production, and impaired migration of leukocytes (eg,
neutrophils) to sites of inflammation.
