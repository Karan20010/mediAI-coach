4 This patient, with an acute, pruritic rash and history of environmental allergies, has a typical
5
6 presentation of urticaria (hives). Hives are triggered in most cases by IgE-dependent mast cell
7 degranulation. As histamine is one of the primary mediators in this type of allergic reaction,
8
9 antihistamines (ie, H1 histamine receptor antagonists) are the preferred treatment in most
10 cases.

The side effects of antihistamines are largely due to blockade of other pathways, especially:

¢ Cholinergic/muscarinic (blurry vision, exacerbation of glaucoma, urine retention,
delirium, constipation)

¢ Alpha-adrenergic (postural dizziness, falls)

¢ Serotonergic (appetite stimulation, weight gain)

These side effects are especially prominent with first-generation antihistamines (eg,
hydroxyzine, promethazine, chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine) (Choices A, B, C and E).
Furthermore, first-generation antihistamines are lipophilic and easily cross the blood-brain
barrier, where they may cause significant sedation and cognitive dysfunction. First-generation
antihistamines are considered potentially inappropriate medications for elderly patients,
especially those with pre-existing cognitive or functional impairment.
