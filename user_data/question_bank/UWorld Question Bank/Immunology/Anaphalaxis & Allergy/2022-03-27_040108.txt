This patient with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain and an episode of facial swelling likely
has angioedema due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency. C1INH prevents C1-mediated
cleavage of C2 and C4, thereby limiting activation of the complement cascade. It also blocks
kallikrein-induced conversion of kininogen to bradykinin, a potent vasodilator that also causes

increased vascular permeability.

Acquired or hereditary C1INH deficiency (due to the complete absence of C1INH or the
presence of a dysfunctional variant or an anti-C1INH antibody) leads to elevated levels of
bradykinin, and patients can develop bradykinin-associated angioedema. Symptoms include
facial swelling (without urticaria), life-threatening laryngeal edema, and gastrointestinal
manifestations (eg, nausea/vomiting, colicky pain, diarrhea). Management of acute attacks
involves supportive care and the administration of C1INH concentrate or a kallikrein inhibitor.

(Choice A) Increased antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers are seen in a number of autoimmune
conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, which is associated with
hypocomplementemia but would have different clinical manifestations (eg, butterfly rash,
arthritis, oral ulcers). ANA production is not a result of excessive C1 activity.

(Choice B) Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis is associated with increased antistreptolysin

O titers, complement activation, and low levels of C3. The typical presentation is hematuria or
