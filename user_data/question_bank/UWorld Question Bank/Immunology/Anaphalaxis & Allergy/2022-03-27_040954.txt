(Choice E) Glucocorticoids reduce inflammation by several mechanisms. One such
mechanism is by promoting eosinophil apoptosis, either directly or by decreasing production of
IL-5, which usually promotes eosinophil survival. This decreases the number of circulating
eosinophils.

Educational objective:

Anaphylaxis is a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity reaction involving IgE-mediated mast cell
and basophil degranulation. Epinephrine is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis because it
decreases further mast cell release of inflammatory mediators and counteracts existing
systemic inflammatory effects (eg, shock, bronchoconstriction).
