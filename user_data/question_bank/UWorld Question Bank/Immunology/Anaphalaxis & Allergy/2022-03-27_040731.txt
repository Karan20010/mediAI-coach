Low serum levels of C1 esterase inhibitor (and its substrate C4) are diagnostic of hereditary
angioedema, an inherited autosomal dominant condition that causes episodes of painless,
non-pitting, well-circumscribed edema. The face, neck, lips, and tongue are most commonly
affected, but internal organs may also be involved. Angioedema affecting the tracheobronchial
tree can cause respiratory obstruction and is potentially fatal. Angioedema of the
gastrointestinal tract manifests with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Normally, C1 esterase inhibitor suppresses activation of the C1 complement component and
therefore the rest of the classic complement pathway. It also inactivates kallikrein, which
catalyzes the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin. In hereditary angioedema, low C1
esterase inhibitor activity leads to an increase in active kallikrein and bradykinin levels.
Bradykinin (along with C3a and C5a) mediate angioedema by increasing vasodilation and

vascular permeability.

Angioedema may also occur as a side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitor medications. ACE normally catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin | into
angiotensin Il. ACE also converts bradykinin into inactive metabolites. ACE inhibitors can
therefore lead to bradykinin accumulation. These medications should not be used in
patients with hereditary angioedema as they may precipitate disease episodes.
