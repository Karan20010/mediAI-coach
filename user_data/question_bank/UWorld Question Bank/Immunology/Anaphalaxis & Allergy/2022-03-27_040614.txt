(Choice D) ACE inhibitors decrease production of angiotensin II, which reduces negative
feedback on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, thereby promoting renin release.
Increased renin levels are a natural compensatory response to ACE inhibitor therapy and have
no role in causing angioedema.

(Choice E) In nonimmune mediated mast cell degranulation, there is direct activation of mast
cells independent of IgE cross-linking. These pseudoallergic reactions can be caused by
chemicals, heat, and certain drugs (eg, opiates, vancomycin) and are clinically similar to
hypersensitivity and allergic reactions.

Educational objective:

Angioedema is a rare and serious adverse effect of ACE inhibitor therapy. ACE inhibition
increases bradykinin levels, which increase vascular permeability and lead to angioedema.
Symptoms include tongue, lips, or eyelid swelling and, less frequently, laryngeal edema and
difficulty breathing. ACE inhibitors should be discontinued in affected patients.
