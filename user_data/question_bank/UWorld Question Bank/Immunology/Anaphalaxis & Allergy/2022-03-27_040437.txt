(Choice A) Halothane, an inhalation anesthetic, is rarely used but can cause hypotension via
direct suppression of myocardial contractility. It is not associated with itching and wheezing.

(Choice B) Because pain increases sympathetic output, opioid analgesia can reduce
sympathetic output and thus decrease heart rate and blood pressure. However, this does not

explain the itching and wheezing.

(Choice E) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase, which
leads to increased 5-lipoxygenase activity. This effect can precipitate bronchoconstriction and
wheezing due to increased production of leukotrienes (ie, NSAID-exacerbated respiratory
disease); however, itching and hypotension are not expected.

Educational objective:

Opioids (eg, morphine) can generate a pseudoallergic response by directly activating mast
cells to stimulate degranulation, releasing histamine and other vasoactive mediators. This
nonimmunologic reaction can cause itching, urticarial rash, wheezing, hypotension, and
tachycardia that closely mimic true IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity. However, true IgE-

mediated allergic reaction is rare with opioids.
