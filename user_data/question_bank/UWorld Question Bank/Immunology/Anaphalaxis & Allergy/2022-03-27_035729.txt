In addition, histamine can activate peripheral nociceptive receptors, causing pruritus or pain.

To mitigate its widespread effects, an antihistamine is often given as adjunct treatment in

anaphylaxis after mainstay treatment with intramuscular epinephrine.

(Choice A) Gram-negative bacterial endotoxins are the most potent mediators of gram-
negative sepsis. Although sepsis can present with hypotension, tachycardia, and respiratory
symptoms, children with sepsis typically have fever, and the onset of symptoms occurs over
hours to days (vs minutes). In addition, wheals are not expected.

(Choice B) Gram-positive bacterial enterotoxin is the cause of staphylococcal food poisoning,
which can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. However, symptoms typically
occur 2-8 hours after ingestion (vs immediately) of contaminated food, and wheezing and
wheals are not expected.

(Choice C) Kallikrein-generated bradykinin plays a role in bradykinin-mediated angioedema
(eg, hereditary, ACE inhibitor-related), which can cause bowel wall edema and result in
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In contrast to mast cell-mediated angioedema, bradykinin-
mediated angioedema does not typically cause bronchospasm, urticaria, or hypotension.

(Choice E) Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is secreted by VIPomas, rare functioning
