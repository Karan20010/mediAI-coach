Dyspnea, hypotension, and tachycardia soon after administration of B-lactam antibiotics are
suggestive of anaphylactic shock. Hypotension occurs in anaphylactic shock secondary to
collapse of peripheral vascular resistance, increases in vascular permeability, and leakage of
capillary fluid. Stimulation of the smooth muscle tone within the bronchial wall, along with an
increase in bronchial secretion, accounts for the dyspnea seen in anaphylaxis. Skin symptoms
(urticaria and angioedema) may occur secondary to vasodilatation and increased vascular
permeability of skin capillaries. Increases in GI smooth muscle tone may result in vomiting,
abdominal cramps, and diarrhea.

Epinephrine is the drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylactic shock due to its ability to
reverse all of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of anaphylaxis. Stimulation of a1 receptors
counteracts the vasodilatation of cutaneous and viscera vasculature, thus increasing blood
pressure. Epinephrine-mediated increases in cardiac contractility (81 effect) and cardiac
output also increase blood pressure and improve peripheral perfusion. Epinephrine-induced
stimulation of B2 receptors results in bronchodilatation, making it also a popular choice for the

treatment of severe asthmatic reactions.

(Choice A) Steroids inhibit inflammation by reducing capillary permeability and suppressing
neutrophil activity. Steroids also inhibit phospholipase A2, resulting in decreased formation of
