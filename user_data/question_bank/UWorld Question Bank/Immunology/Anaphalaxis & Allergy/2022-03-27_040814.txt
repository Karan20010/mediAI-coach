This boy developed fever, irritability, and local inflammatory symptoms (eg, redness,

tenderness, swelling) within hours of vaccination, indicating reactogenicity, an inflammatory
reaction that occurs shortly after vaccination.

Vaccinations typically inject a foreign, unencountered antigen into subcutaneous tissue in
order to promote the development of adaptive immunity against the antigen. However, foreign
antigens can also trigger a rapid-onset innate immune response driven by the presence of
pattern recognition receptors (eg, toll-like receptors) on local stromal and local/circulating
immune cells (eg, macrophages, monocytes, mast cells).

Pattern recognition receptors identify conserved motifs present on many pathogens (eg,

lipopolysaccharide). Activation of these receptors leads to the release of pyrogenic

cytokines (eg, TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6), which can cause local inflammation (eg, edema,
warmth, swelling) due to increased vascular permeability/immune cell recruitment and
systemic inflammation (eg, fever, irritability, fatigue, headache) due to increased circulating
inflammatory cytokines.

Many vaccines also contain adjuvants (eg, aluminum salts, virosomes, oil-in-water) to
increase the immune response to the injected antigen. Adjuvants are strongly
immunostimulatory and frequently increase the risk of reactogenicity. However, manifestations
