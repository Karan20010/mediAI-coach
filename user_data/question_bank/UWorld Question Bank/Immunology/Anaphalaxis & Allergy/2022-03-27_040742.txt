(Choice B) Furosemide can cause hypokalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypovolemia.
Ototoxicity may occur if furosemide is used with aminoglycosides.

(Choice C) Methotrexate can cause hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and bone marrow

suppression.

(Choice D) Metoprolol is a selective B1-adrenergic blocker with few side effects. It may cause
heart block in patients with conduction system disease and bronchoconstriction in asthmatic
patients (rare due to B81 selectivity but can still occur).

(Choice E) The most common side effect of penicillin is hypersensitivity.

Educational objective:

Angioedema can be hereditary (autosomal dominant) or acquired (associated with
angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitor treatment). In hereditary angioedema, low C1
esterase inhibitor activity leads to increases in bradykinin activity. ACE inhibitors should not be

used in these patients.
