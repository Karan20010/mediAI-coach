immunostimulatory and frequently increase the risk of reactogenicity. However, manifestations
of reactogenicity tend to improve 24-36 hours after vaccination.

(Choices A and C) Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that display foreign
antigens on their surface on major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. CD4 T
lymphocytes with antigen-specific receptors bind to the antigen on the APCs and are
costimulated by the interaction between CD80/86 on the APCs and CD28 on the T-cell
surface. Activated CD4 T-cells then increase display of CD40 ligand, which binds CD40 on the
APC, leading to full APC maturation. These adaptive immune responses take several days to
form and do not cause local reactions soon after vaccination.

(Choice B) Cytotoxic T-cells recognize a foreign antigen on major histocompatibility complex
class | and release perforins to induce cell lysis; they primarily attack cells infected by
intracellular pathogens (eg, viruses). Cytotoxic T-cells do not significantly contribute to
vaccination reactions within hours of vaccination.

(Choice E) Some activated B-cells differentiate into short-lived plasma cells that secrete IgM.
However, this typically takes several days to occur and would not cause local inflammatory

symptoms.
