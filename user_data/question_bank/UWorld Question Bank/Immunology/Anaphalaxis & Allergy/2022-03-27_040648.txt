negative ionotropic effects on the heart, decreasing cardiac contractility. However, this is
typically counterbalanced by the body's sympathetic response to anaphylaxis; increased
sympathetic activity has a positive inotropic effect and increases the heart rate in an attempt to
compensate for widespread peripheral vasodilation.

(Choice C) Increased, not impaired, endogenous sympathetic nerve activity is the body's
early compensatory response in anaphylaxis. In response to anaphylaxis-induced
hypotension, an intact baroreceptor reflex leads to increased sympathetic activity, tachycardia,
and compensatory vasoconstriction.

(Choices D and E) A toxin-mediated decrease in myocardial contractility and an increase in
capillary permeability occur in toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Most cases are linked to a
prolonged use of tampons and wound/nasal packing (not wasp envenomation), which provide
a medium for Staphylococcus aureus to replicate and release an exotoxin (eg, TSS toxin 1)
that is capable of nonspecifically activating T cells (ie, a superantigen). The subsequent
dramatic release of inflammatory cytokines results in increased capillary permeability and
hypotension, as well as high fever and a diffuse, erythematous rash. In addition, the exotoxin
can directly inhibit myocardial function.
