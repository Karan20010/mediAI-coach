Opioids (eg, morphine) can generate a pseudoallergic response by directly stimulating
mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine and other vasoactive mediators. This
nonimmunologic reaction can cause itching, urticarial rash, wheezing, hypotension, and
tachycardia that closely mimic true IgE-mediated type 1 hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis).
However, true IgE-mediated allergic reaction is rare with opioids (Choice D), and suggestive
symptoms rarely indicate the need to avoid opioids altogether. Because direct mast cell
degranulation tends to be most prominent with relatively low-potency opioids (eg, morphine,
meperidine), a relatively high-potency opioid (eg, fentanyl) is usually better tolerated.

Other drugs that can have a similar non-lgE-mediated effect on mast cell degranulation
include vancomycin (ie, red man syndrome) and radioiodine contrast.

(Choice A) Halothane, an inhalation anesthetic, is rarely used but can cause hypotension via
direct suppression of myocardial contractility. It is not associated with itching and wheezing.

(Choice B) Because pain increases sympathetic output, opioid analgesia can reduce
sympathetic output and thus decrease heart rate and blood pressure. However, this does not

explain the itching and wheezing.

(Choice E) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenase, which
