¢ Direct removal: Mononuclear phagocytes bind to the Fc portion of the bound IgG using
their Fc receptor (CD16) and remove the IC from the circulation.

IC clearance generally proceeds without issue, but significant quantities of ICs can saturate
the phagocytic system and lead to IC aggregation; IC aggregates can deposit in tissue (eg,
skin, joints), where persistent complement activation can result in a type Ill hypersensitivity
reaction called serum sickness. This is typically marked by fever, urticarial rash, and joint
pain 5-14 days after exposure. Most cases resolve spontaneously over days as
mononuclear phagocytes continue to remove the excess ICs.

(Choice B) Glucocorticoids trigger apoptotic cell death of eosinophils and tissue mast cells in
patients with allergic conditions (eg, asthma). Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death, is
not typically associated with degranulation or allergic symptoms.

(Choices C and D) Antibodies are too large to be cleared from the bloodstream through
fenestrations in the liver or kidney. Instead, they are typically removed via endocytosis or
phagocytosis after binding Fc receptors on the surface of immune cells (eg, macrophages,
eosinophils, mast cells). Endocytosis and degradation of mast cell-bound IgE occurs with type
| hypersensitivity reactions (which occur within minutes, not days later); in addition, this
process is only responsible for removing tiny amounts of IgE (not ICs) from the body.
