(Choice E) Regulatory T cells downregulate the cytotoxic T-cell response. Although cytotoxic
T cells mediate Stevens-Johnson syndrome (destruction of keratinocytes that are displaying
drug antigens), they do not play a role in the development of serum sickness.

Educational objective:

Serum sickness is an immune complexâ€”mediated type Ill hypersensitivity reaction that
typically forms 5-14 days after exposure to foreign proteins in an antitoxin, antivenom,
monoclonal antibody, or vaccine. Patients typically develop fever, urticarial rash, and
arthralgia that resolve spontaneously over days as the immune complexes are cleared by the
mononuclear phagocyte system.
