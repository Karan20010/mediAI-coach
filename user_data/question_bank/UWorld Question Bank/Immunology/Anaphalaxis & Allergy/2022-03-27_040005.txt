Educational objective:

The high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) is found on the surface of mast cells and basophils and
normally binds the Fc portion of circulating IgE antibodies. Cross-linking of multiple
membrane-bound IgE antibodies by a multivalent antigen results in aggregation of the FceRI
receptors, causing degranulation and the release of preformed mediators (eg, histamine,
tryptase) that initiate an allergic response.
