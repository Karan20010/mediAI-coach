This patient was given vancomycin and shortly thereafter developed burning, itching, and an
erythematous rash on the face and neck, raising strong suspicion for red man syndrome
(RMS). RMS is a nonallergic reaction that occurs when vancomycin is infused too rapidly;
rapid vancomycin infusion can directly activate mast cells, leading to the release of potent

vasoactive mediators (eg, histamine).

Manifestations of RMS include flushing, pruritus, and an erythematous rash, which is usually
seen on the upper torso, neck, and face. Myalgias and hypotension can occasionally occur.
Discontinuation of the vancomycin and administration of diphenhydramine are usually
curative. Because RMS is not IgE mediated, it is not a true allergic reaction, so vancomycin

infusion can be resumed at a slower rate once symptoms resolve.

(Choice A) Patients with spirochetal illness (eg, syphilis, Lyme disease) can develop the
Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction after the initiation of antimicrobial therapy. It is caused by
massive release of bacterial products into the circulation due to widespread bacterial lysis.
However, most cases arise several hours (not minutes) after antimicrobial therapy and are
marked by high fever and worsened constitutional symptoms (eg, headache, myalgia).

(Choices B and D) Antibody-mediated drug reactions generally require previous exposure
(sensitization) to the medication. This patient who has never received vancomycin is unlikely
