This patient with diffuse cerebral edema, laryngeal edema, and hyperinflated lungs most likely
died from anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis classically involves a type 1 (immediate) hypersensitivity
reaction to an antigen that leads to IgE-mediated mast cell and basophil degranulation. The
resulting sudden and massive release of inflammatory mediators (eg, histamine, leukotrienes)
into the circulation can quickly lead to airway obstruction (eg, bronchospasm, oropharyngeal
edema) and distributive shock (ie, profound peripheral vasodilation).

Although some patients (eg, those who experience rapid cardiovascular collapse) have no
significant gross autopsy findings, the most common abnormal findings resulting from
anaphylaxis include the following:

¢ Laryngeal and/or pharyngeal edema

¢ Hyperinflation of the lungs (due to air trapping from airway obstruction)
¢ Cerebral edema (due to cerebral hypoxia)

Cutaneous abnormalities (eg, urticaria, flushing) may also be present because anaphylaxis
often involves the skin.

To help confirm the diagnosis, patient serum can be sent for tryptase level analysis. Tryptase,
a mediator released from mast cells, is elevated in many cases of anaphylaxis.
