Educational objective:

Vaccine reactogenicity is a local (eg, warmth, swelling, edema) and systemic (eg, fatigue,
fever, headache) inflammatory reaction to the vaccine due to the innate immune response. It
is primarily caused by pattern recognition receptors present on the surface of macrophages
and mast cells, which identify the antigen and release inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-1, IL-6).
