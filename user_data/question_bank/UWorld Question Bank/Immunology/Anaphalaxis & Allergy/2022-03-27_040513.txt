*ACE inhibitors exacerbate angioedema attacks. Ouworld

This patient's recurrent facial swelling is most likely due to hereditary angioedema, which is
characterized by a deficiency or dysfunction of C1 inhibitor (previously referred to as C1
esterase inhibitor). Poor C1 inhibitor function leads to elevated bradykinin, a peptide that
causes vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, resulting in edema.

Presentation is typically in childhood or adolescence with episodes of swelling affecting the
skin (eg, face, extremities) and mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and/or larynx. Attacks are
often precipitated by minor trauma (eg, dental procedure) or emotional stress and are not
associated with itching or urticaria.

Initial evaluation of hereditary angioedema is with complement testing. Low C4 is
characteristic because, in the absence of C1 inhibitor, unregulated activation of C1 leads to
excess activated C1 and, in turn, unchecked cleavage of C4. Diagnosis is confirmed by a
decrease in functional C1 inhibitor level.

(Choices A and E) Elevated eosinophils and IgE are associated with allergic conditions. In
contrast to bradykinin-mediated hereditary angioedema, allergic angioedema (eg, anaphylaxis)
is due to histamine release from activated mast cells and presents with pruritis and urticaria in

addition to swelling.
