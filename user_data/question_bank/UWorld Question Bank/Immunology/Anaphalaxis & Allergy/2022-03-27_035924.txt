Question Id: 2068
This patient is experiencing an anaphylactic reaction to the cephalosporin cefazolin.
Anaphylaxis is a systemic type 1 hypersensitivity reaction characterized by increased vascular
permeability and multisystem edema, leading to massive shifting of intravascular fluid to the
extravascular compartment. Symptoms often begin within seconds to minutes after
intravascular exposure to an inciting factor (eg, insect stings, intravenous medications) but can
take up to 2 hours to develop with orally ingested antigens.

Anaphylaxis results from widespread mast cell and basophil degranulation and resultant
histamine and tryptase release. Tryptase is an enzyme that is relatively specific to mast
cells, and elevated serum levels of tryptase are often used to support a clinical diagnosis of
anaphylaxis after the patient has been stabilized.

(Choice A) Alkaline phosphatase is present in all cells of the body, but the highest levels are
found in the liver, bones, and placenta.
(Choice B) Calcitonin is produced by the C cells of the thyroid gland and can be useful as a

tumor marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma.

(Choices C and D) Collagenases breakdown collagen. Myeloperoxidase catalyzes formation
of hypochlorous acid (ie, bleach) during the oxidative burst in the immune response to
