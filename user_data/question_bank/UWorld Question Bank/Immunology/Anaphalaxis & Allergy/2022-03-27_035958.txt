The high-affinity IgE receptor (FceRI) is found on mast cells and basophils and plays a
primary role in mediating the allergic response. The receptor normally binds the Fc portion of
circulating IgE, coating the cell with various antigen-specific IgE molecules. When a
multivalent antigen comes in contact with the cell, multiple IgE antibodies become cross-
linked, resulting in aggregation of the FceRI receptors on the mast cell surface. This
clumping of receptors leads to the activation of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, triggering an
intracellular cascade that ultimately results in mast cell and basophil degranulation.

(Choices A and B) The high strength of the IgE-FceRI bond is a result of the sum of many
weak noncovalent forces; it is not associated with the formation of covalent (eg, disulfide,
peptide) bonds. The strength of this attachment is such that antibody-receptor dissociation is
rare; most of the total IgE in the body is bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils and

not circulating freely.

(Choice D) Receptor detachment from the cell surface is not a known mechanism of signal

transduction.

(Choice E) Receptor internalization occurs in the process of synaptic desensitization to
excessive neurotransmitter stimulation. It also occurs in receptor-mediated endocytosis of

substances such as iron (ie, transferrin receptor) and cholesterol (ie, LDL receptor).
