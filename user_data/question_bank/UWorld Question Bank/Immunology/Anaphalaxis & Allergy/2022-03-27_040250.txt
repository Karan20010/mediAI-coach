and vascular endothelial cells) to decrease uptake of allergen particles, decrease mucus
production, and decrease vascular permeability.

(Choice B) Mast cells and eosinophils release cysteinyl-containing leukotrienes (leukotriene
C., D,, and E,) that trigger mucus secretion and edema. Cysteinyl leukotriene receptor
antagonists (eg, montelukast, zafirlukast) block these leukotriene-mediated effects to improve
symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

(Choice C) The anti-lgE antibody omalizumab binds circulating IgE to decrease serum IgE
levels and limit the allergen-induced immunologic response.

(Choice D) In addition to inducing T cell apoptosis, glucocorticoids also promote (not reduce)
differentiation of T cells into regulatory subsets. These regulatory T cells (Treg) decrease the
immune response to allergens partly by producing IL-10, which inhibits macrophage function
and downregulates expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on antigen-
presenting cells.

Educational objective:

Glucocorticoids inhibit transcription of proinflammatory mediators and promote apoptosis of

eosinophils, T cells, and monocytes. ctivate Window
