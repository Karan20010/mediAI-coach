(Choice A) Delayed-type reactions are due to the direct action of sensitized T cells when
stimulated by contact with an antigen. They occur hours to days, rather than minutes, after
exposure and typically present with a rash.

(Choice B) An excessive cytokine response to the microbial components of a vaccine can
result in a self-limiting local reaction (eg, redness or pain at the vaccination site) or,
sometimes, systemic symptoms (eg, fever, malaise).

to an immunocompromised host may cause uncontrolled replication and systemic invasion of
the virus. Symptoms of an active infection would not manifest until >12-24 hours. Neither the
