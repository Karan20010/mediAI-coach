(Choice A) Steroids inhibit inflammation by reducing capillary permeability and suppressing
neutrophil activity. Steroids also inhibit phospholipase A2, resulting in decreased formation of
prostaglandin inflammatory mediators. Because steroids anti-inflammatory effects are not
acute, they are not effective in the acute treatment of life-threatening anaphylaxis.

Epinephrine should be given prior to steroids and antihistamines in the treatment of
anaphylaxis.

(Choice C) Norepinephrine has a predominantly alpha-1 adrenergic effect; thus, it can cause
intense vasoconstriction, which may limit cardiac output. Furthermore, it has little effect on the
beta-2 adrenoceptor, so it has little or no bronchodilator action.

(Choice D) Dobutamine is a synthetic drug with primary beta-1 adrenergic action that can
cause an increased cardiac output without the other effects of epinephrine.

(Choice E) Diphenhydramine is a first generation antihistamine drug that competitively inhibits
peripheral H1 receptors in the Gl tract, blood vessels, and respiratory tract. Diphenhydramine
may be used for the treatment of anaphylaxis after the patient is stabilized with epinephrine.

Educational Objective:
Anaphylactic shock is characterized by vasodilatation, increased vascular permeability, and
