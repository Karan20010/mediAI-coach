This patient's sudden-onset gastrointestinal symptoms, hypotension and tachycardia,
wheezing, and urticaria (eg, wheals) are consistent with anaphylaxis. While at a picnic
outdoors, this patient was likely exposed to an allergen (eg, insect sting) that caused cross-
linking of basophil-bound and mast cell—bound IgE antibodies, inducing cellular activation,

degranulation, and release of histamine and other chemical mediators (eg, prostaglandin,

leukotrienes).

Although multiple chemical mediators play a role in anaphylaxis, histamine is believed to

cause the most significant, broad-ranging effects, including the following:

e H, and H, receptor stimulation results in vasodilation (causing hypotension) and
increased catecholamine secretion (causing tachycardia).

¢ H, receptor stimulation causes increased bronchial smooth muscle contraction (resulting in
bronchoconstriction and wheezing) and increased vascular permeability (worsening
hypotension and contributing to urticaria).

¢ H, receptor stimulation increases gastric acid secretion, which contributes to

gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, nausea, vomiting).

In addition, histamine can activate peripheral nociceptive receptors, causing pruritus or pain.
