emotional distress—induced cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor response. Vaccine
administration is a known precipitant of vasovagal syncope, especially in adolescents.
Because syncope-related falls can lead to serious injury (eg, skull fractures, intracranial
hemorrhage), patients should be closely monitored for 15 minutes following vaccine
administration.

Patients with vasovagal syncope typically experience a prodrome (eg, pallor, nausea,
diaphoresis) prior to losing consciousness. The mechanism is not well understood, but the
trigger, in combination with a state of orthostatic stress (eg, upright posture, dehydration), is
believed to signal the CNS to decrease sympathetic activity and increase parasympathetic
tone, overriding the normal baroreceptor response. This leads to bradycardia, reduced LV
contractility, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in hypotension,
decreased cerebral perfusion, and, ultimately, syncope. Symptoms rapidly resolve within 1-2
minutes.

Postvaccination syncope can be confused with anaphylaxis, a rare but serious adverse effect
resulting from IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to a vaccine component (eg, egg or yeast
proteins). Anaphylaxis can develop rapidly following vaccination and may cause hypotension
