a mediator released from mast cells, is elevated in many cases of anaphylaxis.

(Choice A) In most cases of sudden death due to acute myocardial infarction (Ml), death is
due to an arrhythmia resulting from acute coronary occlusion, and an occlusive thrombus is
often present on autopsy. Although cerebral edema could be present from hypoxia, an acute
MI would not be expected to cause laryngeal edema and hyperinflated lungs.

(Choice C) Patients with sudden death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
exacerbation could have hyperinflation of the lungs due to airway obstruction, as well as
cerebral edema due to hypoxia. However, because COPD is a disease of the lower airway, it

would not be expected to cause upper airway (eg, laryngeal) edema.

(Choice D) Meningococcal meningitis can cause cerebral edema, as found on autopsy, but
also commonly causes a purulent exudate in the meninges. It would not be expected to cause

laryngeal edema or lung hyperinflation.

(Choice E) Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy is not well understood but is believed to be
caused by central apnea or cardiac arrythmias. It is the most common seizure-related cause
of death and is frequently associated with cerebral edema, which is demonstrated on autopsy.
However, laryngeal edema and lung hyperinflation are not expected. In addition, tongue

lacerations and cutaneous abrasions are frequently present.
