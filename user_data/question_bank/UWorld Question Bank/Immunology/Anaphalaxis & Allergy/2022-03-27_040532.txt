(Choice C) C8 is involved in the formation of the membrane attack complex, which, when
deficient, results in increased susceptibility to Neisseria infections. Deficiency of terminal
complement components (C5, C6, C7, C8, C9) does not occur with hereditary angioedema
because the upstream complement fragments (C2b, C4b) are rapidly inactivated in the

plasma.

(Choice D) Selective IgA deficiency increases risk for anaphylaxis, which can cause
angioedema. However, this risk is only with transfusion of blood products and would present
with other organ system involvement (eg, bronchospasm, hypotension, urticaria). IgA
deficiency is also associated with certain autoimmune conditions (eg, celiac disease, systemic
lupus erythematosus), but none of these would present with isolated facial swelling.

Educational objective:
Hereditary angioedema is characterized by recurrent episodes of cutaneous and/or mucosal
swelling due to C1 inhibitor deficiency. C4 levels are low due to uninhibited cleavage of C4 by

excess activated C1.
