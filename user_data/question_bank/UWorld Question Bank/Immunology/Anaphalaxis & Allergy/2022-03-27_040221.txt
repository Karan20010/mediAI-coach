(Choice B) IL-2 is a cytokine produced by T,,1 lymphocytes that increases proliferation and

activity of helper, cytotoxic, and regulatory T cells as well as NK cells. T,1 cells are

responsible for inducing macrophage and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated (type IV)

inflammatory reactions. In contrast, IL-4 is responsible for driving the production of T,2 cells,

which promote antibody-mediated (humoral) immunity and facilitate type | hypersensitivity.

(Choice D) Lysozyme is an antimicrobial enzyme found in specific granules of neutrophils and
bodily secretions (tears, mucus). Lysozyme functions by hydrolyzing bonds within the
peptidoglycan cell walls of bacterial organisms. It is an important component of innate
immunity, not hypersensitivity reactions.

(Choice E) TNF-a is a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages and T cells that
induces and maintains granuloma formation (important for host defense against tuberculosis).
It also plays a pathogenic role in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease. TNF-a may be elevated in type IV (delayed type)
hypersensitivity, but not type I.
