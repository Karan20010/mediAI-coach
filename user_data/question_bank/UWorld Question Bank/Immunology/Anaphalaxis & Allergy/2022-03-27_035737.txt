(Choice E) Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide is secreted by VIPomas, rare functioning
neuroendocrine tumors most often located in the pancreas. VIPomas can cause watery
diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; however, acute-onset hypotension, wheezing, and wheals are
not expected.

Educational objective:

Anaphylaxis is an IgE-mediated response to an allergen that results in the release of histamine
by mast cells and basophils. Histamine causes widespread physiologic effects, including
vasodilation and increased vascular permeability (eg, hypotension), increased catecholamine
secretion (eg, tachycardia), and bronchoconstriction (eg, wheezing).
