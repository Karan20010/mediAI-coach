Newer-generation antihistamines (eg, loratadine, cetirizine) do not have the same degree of
antimuscarinic, antiserotonergic, or anti-alpha adrenergic properties and their side effects are
minimal. Moreover, second-generation antihistamines are less lipophilic, do not readily cross
the blood-brain barrier, and are usually nonsedating.

Educational objective:

First-generation antihistamines can cause significant side effects due to blockade of
cholinergic, alpha-adrenergic, and serotonergic pathways. They should be avoided in older
patients with cognitive or functional impairments.
