(Choice A) The rough endoplasmic reticulum has a stippled appearance secondary to the
presence of numerous ribosomes bound to its membranes. These ribosomes are involved in
the synthesis of integral membrane proteins and proteins destined for export or packaging into
granules or organelles.

(Choice B) The dark region identified within the nucleus is the nucleolus, the site of synthesis
and assembly of eukaryotic ribosomal components. There is no lipid membrane separating
the nucleolus from the rest of the nucleus.

(Choice C) The lighter "electron-lucent" regions within the nucleus signify euchromatin
(unpackaged DNA being actively transcribed).

(Choice E) This electron-dense membrane-bound spherical structure represents an exocrine
granule containing enzymes and other proteins packaged for secretion.

Educational objective:

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is the most common non-nuclear DNA found in eukaryotic cells. It
resembles prokaryotic DNA and is maternally derived. Mutations involving mtDNA (or nuclear
DNA that codes for mitochondrial proteins) can cause a variety of mitochondrial disorders,
including Leigh syndrome and MELAS.
