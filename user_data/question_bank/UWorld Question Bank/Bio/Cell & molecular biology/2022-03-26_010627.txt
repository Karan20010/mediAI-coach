This patient has experienced a prolonged fast, but her blood glucose level is normal. As blood
glucose levels fall in the fasting state, hypoglycemia is prevented due to suppression of insulin
secretion and activation of counterregulatory hormones. Glucagon is the primary hormone
secreted acutely in response to falling glucose levels; it stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis. Concurrently, epinephrine further stimulates glycogenolysis and
gluconeogenesis, increases the release of gluconeogenic substrates from muscle and fat, and
limits glucose utilization by some insulin-sensitive peripheral tissues.

As the fast continues, secretion of cortisol and growth hormone increases; these hormones
attenuate hypoglycemia by altering transcription of key enzymes. In the inactivated state,
intracellular cortisol receptors are found in the cytoplasm in association with heat shock
proteins. Binding of cortisol to the carboxy terminal portion of the receptor causes the release
of the heat shock proteins and allows receptor dimerization. The activated homodimers are
then transported to the nucleus, where they control gene expression by binding to hormone-
responsive DNA elements in the promoter region of target genes. Cortisol increases
transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes as well as those involved in lipolysis and
proteolysis.
