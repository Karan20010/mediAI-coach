Educational objective:

Transport of glucose into the cells of most tissues occurs by means of facilitated diffusion.
Glucose moves from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration with the help of
transmembrane glucose transporter proteins (GLUT). These carrier proteins are

stereoselective and have preference for D-glucose.
