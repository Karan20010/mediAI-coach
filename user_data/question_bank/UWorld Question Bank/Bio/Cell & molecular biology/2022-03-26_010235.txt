The zinc-finger structure represents the most commonly identified DNA-binding domain in
humans. Zinc-finger motifs are composed of chains of amino acids bound together around a
zinc atom via linkages with cysteine (and sometimes histidine) residues. This forms a stable,
finger-shaped structure containing 2 antiparallel B- strands and an a-helix. Unique
combinations of amino acids as well as the specific histidine and cysteine linkages determine
DNA-binding specificity. Many transcription factors use multiple zinc-finger motifs to recognize
specific genes and alter their activity.

Although most hormones alter transcription regulation to some degree in target cells, only
intracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus can act directly as transcription
factors. These intracellular receptors typically bind lipid-soluble hormones because the
ligand has to diffuse across the cell membrane to reach the receptor. Once bound to their
ligand, these receptors bind directly to target DNA sequences via zinc fingers to regulate gene
expression. Examples include steroid (eg, estrogen, aldosterone, cortisol), thyroid hormone,
and fat-soluble vitamin receptors.
