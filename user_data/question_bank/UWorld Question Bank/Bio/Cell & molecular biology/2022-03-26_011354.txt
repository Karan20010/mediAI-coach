Ubiquitin is a protein found in all eukaryotic cells that undergoes ATP-dependent attachment to
other proteins, labeling them for degradation. The proteasome then recognizes these
ubiquinated proteins and uses ATP energy to drive them through its tubular structure,
degrading them into small peptides in the process. Attachment of 4 or more ubiquitin
monomers is required before most proteins are allowed entry into the proteasome.
Ubiquitination plays an important role in many cell functions, including antigen processing,
muscle wasting, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and disposal of misfolded proteins and
regulatory enzymes.

Impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can contribute to the development of
neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases. Failure of the
system to properly degrade abnormal proteins causes protein misfolding, aggregation, and
eventual obstruction of intracellular molecular traffic, leading to cell death. Together, the
Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 genes code for a protein complex that promotes the degradation of
misfolded proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Mutations in Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1
are each associated with autosomal recessive forms of Parkinson’s disease that have an early
age of onset (< 50 years).
