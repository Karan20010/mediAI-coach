(Choices A and E) The intracellular domains of the integrins interact with a number of
structural proteins, including microfilaments (actin) within the cytoplasm and intermediate
filaments (keratin). However, the extracellular domains do not interact with these structures.

(Choices C and D) Hyaluronic acid is a glycosaminoglycan that contributes to water retention
in the extracellular matrix, and determines the stiffness of the matrix. Keratan sulfate is a
glycosaminoglycan in the extracellular matrix that may play a role in maintaining type |
collagen fibril organization in a number of tissues (eg, cornea). However, neither of these is a
ligand for integrins.
