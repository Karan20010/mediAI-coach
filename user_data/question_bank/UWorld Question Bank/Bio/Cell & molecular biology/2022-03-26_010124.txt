(Choices A and E) Parathyroid hormone and glucagon act on Gs protein-coupled receptors
found on the cell membrane. Binding their respective ligands subsequently activates adenylyl
cyclase and increases intracellular cyclic AMP concentration.

(Choice B) Growth hormone receptor is a membrane-bound receptor that works via activating
the JAK-STAT pathway.

(Choices C and D) The receptors for insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and insulin are
structurally similar and located at the cell membrane. The intracellular domains of these
receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which is activated on ligand binding.
Autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues on the intracellular part of the receptors then
triggers downstream signaling.
