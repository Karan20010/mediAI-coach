The process of apoptosis involves the following steps:

1. Initiation: Apoptosis is triggered by different stimuli and can occur through either the
intrinsic, mitochondria-mediated pathway or the extrinsic, receptor-initiated pathway. Cells
damaged by ultraviolet light, heat, hypoxia, toxins, or radiation display intrinsic apoptotic
signals (eg, phosphatidylserine or thrombospondin) on their plasma membranes. Extrinsic
apoptosis, in contrast, is induced by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) when bound to tumor
necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR71) or the Fas ligand when bound to cell surface receptor
Fas.

2. Control: Intrinsic apoptosis is mediated by a group of bcl-2 proteins. Some of the
components of this system are pro-apoptotic (eg, Bak, Bax, and Bim proteins), while
others are anti-apoptotic (eg, Bcl-x and Bcl-2 proteins). Apoptotic signals tip the balance
between these two forces, resulting in changes of the inner mitochondrial membrane.
These changes are responsible for the formation of the mitochondrial permeability
transition (MPT) and the release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins into the
cytoplasm, which then activate caspases. In extrinsic apoptosis, the binding of the death
ligand and the death receptor allows for pro-caspase molecules to be brought into close
proximity.
