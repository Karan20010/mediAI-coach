(Choice A) Steroid hormones, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D act by binding to intracellular
receptors with DNA-binding domains that interact with the regulatory DNA sequences of target

genes.

(Choice C) Transmembrane ligand-gated ion channels (ionotropic receptors) allow a
regulated flux of calcium, sodium, potassium, and chloride ions across the cell membrane.
Neurotransmitters that work via ion channel-linked receptors include acetylcholine, serotonin,
N-methyl-D-aspartate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid.

(Choice D) Insulin and insulin-like growth factor work by stimulating transmembrane receptors
with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity in the intracellular domain, initiating a downstream
phosphorylation cascade.

(Choice E) Janus kinase (JAK) is a cytoplasmic protein activated by ligand binding to
transmembrane receptors. JAKs activate cytoplasmic transcription factors called signal
transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), which enter the nucleus to promote gene
transcription. Examples of hormones using a JAK/STAT messenger system include
erythropoietin, growth hormone, and prolactin.
