3. Destruction: Both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converge at this step, resulting in
caspase activation. Caspases are proteolytic enzymes that destroy cell components.
They contain cysteine and are able to cleave aspartic acid residues (cysteine-aspartic-
acid-proteases). The eleven caspases that have been identified are classified as either
initiator or effector caspases. Initiator caspases activate the effector caspases, which then
cleave the cellular proteins.
