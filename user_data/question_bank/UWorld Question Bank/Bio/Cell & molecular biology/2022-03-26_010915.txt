Because intracellular K- concentration is much greater than its extracellular concentration,
opening of cellular potassium channels leads to K- efflux from the cell along the K-
concentration gradient. Within the cell, the positive charge of the K- ions is normally
neutralized by the negative charge of intracellular anions (eg, phosphates and proteins) that

are trapped in the cell. As K- ions leave the cell, negatively charged anions accumulate along
the inner side of the cell membrane. This continually increasing negative charge attracts the
positively charged K- ions back into the cell. When the difference in concentration (diffusion
potential) of K- inside and outside the cell is large, the efflux of K- ions will continue despite the
increasing negative charge. At a certain point, however, the negative intracellular charge
(electrical potential) of the membrane becomes large enough that the number of K- ions it
attracts into the cell equals the number of K: ions that leave the cell along the concentration
gradient. The electrical potential difference that moves K- ions into the cell at the same rate as
they leave the cell along the concentration gradient is called the equilibrium potential.
Educational objective:

When a specific ion channel opens, the respective ions will flow across the membrane in a
direction that brings the resting membrane potential closer to that ion's equilibrium potential.
