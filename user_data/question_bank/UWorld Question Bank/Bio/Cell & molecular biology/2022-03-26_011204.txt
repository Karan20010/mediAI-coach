Educational objective:

Integral membrane proteins contain transmembrane domains composed of alpha helices with
hydrophobic amino acid residues (eg, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine,
tryptophan, methionine, proline, glycine). These transmembrane domains help anchor the
protein to the phospholipid bilayer of the cell membrane.
