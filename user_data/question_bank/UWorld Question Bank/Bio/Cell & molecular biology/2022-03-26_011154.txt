G protein-coupled receptors that bind glycoprotein hormones (eg, TSH, LH, FSH) contain 3
major domains: an extracellular domain responsible for ligand binding, a transmembrane
domain, and an intracellular domain coupled with heterotrimeric G proteins.

The transmembrane domain is made up of nonpolar, hydrophobic amino acids (eg,
alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, proline, glycine).
These amino acids are arranged in an alpha-helical fashion and project their hydrophobic R
groups outwardly, anchoring the transmembrane region of the protein to the hydrophobic core
of the phospholipid bilayer. The transmembrane domain may also play an important role in
cellular signaling and transport.
