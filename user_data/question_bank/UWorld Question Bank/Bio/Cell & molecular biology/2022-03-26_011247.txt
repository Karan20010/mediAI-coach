RAS genes code for a family of small G-proteins involved in signal transduction in the Ras-
MAPK pathway. Ras proteins exist in 2 different states: an inactive GDP-bound state and an
active GTP-bound state. Ras becomes activated when a growth factor ligand binds to a
receptor tyrosine kinase located on the cell membrane, causing autophosphorylation of the
receptor. This triggers binding of adaptor proteins that interact with Ras, promoting GDP
removal and GTP binding. Activated Ras then begins a phosphorylation cascade that results
in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which enters the nucleus to
influence gene transcription.

Ras proteins have intrinsic GTPase activity that allows them to hydrolyze GTP; this
mechanism prevents accumulation of active Ras (GTP-bound) in the absence of hormonal
signaling. RAS gene mutations can lead to decreased intrinsic GTPase activity; this results in
a constitutively activated Ras protein that causes constant and unregulated cell proliferation.
RAS mutations are commonly identified in cancerous tumors, specifically colorectal and
pancreatic malignancies.
