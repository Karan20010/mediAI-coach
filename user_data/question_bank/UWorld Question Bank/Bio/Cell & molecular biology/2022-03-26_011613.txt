stores from the endoplasmic reticulum. PKC is the major effector molecule in this
pathway; it directly modulates the activity of other proteins via phosphorylation.
(Choices B and C) Intracellular CAMP and cGMP concentrations increase during activation of
adenylate or guanylate cyclase second messenger systems, respectively. Levels can also
increase following cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase inhibition, as seen on exposure to
sildenafil, which selectively inhibits cGMP phosphodiesterease and results in smooth muscle
relaxation in blood vessels.
(Choice D) Intracellular Cl concentration increases slightly after inhibitory neurotransmitters
(eg, GABA, glycine) act on the neuron to increase Cl membrane conductance
(hyperpolarization).
(Choice E) The intracellular concentration of MRNA increases during cellular states of
elevated protein synthesis (eg, during cell division).
(Choice F) Nitric oxide (NO) is a paracrine signaling molecule with a lifetime of a few
seconds. It can freely cross cell membranes and functions as a critical component of
endothelium-mediated vasodilation. NO is synthesized from arginine and O, by the enzyme

NO-synthase.
