Researchers lyse human cells and isolate a specific messenger RNA template using gel
electrophoresis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction is then used to synthesize
complementary DNA (cDNA) from the RNA template. Next, the cDNA is modified into an

expression vector containing an optimized bacterial promoter, ribosomal binding site, and
terminator sequence. After insertion of the vector into appropriate bacterial hosts, the
transformed bacteria are cultured in a bioreactor and produce large quantities of a protein
containing a domain that binds to a specific DNA sequence. This protein is most likely the
receptor for which of the following hormones?

(©) A. Glucagon

©) B. Growth hormone

©) C. Insulin

©) D. Insulin-like growth factor
|) E. Parathyroid hormone

() F. Progesterone
