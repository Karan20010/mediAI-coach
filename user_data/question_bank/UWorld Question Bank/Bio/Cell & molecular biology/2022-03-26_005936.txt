Glucose is the major source of energy for all cells of the body. In the majority of tissues,
glucose transport occurs along its concentration gradient, from higher concentrations outside
the cell toward lower concentrations inside the cell. However, glucose cannot passively diffuse
across the cell membrane in any significant amount and requires carrier proteins to aid its
crossing. Transport across the cell membrane by carrier proteins (which undergo
conformational changes as the substrate is transported, unlike channel proteins) is termed
carrier-mediated transport. Transport that is facilitated by transmembrane proteins without the

expenditure of energy is called facilitated diffusion.

Transmembrane carrier proteins that belong to the GLUT family transport glucose by facilitated
diffusion. These proteins are stereoselective and preferentially catalyze the entrance of D-
glucose rather than L-glucose into cells. GLUT4 is the insulin-sensitive transporter found in
skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. In these cells, the GLUT4 protein is stored in
cytoplasmic vesicles. Under the influence of insulin, the transporter protein is incorporated into
the cell membrane. An increased number of transporters in the membrane leads to an
increased rate of glucose uptake by the cells. Another important glucose transporter is
GLUT2. It facilitates export of glucose from the liver, small intestine, and kidneys into the
circulation and also helps to control insulin secretion in the pancreas.
