(Choice B) If the chloride equilibrium potential is -70 mV and the resting membrane potential
is -70 mV, then chloride would need to be the only membrane permeable ion with no
contribution from other ions. Chloride, in reality, plays little role in the determination of the
membrane potential.

(Choice C) High calcium conductance would make the resting membrane potential positive,
and the question stem states that the membrane potential is -70 mV.

(Choice D) High potassium conductance does occur at rest and is the largest contributor to
the resting membrane potential. Chloride plays little to no role in the determination of the
resting membrane potential.

(Choice E) If a high potassium conductance were the only contributor to the resting
membrane potential, then the membrane potential would be the same as the potassium
equilibrium potential.

Educational Objective:
The resting membrane potential is the difference in the electrical charges across the cell
membrane under steady-state conditions. The ions that are most permeable to the cell
