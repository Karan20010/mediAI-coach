The resting potential refers to the difference in charge across the cell membrane at rest (when
there is no signaling activity). The membrane prevents the free diffusion of ions, and generally
there is an excess of positive ions outside the cell and an excess of negative ions in the
cytoplasm. This separation of positive and negative charges across the cell membrane gives
rise to an electrical potential difference that ranges from -60 to -80 mV; the typical resting
membrane potential of a cell is -70 mV.

The cytoplasm of a typical cell is characterized by a low concentration of Na and high
concentration of K. The extracellular fluid is inversely rich in Na and low in K. This difference
in Na and K concentration is maintained by the Na,K-ATPase, which pumps three Na ions out
of the cell for every 2 K ions allowed into the cell.
