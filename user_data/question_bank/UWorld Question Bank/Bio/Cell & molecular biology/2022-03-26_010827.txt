Molecular biologists perform a series of experiments to characterize the electrophysiologic
properties of human muscle cells. The resting membrane potential for an isolated muscle cell
is determined to be -70 mV. The equilibrium potentials for important ions under normal
physiologic conditions are as follows:

E,. = + 60 mV
E, =- 90 mV
E,=-75 mV
E.. = + 125 mV
Ey, = 0 mV

If physiologic conditions are maintained, which of the following ions would most likely flow out
of the cell after opening of their respective ion channels?

|) A. Magnesium and calcium
©) B. Magnesium and chloride

(>) C. Potassium and chloride
