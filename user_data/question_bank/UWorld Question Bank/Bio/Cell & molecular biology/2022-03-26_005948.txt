(Choice A) Simple diffusion refers to the movement of particles along their concentration
gradient directly through the cell membrane. Transport of gases (O, and CO.) occurs via

simple diffusion, as the membrane is very permeable to small, nonpolar molecules.

(Choice B) Endocytosis allows for cellular uptake through the formation of membrane-bound,
typically clathrin-coated, vesicles. Uptake of cholesterol by cells occurs by means of receptor-
mediated endocytosis (mediated by the LDL receptor).

(Choices D and E) Active transport refers to the movement of a substance against its
concentration gradient. This process requires energy as well as transport proteins. In primary
active transport, the energy required for transport against the concentration gradient is
provided by the hydrolysis of ATP. In secondary active transport, this energy is generated by
co-transport of a separate substance down its concentration gradient. Transport of glucose
against the concentration gradient occurs via the Na/glucose symporter, which is found in the
intestinal and renal tubular epithelium and is used to transfer glucose intracellularly from the

lumen.
