cells). Ribosomes attach to the RER via the translocon, a protein complex containing
ribophorins that bind the large 60S subunit.
(Choice A) ATP is produced in the cytosol during glycolysis and in the mitochondria during
oxidative phosphorylation. The proteins in both of these cellular compartments are

synthesized by free ribosomes in the cytosol.

(Choices B and E) Steroid hormone synthesis and drug detoxification are performed by
various proteins found within the smooth ER (SER). The SER does not bind to ribosomes as it
lacks the translocon complex.

Educational objective:

The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is covered with ribosomes and is involved in the
transfer of proteins to the cell membrane and extracellular space. The RER is well developed
in protein-secreting cells. The smooth ER lacks surface ribosomes and functions in lipid
synthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and detoxification of harmful substances.
