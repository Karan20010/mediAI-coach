(Choice A) DNA methylation silences gene transcription so that the affected protein would be
completely absent. A pathologic example of DNA methylation is the inhibition of tumor
suppressor genes as a mechanism for cancer development.

(Choice C) A defect in protein folding, as seen with the CFTR protein in cystic fibrosis, would
result in abnormal protein functioning. Protein concentration may be normal or low due to
more rapid degradation of the abnormal protein.

(Choices D and E) Splicing mutations can result in inappropriate removal of exons or
persistence of introns; this creates aberrant mRNA that is presented for translation and results
in production of an abnormal protein. Similarly, a defect in translation results in insufficient or
abnormal protein synthesis, which is reflected both in the serum and intracellularly.
