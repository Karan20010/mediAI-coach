(Choice A) Heterochromatin is condensed and methylated DNA that has a low level of
transcriptional activity. In contrast to heterochromatin, euchromatin (loosely arranged
chromatin) has very high levels of transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation promotes the
formation of euchromatin.

(Choice B) Vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation is critical for the functioning of clotting
factors II, VII, IX, and X, and of the anticoagulative proteins C and S. Warfarin inhibits
carboxylation of these proteins.

(Choice C) The hepatic processing of bilirubin is accomplished in three key steps: carrier-
mediated passive uptake of bilirubin at the sinusoidal membrane; conjugation of bilirubin with
glucuronic acid in the endoplasmic reticulum; and active biliary excretion of the water-soluble,
nontoxic bilirubin-glucuronides. Disruption of this process occurs in Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a
condition in which patients lack the enzyme needed to catalyze bilirubin glucuronidation.

(Choice D) Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group (PO,°*) to a protein or other
organic molecule. Phosphorylation is commonly involved in the regulation of enzymatic
activity.
