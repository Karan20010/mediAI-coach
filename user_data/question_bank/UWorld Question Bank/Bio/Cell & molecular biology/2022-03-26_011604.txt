Educational objective:

The phosphoinositol second messenger system begins with ligand-receptor binding and G,-
protein activation leading to activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC then hydrolyzes
phosphatidyl inositol bisphosphate and forms diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (IP:).

Finally, IP; activates protein kinase C via an increase in intracellular Caz.
