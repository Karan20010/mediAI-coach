This patient likely has glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, an X-
linked recessive disorder causing hemolytic anemia and jaundice in response to oxidant
stressors (eg, sulfonamide & antimalarial drugs, infection). Heinz bodies (oxidized hemoglobin
conglomerates) precipitate in red blood cells and are removed by splenic macrophages,
leaving behind characteristic bite cells.

G6PD is an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. It generates the reducing agent
NADPH, which is essential for detoxification of hydrogen peroxide produced by partial
reduction of molecular oxygen in red blood cells. In the absence of NADPH, reduced
glutathione (the molecule required for reduction of hydrogen peroxide to water) remains in an
oxidized state, and red blood cells become susceptible to oxidative damage.

Glutathione reductase catalyzes the reduction of oxidized glutathione. Its absence leads to
an inability to use NADPH to reduce glutathione, resulting in a clinical scenario similar to
G6PD deficiency.

(Choice A) Bisphosphoglycerate mutase is an enzyme unique to red blood cells and placental
cells. It catalyzes the production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, a molecule that binds to
hemoglobin and increases offloading of oxygen in the tissues.
