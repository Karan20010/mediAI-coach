(Choice A) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a collection of heritable disorders of connective tissue
characterized by skin and joint hypermobility. Like those with Marfan syndrome, these patients
are at risk for aortic rupture. However, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome affects the formation and
extracellular structuring of collagen rather than microfibrils.

(Choice B) Homocystinuria is a rare inherited metabolic disorder due to cystathionine
synthase deficiency. It is characterized by very high circulating homocysteine levels,
marfanoid habitus, and increased risk for premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

(Choice D) Osteogenesis imperfecta results from defects in the genes encoding type |
collagen, a major component of bones. Defects in type | collagen in osteogenesis imperfecta
result in reduced bone mass and fragility fractures. Other manifestations of the disease
include blue sclera, dental abnormalities, and hearing loss.

(Choice E) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a disorder of tubular epithelial
cells. It causes enlargement of the kidneys with numerous parenchymal cysts. Patients are
also at risk for cardiac valvular disorders and ruptured cerebral aneurysms.

(Choice F) Deficiency of vitamin C (scurvy) causes impaired hydroxylation of proline and
lysine residues in collagen. Clinical features include skin fragility, easy bleeding, and poor

dentition.
