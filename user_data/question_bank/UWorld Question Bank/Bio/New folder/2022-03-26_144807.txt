The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relationship between the partial

pressure of oxygen in the blood and the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. The partial

pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated (P..) is a value used as a

conventional measure of hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. The P.. is about 26 mm Hg in

normal individuals. A P., shift from 26 to 20 mm Hg indicates that the affinity of hemoglobin

for oxygen is increased (left shift of the oxygen dissociation curve).

Mutations that cause production of hemoglobin with high oxygen affinity (eg, hemoglobins
Chesapeake and Kempsey) reduce the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen within the
peripheral tissues. Low oxygen levels stimulate the kidneys to increase erythropoietin
synthesis, which results in a compensatory erythrocytosis that helps maintain normal
oxygen delivery. Therefore, patients with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins are typically
asymptomatic.

(Choice B) Sickle cell disease can result in hypoxia-induced hemolysis due to the ability of
deoxygenated hemoglobin S to polymerize and cause excessive erythrocyte sickling and
irreversible cell membrane damage. The oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin S is
shifted to the right (| oxygen affinity) due to the stabilizing effects of polymerization on the

deoxygenated form.
