In healthy children and adults, the predominant hemoglobin is hemoglobin A (HbA), which
contains a pair of alpha and beta globulins. However, small quantities of other hemoglobin
types are also present; these include hemoglobin A2 (HbA2), which contains a pair of alpha
and delta globulins, and hemoglobin F (HbF), which contains a pair of alpha and gamma
globulins.

In homozygous sickle cell disease (sickle cell anemia), there are point mutations in both
beta globulin genes that substitute valine for glutamate at position 6. This generates a new
type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS), which is composed of a pair of alpha and a
pair of beta sickle globulins. HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, reducing erythrocyte
deformability and promoting painful vasoocclusion and chronic hemolysis.

Because patients with sickle cell anemia have mutations in both beta globulin genes, they are
unable to produce HbA (Choices B, C, and D). However, forms of normal hemoglobin that
do not contain beta globulin (eg, HbF, HbA2) are present at normal or mildly increased levels.
Raising the concentration of these normal hemoglobins is particularly helpful because it dilutes
HbS, preventing it from polymerizing. Therefore, hydroxyurea, which increases HbF
production, is often administered to limit symptoms and complications of the disease.
