Malignant cells typically contain a number of chromosomal translocations, deletions, or
duplications that result in deregulation of gene expression and production of novel fusion
proteins. Cytogenic analysis of tumor cells often demonstrates characteristic chromosomal
abnormalities that may aid diagnosis, treatment selection, and estimation of prognosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a highly sensitive cytogenetic test that can
identify the presence of chromosomal duplications and large deletions and
translocations. FISH probes are single-stranded DNA segments that are a few hundred
kilobases in length; they are added to the cell of interest and anneal to complementary regions
of the cell chromosome, which allows the area of interest to be identified visually.

FISH is far more sensitive than traditional karyotyping (chromosome banding) and can be
applied to both dividing (metaphase) and nondividing (interphase) cells. It is often used to
identify large structural chromosomal abnormalities such as the BCR-ABL1 fusion of t(9;22) in
chronic myeloid leukemia. However, small chromosomal insertions and deletions cannot be
identified by FISH (because the probe size is somewhat large), and chromosomal inversions
will be missed because FISH can only identify the presence or absence of a chromosomal
segment, not the order in which it is coded.
