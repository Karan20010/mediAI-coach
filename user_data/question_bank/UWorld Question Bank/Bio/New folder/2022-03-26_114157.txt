(Choice A) Treatment of most urea cycle disorders involves supplemental arginine. Arginine
administration increases production of downstream water-soluble intermediate metabolites
(eg, ornithine, citrulline), facilitating nitrogen disposal and decreasing plasma ammonia levels.

(Choice B) Cobalamin (vitamin B,.) deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia, neurologic
changes including peripheral neuropathy, and elevated plasma levels of homocysteine (a
prothrombotic substance). Supplementation of cobalamin is recommended to lower
homocysteine levels in patients with hyperhomocysteinemia.

(Choice C) Pyridoxine (vitamin B.) is involved in the transamination and decarboxylation
steps in amino acid metabolism as well as heme and neurotransmitter synthesis.
Supplemental pyridoxine is typically prescribed in conjunction with drugs known to interfere
with vitamin B, metabolism (eg, isoniazid, penicillamine).

(Choice D) Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency results in phenylketonuria because
tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor for phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylalanine levels can be
reduced by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation in patients with tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency.

Educational objective:
