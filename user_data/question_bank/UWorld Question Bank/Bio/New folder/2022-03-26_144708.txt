(Choices A and D) Deficiencies in aminolevulinate (ALA) dehydratase and PBG deaminase
do not result in photosensitivity because the metabolites that accumulate are not
porphyrinogens or porphyrins. PBG deaminase deficiency is seen with acute intermittent
porphyria (classically presenting with abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric manifestations).

(Choice B) Deficiency of ALA synthase will result in a decrease in formation of all porphyrins.
This deficiency will not result in porphyria but will lead to a decrease in heme synthesis and
concurrent hypochromic, microcytic anemia. Pyridoxal phosphate (vitamin B,) is the cofactor
required for activity of ALA synthase; therefore, pyridoxine deficiency can result in microcytic
hypochromic anemia.

(Choice C) Bilirubin glucuronyl transferase is a hepatic enzyme responsible for the
conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronide, improving solubility for biliary excretion. A decrease
in glucuronyl transferase results in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Educational objective:

Enzyme deficiencies of the early steps in porphyrin synthesis cause neuropsychiatric
manifestations without photosensitivity, whereas late step derangements lead to
photosensitivity. Photosensitivity manifests as vesicle and blister formation on sun-exposed
areas as well as edema, pruritus, pain, and erythema.
