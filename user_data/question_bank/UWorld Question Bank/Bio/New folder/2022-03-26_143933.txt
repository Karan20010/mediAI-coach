Educational objective:

Isoniazid inhibits pyridoxine phosphokinase, leading to impaired activation of pyridoxine
(vitamin B,). Pyridoxine is a cofactor for 6-aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme that
catalyzes the rate-limiting step of heme synthesis. Inhibition of this step can result in

sideroblastic anemia.
