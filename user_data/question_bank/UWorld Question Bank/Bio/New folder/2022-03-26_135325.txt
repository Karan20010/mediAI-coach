(Choice A) Erythrocyte glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) catalyzes the rate-
limiting step in the pentose phosphate pathway, which is necessary for production of NADPH
and proper functioning of the erythrocyte antioxidant system. Decreased G6PD levels cause
intermittent hemolytic anemia due to oxidative stress.

(Choices C and E) The metabolism of ethanol to acetyl-CoA consumes NAD- and increases
NADH/NAD;; therefore, NADH would likely be elevated in this patient. In addition, without
NAD- and thiamine, pyruvate dehydrogenase is unable to convert pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and
instead diverts pyruvate to the anaerobic glycolysis pathway, which ultimately increases (not
decreases) lactate production.

(Choice D) Methylmalonic acid, a product of fatty acid oxidation, is converted to succinyl-CoA
by the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (and uses vitamin B,, as a cofactor).

Consequently, methylmalonic acid levels are increased in vitamin B,. deficiency.
