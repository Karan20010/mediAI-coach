entirely responsible for the increase in renal acid excretion seen with chronic acidosis.

(Choices A and C) Alanine and aspartate are glucogenic amino acids. Alanine is
metabolized in the liver to produce pyruvate and aspartate can be readily interconverted with
oxaloacetate.

(Choice B) Arginine is a urea cycle intermediate that helps to remove nitrogenous waste
products (eg, ammonium) from the blood. Hepatic metabolism of arginine results in the
production of urea and ornithine.

(Choice E) Histidine, an essential amino acid, is converted to histamine by histidine
decarboxylase. Histamine is involved in the acute inflammatory response and gastric acid
secretion; it also functions as a neurotransmitter.

Educational objective:

Acidosis stimulates renal ammoniagenesis, a process by which renal tubular epithelial cells
metabolize glutamine to glutamate, generating ammonium that is excreted in the urine and
bicarbonate that is absorbed into the blood. This process is responsible for the vast majority of
renal acid excretion in chronic acidotic states.
