(Choice A) Acetylcholine is a neuromuscular junction neurotransmitter synthesized from
choline and acetyl-CoA by choline acetyltransferase. In myasthenia gravis, production of
antibodies against acetylcholine receptors leads to muscle weakness.

(Choice B) Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is an inhibitor of presynaptic transmission in
the central nervous system that is formed by glutamate decarboxylation, a reaction catalyzed
by glutamate decarboxylase. Phenobarbital, an antiepileptic medication, potentiates GABA
activity to decrease or cease seizure activity.

(Choice C) Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that is synthesized from glutamine by
the enzyme glutaminase. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor
noncompetitive antagonist that blocks glutamate, which can result in anesthesia, sedation, and
memory loss.

Educational objective:

Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH,) is a cofactor used by hydroxylase enzymes in the synthesis of
tyrosine, dopamine, and serotonin. Phenylketonuria can result from BH, deficiency due to
dihydropteridine reductase deficiency. Intellectual disability is the hallmark of this condition
and results in neurotransmitter (eg, serotonin) deficiency and hyperphenylalanemia.
Treatment involves a low phenylalanine diet and BH, supplementation.
