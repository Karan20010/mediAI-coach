After tropoelastin is formed, it is secreted into the extracellular space where it interacts with
microfibrils (fibrillin) that function as a scaffold. Next, lysyl oxidase, a copper-dependent
enzyme, oxidatively deaminates some of the lysine residues of tropoelastin, facilitating the
formation of desmosine cross-links between neighboring polypeptides that hold the elastin
molecules together. These cross-links, along with the high content of nonpolar (hydrophobic)
amino acids, account for the rubber-like properties of elastin.
