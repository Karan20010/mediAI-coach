Educational objective:

Contraction initiation in cardiac and smooth muscle cells is dependent on extracellular calcium
influx through L-type calcium channels, which can be prevented by calcium channel blockers
(eg, verapamil). Skeletal muscle is resistant to calcium channel blockers, as calcium release
by the sarcoplasmic reticulum is triggered by a mechanical interaction between L-type and
RyR calcium channels.
