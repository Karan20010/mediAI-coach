In contrast to GLUT-4, GLUTs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are always present on the plasma membrane,
regardless of insulin levels, and are responsible for insulin-independent glucose transport
(sample A).
¢ GLUT-1 contributes to basal glucose transport in erythrocytes and at the blood-brain
barrier.
¢ GLUT-2 is present in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, and at the basolateral membrane
of renal tubules and small intestinal mucosa. It plays a role in absorption of dietary
glucose, reabsorption of glucose from renal tubules, hepatic glucose regulation, and
sensitivity of beta cells to circulating glucose.
¢ GLUT-3 is involved in placental and neuronal glucose transport.

¢ GLUT-5 is a fructose transporter found in spermatocytes and the gastrointestinal tract.
