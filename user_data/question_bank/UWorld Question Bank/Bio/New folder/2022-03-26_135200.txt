Thiamine (vitamin B,) participates in glucose metabolism and is a cofactor for the following
enzymes:
¢ Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate (glycolysis end product) into acetyl-
CoA, which then enters the citric acid cycle
e Alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, an enzyme of the citric acid cycle
¢ Branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase, which is essential for the catabolism of
branched-chain amino acids (eg, leucine, isoleucine, valine)

¢ Transketolase, an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway that helps convert ribulose-
5-phosphate (derived from glucose) to glycolysis intermediates (eg, glyceraldehyde-3-

phosphate)
