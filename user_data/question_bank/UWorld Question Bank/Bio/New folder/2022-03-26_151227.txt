Biotin (vitamin B,) is an important cofactor for several carboxylase enzymes. It functions as
a CO, carrier and plays an essential role in carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. In
the liver, the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis requires pyruvate
carboxylase and biotin.

Biotin deficiency is rare but can occur secondary to poor diet, excessive raw egg white
consumption (due to high levels of biotin-binding avidin in egg whites), and congenital

disorders of biotin metabolism. Patients with biotin deficiency present with nonspecific

symptoms, including changes in mental status, myalgias, anorexia, and chronic dermatologic
changes such as macular dermatitis. Biotin-deficient individuals can also develop metabolic
acidosis as a result of increased conversion of pyruvate to lactic acid.

(Choice A) Niacin (vitamin B;), in the form of NADP-, is used to oxidize glucose-6-phosphate
in the pentose phosphate pathway, generating ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH in the process.
(Choice B) Thiamine (vitamin B,), riboflavin (vitamin B,), niacin (vitamin B;), pantothenic acid
(vitamin B;), and lipoic acid are the 5 cofactors required by the mitochondrial enzyme complex
pyruvate dehydrogenase. In their absence, the metabolism of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is not
possible.
