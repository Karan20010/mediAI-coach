Educational objective:

Vitamin K is a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme that activates coagulation
factors Il, VII, IX, and X via posttranslational gamma carboxylation. Intestinal diseases
associated with malabsorption (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) are a risk factor for vitamin K
deficiency, which typically presents with mucosal bleeding, bruising, and prolonged PT and
PTT (if severe).
