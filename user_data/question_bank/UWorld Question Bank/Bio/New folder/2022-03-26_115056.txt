Thiamine deficiency causes infantile and adult beriberi as well as Wernicke-Korsakoff
syndrome (confusion, ataxia, oculomotor abnormalities, and permanent memory deficits).
Manifestations of infantile beriberi appear at age 2-3 months and include a fulminant cardiac
syndrome with cardiomegaly, tachycardia, cyanosis, dyspnea, and vomiting. Adult beriberi is
categorized as dry or wet depending on cardiac involvement. Dry beriberi is characterized by
symmetrical peripheral neuropathy of the distal extremities, with resulting sensory and motor
impairments. Wet beriberi includes the addition of cardiac involvement (cardiomyopathy,
high-output congestive heart failure, peripheral edema, and tachycardia). Central nervous
system involvement (ie, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome) occurs primarily with heavy alcohol
use.
