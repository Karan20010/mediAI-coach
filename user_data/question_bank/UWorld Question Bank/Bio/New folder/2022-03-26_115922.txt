This patient's multiple previous hospitalizations for alcohol intoxication and easy bruising are
indicative of chronic alcohol use. Patients with this condition are frequently deficient in
thiamine, a necessary cofactor for several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism,
including pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and transketolase
(Choices A, B, E, F, and G).
The administration of glucose to thiamine-deficient patients can rapidly deplete the small
amount of circulating thiamine. This can result in neuronal injury within highly metabolic brain
regions, leading to the classic triad of acute Wernicke encephalopathy seen in this patient:

¢ Encephalopathy (eg, confusion)

¢ Oculomotor dysfunction (eg, horizontal nystagmus)

¢ Ataxia (eg, unsteady gait)
(Choices C and H) The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde
dehydrogenase consumes NAD: and increases the NADH/NAD- ratio. This skewed ratio
inhibits enzymatic pathways requiring NAD- (eg, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, isocitrate
dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase), and as a result, the entire citric acid cycle is typically
impaired in intoxicated patients. However, this patient has the classic findings of Wernicke

encephalopathy, which is caused by thiamine (not NAD*) depletion; the only thiamine-
