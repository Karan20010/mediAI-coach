Pellagra ("rough skin" in Italian vernacular) is due to niacin deficiency and is characterized
by 3 Ds: dermatitis, diarrhea, and dementia:

¢ Dermatitis is bilateral and symmetric on sun-exposed areas of the body and is
characterized by rough, thick, scaly skin.

¢ Diarrhea is due to atrophy (and occasional ulceration) of columnar epithelium of the
gastrointestinal tract.

¢ Dementia is due to neuronal degeneration in the brain and spinal cord, with lesions like
those associated with pernicious anemia.

Niacin (nicotinic acid, or vitamin B;) is an essential component of the coenzymes NAD and
NADP, which participate in redox metabolism. Specifically, NAD functions as a coenzyme for
dehydrogenases involved in the metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids; NADP is
crucial in the hexose-monophosphate shunt of glucose metabolism and for biosynthesis of
cholesterol and fatty acids.
