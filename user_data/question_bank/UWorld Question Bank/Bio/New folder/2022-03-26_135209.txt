Therefore, thiamine deficiency impairs glucose utilization, which can have catastrophic
effects on the CNS as the brain always requires some glucose.

Thiamine deficiency is often diagnosed clinically in patients with a history of heavy alcohol use
or malnutrition and signs of Wernicke encephalopathy; the diagnosis can be confirmed with a
baseline erythrocyte transketolase activity that is low but increases after the addition of
thiamine pyrophosphate. Treatment involves thiamine supplementation with glucose; glucose
administration alone may precipitate or worsen Wernicke encephalopathy due to rapid
thiamine consumption.
