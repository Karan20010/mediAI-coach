= hemoglobin and increases offloading of oxygen in the tissues.

5 (Choices C and D) Deficiency of the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase and pyruvate kinase

: leads to hemolytic anemia due to lack of ATP generation. However, these conditions would

& not present with bite cells and the hemolysis is not associated with exposure to oxidant

= stressors.

= (Choice E) Transketolase, along with transaldolase, catalyzes the nonoxidative reactions of

43 the pentose phosphate pathway, producing the ribose sugar necessary for nucleotide

synthesis. The reducing equivalent NADPH is not generated in this portion of the pathway.

Educational objective:
is Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency causes hemolytic anemia and jaundice

secondary to increased oxidative stress due to the lack of NADPH. Glutathione reductase
21 deficiency has a similar clinical consequence as its absence results in an inability to utilize
NADPH to reduce glutathione.
