By contrast, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is characterized by numerous ribosomes
on the outer membrane. The RER plays an important role in the synthesis and modification of
targeted proteins, including secretable polypeptide hormones. Some of the clinically
significant syndromes due to overproduction of peptide hormones by the RER include:

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (characterized by increased water
reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts), often abbreviated SIADH, due to overproduction
of vasopressin (Choice A)

Hypoglycemia due to overproduction of insulin by certain pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors (insulinomas) (Choice B)

Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastric acid hypersecretion and recurrent peptic ulcer) due to
excess secretion of gastrin from pancreatic or small intestine gastrinomas (Choice D)

Galactorrhea (pathologic mammary milk production) due to a prolactin-secreting lactotroph
pituitary adenoma (Choice E)

Educational objective:

The initial step in the synthesis of steroid hormones is the conversion of cholesterol to
pregnenolone in the mitochondria. The remainder of steroidogenesis occurs in the smooth
endoplasmic reticulum. Steroid-producing cells contain a well-developed smooth endoplasmic
