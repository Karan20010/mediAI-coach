(Choice A) Steroid and thyroid hormones bind to intracellular receptors. Once these
receptors are activated, they subsequently bind to the promoter region of target genes to
modify transcription.

(Choice B) Several hormones (eg, PTH, ACTH, TSH, ADH [V2 receptor]) activate adenylyl
cyclase after binding to G protein-coupled receptors on the cell membrane. Adenylyl cyclase
converts ATP to cyclic AMP, which subsequently activates protein kinase A.

(Choices C and D) Various hormones (eg, GnRH, TRH, angiotensin II, ADH [V1 receptor])
function by binding to G protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C. Activated
phospholipase C hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate to inositol triphosphate (IP;)
and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP; mobilizes calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum, and DAG

directly activates protein kinase C.

Educational objective:

Growth hormone binds to cell surface receptors, leading to intracellular activation of the JAK-
STAT pathway. Cytokines (eg, interferon) and hematopoietic growth factors (eg,
erythropoietin, G-CSF) also use this pathway.
