(Choice A) Some chemotherapeutic medications alter gene expression by affecting
epigenetic modifications (eg, DNA methylation). Azacitidine, used to treat myelodysplastic
syndrome, inhibits DNA methyltransferase, leading to hypomethylation and increased
expression of tumor suppressor genes.

(Choice B) RNA processing (posttranscriptional modification) includes 5’ capping,
polyadenylation, and splicing. Targeting splicing machinery is a new approach for treating
several neoplastic/genetic diseases; for example, eteplirsen may be used to treat Duchenne

muscular dystrophy.

(Choice D) Certain chemotherapeutic agents (eg, dactinomycin, doxorubicin) interfere with
transcription by intercalating in DNA, therefore preventing RNA synthesis.

(Choice E) Asparaginase, used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma,
interferes with protein translation within the leukemic cells by reducing the amount of
asparagine available.

Educational objective:

Vitamin K is a cofactor for gamma-glutamyl carboxylase, an enzyme that activates coagulation
factors Il, VII, IX, and X via posttranslational gamma carboxylation. Intestinal diseases

associated with malabsorption (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) are a risk factor for vitamin K Activate V
