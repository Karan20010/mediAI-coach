Explanation

Dietary energy comes predominantly from protein, carbohydrate, and fat. Metabolism yields 4
Calories (Cal) per gram of protein or carbohydrate and 9 Cal per gram of fat. Ethanol yields 7
Cal per gram.

This patient is instructed to consume 3000 Cal per day, 900 (30%) of which are to be from
protein. Because 1 g of protein yields 4 Cal of energy, this patient should consume (900 Cal /4
Cal) = 225 g/day of protein.

Educational objective:
Metabolism of 1 g of protein or carbohydrate produces 4 Calories of energy; metabolism of 1 g
of fat produces 9 Calories.
