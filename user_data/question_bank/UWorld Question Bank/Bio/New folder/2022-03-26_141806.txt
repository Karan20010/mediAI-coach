A 17-year-old girl comes to the office for follow-up on anemia. She has taken iron
supplements regularly since being diagnosed with iron deficiency anemia 3 months ago.
However, the patient still feels fatigued and does not think that the supplements have improved
her symptoms. She has occasional gingival bleeding when brushing her teeth. Menses occur
every 27-28 days and last 7-8 days with heavy flow, sometimes requiring her to change pads
every hour. Platelet count is normal. Further evaluation reveals that the patient's platelets do
not agglutinate appropriately in response to ristocetin. When normal plasma is added to the
solution of patient platelets and ristocetin, appropriate platelet agglutination occurs. Which of
the following is most likely deficient in this patient?

©) A. Glycoprotein Ib receptors

() B. Glycoprotein IIb-Illa receptors
() C. Hageman factor

©) D. Thromboxane A2

©) E. Von Willebrand factor
