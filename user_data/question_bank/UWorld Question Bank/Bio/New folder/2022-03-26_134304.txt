Educational objective:

Insulin is an anabolic hormone that acts via receptor tyrosine kinase signaling to increase the
synthesis of glycogen, proteins, fatty acids, and nucleic acids. Tyrosine
kinase/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase stimulation promotes glycogen synthesis by activating
protein phosphatase, an enzyme that dephosphorylates (activates) glycogen synthase.
