(Choice A) In patients with metachromatic leukodystrophy, central nervous system
accumulation of cerebroside sulfate is caused by arylsulfatase A deficiency. Central and
peripheral demyelination leads to peripheral neuropathy and ataxia.

(Choice B) In Krabbe disease, galactocerebrosidase deficiency causes accumulation of
galactocerebroside and psychosine. Infants have developmental delay and/or regression,
axial hypotonia, limb stiffness, optic atrophy, and seizures.

(Choice C) In Fabry disease, a-galactosidase A deficiency causes globotriaosylceramide
(ceramide trihexoside) accumulation. Clinical manifestations begin in childhood with
neuropathic pain and dermatologic pathology (eg, telangiectasias, angiokeratomas).

(Choice D) Glucocerebroside accumulation occurs in Gaucher disease, an autosomal
recessive disorder of B-glucocerebrosidase deficiency. Patients typically have
hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and skeletal problems.

(Choice E) Patients with Tay-Sachs disease are deficient in B-hexosaminidase A, which leads
to GM2 accumulation in neurons. Neurologic regression and cherry-red macular spots are
classic symptoms (similar to Niemann-Pick disease), but hepatosplenomegaly is absent.
