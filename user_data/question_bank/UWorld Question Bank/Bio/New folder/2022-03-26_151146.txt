This newborn had elevated indirect bilirubin levels with jaundice that self-resolved in the
first week of life, findings consistent with benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

Normally, unconjugated bilirubin is released into the bloodstream upon breakdown of red blood
cells (RBCs) and taken up by the liver. Hepatic UDP glucuronosyltransferase then conjugates
bilirubin, which is secreted into bile and excreted into the intestines. Bacterial enzymes in the
intestines then reduce bilirubin to urobilinogen, allowing for excretion through the urine and
stool.

Benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is caused by several physiologic differences in bilirubin
metabolism in newborns as compared to those in older children and adults.
