Alkaptonuria is a relatively benign childhood disorder that is marked by severe arthritis in
adult life. This autosomal-recessive disorder is caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid
dioxygenase, which normally metabolizes homogentisic acid into maleylacetoacetate.
Accumulated homogentisic acid causes pigment deposits in connective tissue throughout the
body. During adulthood, these blue-black deposits become apparent in the sclerae and ear
cartilage. Deposits also occur in the large joints and spine, causing ankylosis, motion
restriction, and significant pain. A distinctive characteristic of alkaptonuria is that the urine of
these patients turns black when exposed to air due to oxidization of homogentisic acid.

(Choice B) Hyperuricemia can cause acute monoarticular gouty arthritis due to urate crystal
deposition in joints (usually the great toe or knee). These acute attacks resolve in days to
weeks and are not associated with connective tissue hyperpigmentation.

(Choice C) Osteoarthritis is due to combined genetic, metabolic, and mechanical factors that
result in defects in articular cartilage. Polyarticular joint involvement of the fingers (including
Heberden and Bouchard nodes), knees, hips, and spine classically occur. Joint pain typically
peaks in the afternoon or evening after activity, but osteoarthritis is not associated with the
blue-black deposits.
