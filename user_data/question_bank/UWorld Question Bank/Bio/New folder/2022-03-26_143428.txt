(Choice A) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is used to quantify antibodies or
antigens in a fluid.

(Choice B) Flow cytometry is often used in the diagnosis of leukemia. However, this laser-
based test evaluates surface markers (eg, CD5) on individual cells, not chromosomal
duplications.

(Choice D) Northern blotting is a technique that size-fractionates RNA in a gel and then
targets a specific mRNA sequence of interest. It can determine the quantity and size of a
particular MRNA section.

(Choice E) Western blotting is a technique that size-fractionates proteins in a gel and then
targets a specific protein using an antibody with a radiotracer/enzyme. It is often used to
confirm a positive ELISA test in the setting of HIV or Lyme disease infection.

Educational objective:

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can identify specific chromosomal translocations,
duplications, or deletions using a single-stranded, complementary DNA segment that is tagged
with a radiotracer. FISH is rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and can be used on tissues with
low mitotic rates. However, the targeted chromosomal abnormality must be somewhat large in

order to be identified.
