gluconeogenesis, leading to decreased conversion of alanine and other gluconeogenic
substrates to glucose.

(Choice A) Fatty acid synthesis is upregulated by insulin and high citrate levels (which
increase when acetyl-CoA is abundant, as with active glycolysis). Therefore, fatty acid
synthesis is likely to be upregulated in metabolic states in which fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
concentration is increased.

(Choice C) The conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate is catalyzed
by the enzyme PFK-1. This enzyme is allosterically activated by high levels of fructose-2,6-
bisphosphate, and so conversion would be increased.

(Choice D) Glycogen formation is stimulated by increased levels of insulin and glucose-6-
phosphate. Because elevated insulin levels also increase fructose 2,6-bisphosphate
formation, the rise of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels in hepatocytes is typically concurrent
with increased glycogen synthesis.

(Choice E) The rise in fructose-2,6-bisphosphate accelerates glycolysis, leading to increased
conversion of NAD: to NADH.
