Educational objective:

Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (SnRNPs) are important components of the spliceosome, a
molecule which removes introns from pre-mRNA during processing within the nucleus. Spinal
muscular atrophy is a disorder caused by mutations in the SMN7 gene, resulting in impaired
assembly of snRNPs in lower motor neurons. Infants often have flaccid paralysis due to
degeneration of anterior horn cells in the spinal cord.
