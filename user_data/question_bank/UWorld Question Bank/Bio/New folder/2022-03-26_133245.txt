This patient has easy bleeding/bruising, gingivitis, and follicular hyperkeratosis, findings
indicative of vitamin C deficiency (scurvy). This condition is rare in resource-rich regions but
can be seen in patients who are at risk for malnutrition (eg, alcohol use disorder, anorexia),
as in this case.

Vitamin C is a required cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine by prolyl and
lysyl hydroxylases, respectively, during collagen synthesis. The hydroxylated residues
(hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine) are essential for the formation of a stable triple helix
collagen structure as well as the cross-linking of collagen molecules, both of which contribute
to the tensile strength of collagen.

Impaired hydroxylation in vitamin C deficiency compromises collagen's tensile strength,
increasing capillary wall fragility and causing petechiae/ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding (eg,
nosebleeds), and perifollicular hemorrhages. Periodontal disease (gingival
erythema/edema/bleeding) and hyperkeratotic follicles (due to keratin plugging) with
coiled/corkscrew hairs are also common features. In addition, defective collagen production is
associated with poor wound healing, as seen in this patient with a chronic, noninfected ulcer.
