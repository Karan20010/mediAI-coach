(Choice A) Production of ketones in the presence of hypoglycemia is an appropriate
response in the fasting state, as ketones provide fuel for the brain. In this patient, the notable
family history and elevated serum methylmalonic acid level make methylmalonic acidemia
more likely than simple fasting or dehydration.

(Choice C) Fatty acid oxidation disorders, such as medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase
(MCAD) deficiency, can present with hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, and metabolic
acidosis, but these disorders lack an appropriate ketosis.

(Choice D) Urea cycle defects typically present with hyperammonemia without hypoglycemia
or ketosis.

(Choice E) Propionic acid levels are elevated in patients with methylmalonic acidemia due to
downstream enzymatic deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.
