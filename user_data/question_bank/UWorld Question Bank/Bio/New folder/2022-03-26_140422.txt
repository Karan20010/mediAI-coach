Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to amplify small fragments of DNA (eg, genes,
exons, noncoding regions) by repeated replication. Several elements are required for PCR.
The first is a source DNA template that includes the target region to be amplified (eg, BRCA7
exon 11) as well as flanking sequences adjacent to the target region. The oligonucleotide
sequence of these flanking regions must be known in order to make the primers necessary to
start PCR. However, the exact nucleotide sequence of the target region does not need to be
known (Choice D). A thermostable DNA polymerase (not denatured at high temperatures) is
then used to replicate the DNA template from a pool of supplied deoxynucleotide
triphosphates using the following 3 steps:
