(Choice A) Cobalamin is a necessary cofactor for methionine synthase, the enzyme that
transfers a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, forming methionine
and regenerating tetrahydrofolate. Cobalamin deficiency can cause folate to become trapped
in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate form, resulting in secondary folate deficiency.

(Choice B) Cytosine is a pyrimidine base. Unlike thymine, it is not dependent on folate and
can be synthesized in sufficient quantities under folate-deficient conditions.

(Choice C) Glutamine is a major source of nitrogen in the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine
bases. However, glutamine supplementation would not ameliorate the cellular apoptosis
induced by folate deficiency.

(Choice D) Homocysteine is an amino acid associated with endothelial cell injury and
vascular inflammation. Levels are elevated in folate deficiency due to impaired conversion into
methionine.

Educational objective:

Folate deficiency inhibits the synthesis of nucleic acids, particularly the formation of thymidine.
This leads to defective DNA synthesis and increased apoptosis affecting hemopoietic cells
(megaloblastic anemia). Thymidine supplementation bypasses the enzyme thymidylate

synthase and can reduce erythroid cell apoptosis.
