Fibrillin-1 is a major component of microfibrils that form a sheath around elastin fibers.
Microfibrils are abundant in blood vessels (eg, aortic media), periosteum, and the suspensory
ligaments of the lens. Fibrillin in the extracellular space acts as a scaffold for deposition of
elastin extruded from connective tissue cells. Defects in fibrillin-1 cause mechanical
weakening in the connective tissues and abnormal activation of transforming growth factor
beta.

Marfan syndrome is caused by an inherited defect in the fibrillin-1 gene. Patients with Marfan
syndrome can often be identified due to a characteristic body habitus, with long thin
extremities, loose joints, and long fingers (arachnodactyly). The cause of death in Marfan
syndrome is most often due to cardiovascular complications (eg, aortic root dilation,
dissection, and rupture).
