Educational objective:

Stress hyperglycemia is transiently elevated blood glucose levels in the context of severe
illness (eg, sepsis, burns, major hemorrhage) in patients without preexisting diabetes mellitus.
Cortisol and catecholamines released in response to severe metabolic stress act on the liver to

increase glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.
