A 66-year-old man comes to the office due to progressive vision impairment over the last year
that has begun to affect his ability to drive. He has difficulty reading road signs at night and
reports excessive glare from the headlights of oncoming cars. The patient has a long history
of hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Funduscopy reveals a diminished red reflex
bilaterally with obscuration of retinal detail. It is determined that the patient's condition is in
part due to intracellular accumulation of sorbitol. In healthy cells, this sugar alcohol is normally
metabolized into which of the following substances to facilitate excretion?
