The oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve describes the relationship between the partial
pressure of oxygen (x-axis) and the hemoglobin oxygen saturation (y-axis). Oxygen saturation
increases in a sigmoidal fashion as the pO, increases because of the increase in oxygen-
binding affinity that occurs after the first oxygen molecule binds to hemoglobin. As more
oxygen molecules bind to hemoglobin, the number of available binding sites decreases and
the curve eventually flattens out.

The partial pressure of oxygen in the blood at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated is known as
the P;, (dotted black line in diagram above); this value is a standard measure of hemoglobin's
affinity for oxygen and is about 26 mm Hg in normal individuals. A leftward shift of the
oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve occurs when hemoglobin has increased oxygen
affinity (ie, a lower P.,). Because decreased temperatures help to stabilize the bonds
between oxygen and hemoglobin, hypothermia increases hemoglobin's oxygen affinity and
shifts the dissociation curve to the left.
