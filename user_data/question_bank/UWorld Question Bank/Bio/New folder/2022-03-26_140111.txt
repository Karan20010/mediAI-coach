(Choice A) Bilirubin glucuronyl transferase, or uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronyl transferase
(UGT), is the enzyme necessary for bilirubin conjugation to glucuronic acid. Lack of UGT or
the use of medications that interfere with its activity impairs the liver's ability to conjugate
bilirubin.

(Choices B, D, and E) Ferrochelatase (inhibited by lead) is the final enzyme in the heme
synthetic pathway. Porphobilinogen deaminase (PBG deaminase) and uroporphyrinogen
decarboxylase (UROD) are also involved in heme production, not degradation; UROD
deficiency can be seen in porphyria cutanea tarda, the most common porphyria, and PBG
deaminase deficiency can be seen in acute intermittent porphyria.

Educational objective:

Heme oxygenase converts heme to biliverdin, a pigment that causes the greenish color to
develop in bruises several days after an injury.
