asymptomatic and often have mild hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly.

(Choice A) Deletions involving the alpha globin genes cause alpha thalassemia, which results
in imbalanced beta chain production and formation of beta tetramers (hemoglobin H) that
migrate further than HbA during electrophoresis.

(Choice C) Nonsense mutations introduce a stop codon within gene sequences, resulting in
the formation of truncated proteins. As a result of their decreased size, these proteins tend to
move further during electrophoresis.

(Choice D) Silent mutations are point mutations that have no effect on the protein formed. A
mutation from UCA to UCC does not result in any change in protein structure as both codons
result in the placement of serine into the growing polypeptide chain.

(Choice E) Trinucleotide expansions increase the number of trinucleotide repeats within a
gene, resulting in large, unstable proteins or alterations in the epigenetic effects. These
proteins would tend to move less during electrophoresis due to their increased size. However,
the hemoglobinopathies are not caused by trinucleotide expansions, as the hemoglobin genes
do not contain trinucleotide repeat regions.
