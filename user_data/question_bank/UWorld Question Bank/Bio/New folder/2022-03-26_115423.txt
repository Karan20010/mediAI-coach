The H- ions combine with bicarbonate ions (the primary form of COz in the blood) in the lungs
to facilitate the production of water (H.O) and CO,. The CO, is then transferred to the alveoli
and expired while oxygen is taken up by hemoglobin.

In the peripheral tissues, high levels of CO, create an increase in ambient acidity that shifts the
hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right and facilitates the unloading of O, (Bohr effect).
The CO, (and water) are converted into H: and HCO.-. The H- ions are carried by hemoglobin

while the HCO, is transferred to the plasma for transport back to the lungs.
