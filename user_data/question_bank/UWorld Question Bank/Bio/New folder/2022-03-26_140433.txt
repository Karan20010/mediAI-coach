1. Denaturing: Thermal separation of the DNA template is accomplished by exposing the
sample to high temperatures

2. Annealing: Primers combine with the denatured, single-stranded flanking ends of the
target region when the temperature is lowered

3. Elongation: DNA polymerase forms new daughter DNA strands in the 5' to 3' direction,

starting from the 3' end of each primer

These steps are repeated to obtain millions of copies of the target DNA segment in a short

period of time (exponential amplification).
