A 24-year-old woman is admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. She
started having right lower quadrant abdominal pain approximately 30 hours earlier but did not
go to the hospital because she thought the pain would subside on its own. The patient had no
food, only sips of water, during that time. Blood pressure is 115/72 mm Hg and pulse is
106/min. Mucous membranes are dry and there is tenderness in the right lower quadrant of
the abdomen. Laboratory evaluation shows mild leukocytosis, normal serum electrolytes,
borderline low serum glucose levels, and moderate ketones in the urine. Based on the
evaluation, it is suspected that this patient is utilizing ketone bodies as a significant reserve of
energy. Which of the following tissues cannot use this energy source?

A. Brain (13%)

JY B. Erythrocytes (79%)
C. Heart muscle (1%)
D. Renal cortex (1%)
