A 34-year-old woman with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections comes to the physician
with dysuria and increased urinary frequency. Her urine culture grows colonies of Gram-
negative bacteria. The bacteria are isolated and placed in a growth-enhancing nutrient
solution, where they undergo rapid cellular division. As they are actively dividing, the bacterial
cells are lysed and their DNA is extracted and purified. Analysis of the partially replicated DNA
fragments shows the presence of uracil. This finding is most likely mediated by which of the
following enzymes?

(©) A. DNA ligase

©, B. DNA polymerase |
© C. DNA polymerase III
©) D. Gyrase

©) E. Helicase
