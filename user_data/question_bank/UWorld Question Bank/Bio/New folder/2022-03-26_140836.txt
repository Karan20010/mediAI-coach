Glucose or hemin inhibit ALA synthase and are used in AIP management. PBG deaminase
deficiency by itself is generally not sufficient for development of AIP attacks (many patients
with PBG deaminase deficiency are asymptomatic), and PBG deaminase enzyme activity is
not directly affected by hemin infusion (Choice E).

(Choices A and D) Deficiencies of ALA dehydratase and ferrochelatase (inhibited by lead) are
seen with lead poisoning. Ferrochelatase deficiency is also seen with erythropoietic
protoporphyria, characterized by cutaneous photosensitivity beginning in early childhood.

(Choice C) Bilirubin glucuronyl transferase is a hepatic enzyme that is responsible for the
conjugation of bilirubin (byproduct of heme catabolism) with glucuronide, a polar molecule that
improves bilirubin solubility for subsequent biliary excretion. A decrease in glucuronyl
transferase activity results in unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

Educational objective:

Acute intermittent porphyria attacks are due to the accumulation of aminolevulinate (ALA) and
porphobilinogen (PBG), resulting from inherited PBG deaminase deficiency combined with ALA
synthase induction (typically due to certain medications, alcohol use, or a low-calorie diet).
Management with glucose or hemin inhibits ALA synthase activity.
