Educational objective:

Lack of vitamin D effect (eg, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D receptor mutation) causes
hypocalcemia due to inadequate calcium absorption. The compensatory rise in parathyroid
hormone (PTH) causes increased bone resorption, renal calcium reabsorption, and renal
phosphorus wasting. PTH also induces 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity, leading to elevated 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D levels.
