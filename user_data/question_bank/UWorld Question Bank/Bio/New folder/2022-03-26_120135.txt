This patient's constellation of symptoms (eg, malar rash, photosensitivity, Raynaud
phenomenon ["blue fingers"], fatigue) is consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus, an
autoimmune disease associated with anti-Smith antibodies (highly specific). Smith protein
normally complexes with small nuclear RNA (snRNA) in the cytoplasm, forming small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).

Transcription occurs in the nucleus and is catalyzed by 3 types of RNA polymerases, leading
to the formation of messenger RNA (mRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), transport RNA (tRNA),
and snRNA. RNA polymerase II synthesizes both mRNA and snRNA, the latter of which
combines with specific proteins to form snRNPs. mRNA synthesis occurs in 2 stages. During
the first, the DNA template is transcribed into a complementary strand of pre-mRNA. In the
second, pre-mRNA is processed into mature mRNA through the following steps:

1. RNA capping: Addition of a methylated guanine nucleotide to the 5' end.

2. RNA polyadenylation: Addition of several adenine nucleotides to the 3' end (poly-A tail).

3. RNA splicing: Removal of introns (noncoding regions) by spliceosomes, which consist
of snRNPs and other proteins.

Mature mRNA then transfers the genetic code to the cytoplasm and serves as a template for
protein synthesis (translation).
