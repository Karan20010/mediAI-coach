A 17-year-old boy who was recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus is found
unresponsive at home. His family reports that the patient did not feel good last night and
skipped dinner, but he still took his usual dose of insulin. Paramedics find that his fingerstick
blood glucose is 32 mg/dL and immediately administer intramuscular glucagon. Glucagon
binds to a transmembrane receptor in hepatocytes, which promotes binding of intracellular
GTP to a specific receptor-associated protein. This leads to further downstream signaling and
rapid metabolic changes within hepatocytes, including a rapid decrease in intracellular
glycogen stores and release of glucose into the blood. Which of the following is the most likely
mediator responsible for these effects?

A. cGMP-dependent protein kinase (18%)
B. Janus tyrosine kinase (6%)
C. Phosphodiesterase (3%)

YD. Protein kinase A (61%)

E. Tyrosine-specific protein kinase (10%)
