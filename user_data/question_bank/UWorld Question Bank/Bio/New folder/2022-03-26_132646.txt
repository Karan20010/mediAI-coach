The figure shows the volume of the intracellular (ICF) and extracellular (ECF) fluid
compartments (x-axis) and the osmolarity of the fluid in those compartments (y-axis).

This patient's recent head trauma is consistent with central diabetes insipidus due to
hypothalamic/pituitary damage. The resulting decrease in vasopressin secretion leads to
excessive free water excretion by the kidneys, causing hyperosmotic volume
contraction. This condition occurs when the loss of free water exceeds the loss of
electrolytes, resulting in increased osmolarity and contracted volumes in both the ICF and
ECF compartments. Hyperosmotic volume contraction can occur in the setting of diabetes
insipidus, decreased fluid intake (dehydration), and with profuse sweating (due to the
hypotonic nature of sweat).

(Choice A) Acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage (or diarrhea) would cause an isotonic loss of
ECF volume, with no effects on osmolarity or ICF volume. This is referred to as isosmotic
volume contraction.

(Choice B) The lack of aldosterone in adrenal insufficiency causes loss of NaCl with ECF

volume depletion (hyposmotic volume contraction). The low osmolarity of the ECF results in
shifting of free water into the ICF compartment, causing ICF expansion. ctivate V
