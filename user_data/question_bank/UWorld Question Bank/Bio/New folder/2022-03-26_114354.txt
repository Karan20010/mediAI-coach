(Choice A) Eosinophils function in defense against parasitic infections and are also
pathogenic in patients with asthma, allergy, hypereosinophilic syndromes, and vasculitides
such as Churg-Strauss syndrome.

(Choice B) Lymphocytes produce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that do not play a
role in gout.

(Choice D) Synovial cells and macrophages play a role in initiating the inflammatory response
in gouty arthritis. However, targeting these cells would not eliminate the inflammatory
amplification caused by neutrophils, which is the central mechanism involved in precipitating
an acute gouty attack.

(Choice E) Mast cell degranulation can be inhibited by medications such as cromolyn sodium,
which is used in conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis.

Educational objective:

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line therapy for treating acute gouty
arthritis. They inhibit cyclooxygenase and exert a broad anti-inflammatory effect that includes
inhibition of neutrophils. When NSAIDs are contraindicated (eg, peptic ulcer disease, renal
impairment), colchicine is useful in the acute management of gout as it inhibits neutrophil

chemotaxis and phagocytosis by preventing microtubule formation.
