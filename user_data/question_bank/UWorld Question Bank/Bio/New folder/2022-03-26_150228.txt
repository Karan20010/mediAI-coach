acid can deaminate C, A, and G. There are also spontaneous changes, such as deamination
of C to U and the constant low-level loss of purines via thermal disruption. Glycosylases are
enzymes that detect and remove abnormal bases from DNA, creating an empty sugar-
phosphate residue that is subsequently removed and replaced by the correct nucleotide (base
excision repair).

(Choice E) Exposure to ionizing radiation causes double-stranded DNA breaks that are
repaired by end-joining repair mechanisms. Non-homologous end joining, the main
mechanism in primates, is more prone to cause mutations than homologous recombination.

Educational objective:

Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease caused by abnormal nucleotide mismatch
repair. The mismatch repair system involves several genes, including MSH2 and MLH1, which
code for components of the human MutS and MutL homologs. Mutations in these 2 genes
account for around 90% of cases of Lynch syndrome.
