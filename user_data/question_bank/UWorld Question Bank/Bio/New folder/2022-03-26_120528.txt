The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an interconnected, membrane-bound network found in
almost all eukaryotic cells. It is highly metabolically active and plays a significant role in the
synthesis and modification of cellular components. The ER is recognizable on electron
microscopy as a flattened tubular or laminar structure near or adjacent to the nucleus.

The smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) is involved in the synthesis and processing of
hydrophobic compounds, including lipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol derivatives (eg,
steroid hormones). Cholesterol is initially converted to pregnenolone in the mitochondria and
then transferred to the SER, where the remaining steps of steroidogenesis occur. The SER
contains the enzymes (eg, 21-hydroxylase) required for steroid and phospholipid biosynthesis.

Steroid-producing cells (in the adrenals, gonads, and liver) characteristically contain a well-
developed SER. This patient is likely experiencing virilization due to an androgen-secreting
ovarian or adrenal tumor. Paraneoplastic syndromes can also occur due to overproduction of
other sex steroids, cortisol (ie, Cushing syndrome), or aldosterone.
