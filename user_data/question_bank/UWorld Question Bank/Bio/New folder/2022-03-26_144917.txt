Catabolism of isoleucine, valine, threonine, methionine, and odd-chain fatty acids normally
leads to formation of propionyl CoA, which is then converted to methylmalonyl CoA by biotin-
dependent carboxylation. Isomerization of methylmalonyl CoA through a vitamin B12-
dependent reaction forms succinyl CoA, which subsequently enters the TCA cycle. Mutations
in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase result in buildup of methylmalonic acid and propionic acid,
leading to a metabolic acidosis. Hypoglycemia results from overall increased metabolic rate
leading to increased glucose utilization and direct toxic inhibition of gluconeogenesis by the
organic acids. The presence of hypoglycemia leads to increased free fatty acid metabolism
that produces ketones, resulting in a further anion gap metabolic acidosis. Finally, organic
acids also directly inhibit the urea cycle, leading to hyperammonemia.

Complete deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase results in an anion gap metabolic acidosis,
hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hyperammonemia. These metabolic derangements manifest as
hypotonia, lethargy, vomiting, and respiratory distress (tachypnea due to acidosis) in the
neonatal period. Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of elevated urine methylmalonic
acid and propionic acid.
