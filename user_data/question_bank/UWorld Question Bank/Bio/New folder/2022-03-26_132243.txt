This patient's emphysema is likely due to alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Neutrophil-
secreted elastase is an endogenous proteolytic enzyme that hydrolyzes elastin within alveolar
walls. The liver synthesizes alpha-1 antitrypsin, a protein that inhibits neutrophil elastase and
prevents alveolar wall degradation, particularly in the lower airways. Patients with alpha-1
antitrypsin deficiency consequently develop excessive alveolar elastin degradation, which
clinically manifests with early-onset, lower lobeâ€”predominant emphysema.

Elastin is a fibrous connective tissue protein that provides elasticity to the skin, blood vessels,
and pulmonary alveoli. The fibers can stretch to several times their length and recoil back to

their original size once stretching forces are withdrawn. Elastin assembly is closely related to
that of collagen. Similar to collagen, elastin is synthesized as a large polypeptide precursor

(tropoelastin) composed of about 700, mostly nonpolar, amino acids (eg, glycine, alanine,
valine) (Choice D). Elastin also contains proline and lysine residues; however, in contrast to
those found in collagen, few of these amino acids are hydroxylated (Choice C).
