(Choice A) Bernard-Soulier syndrome (hereditary deficiency of GP Ib receptors) is
characterized by thrombocytopenia, enlarged platelets, and mucocutaneous bleeding. Platelet
agglutination to ristocetin will be abnormal and, because the deficiency is with GP Ib receptors
and not vWF, the addition of normal plasma will not correct the agglutination.

(Choice B) Hereditary deficiency of GP IIb/Illa receptors occurs in Glanzmann
thrombasthenia, which manifests with mucocutaneous bleeding. Platelet agglutination in
response to ristocetin is normal because the levels of VWF and GP Ib receptors are normal.

(Choice C) Congenital deficiency of factor XII (Hageman) causes marked PTT prolongation;
however, it does not cause clinical bleeding complications. Instead, patients may have a
tendency for thromboembolic complications for unclear reasons.

(Choice D) Thromboxane A2 deficiency is associated with aspirin treatment due to
irreversible inactivation of cyclooxygenase in platelets. The major effect is on GP IIb/IIla-
mediated platelet aggregation rather than GP Ib-mediated platelet adhesion; therefore, platelet
agglutination to ristocetin is normal.
