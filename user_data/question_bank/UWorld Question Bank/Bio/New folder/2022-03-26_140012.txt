Educational objective:

Tay-Sachs disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by B-hexosaminidase A
deficiency, which results in GM2 ganglioside accumulation in neuronal lysosomes. Key clinical
features include progressive neurodegeneration (eg, developmental regression), an

exaggerated startle reflex, and a cherry-red macular spot.
