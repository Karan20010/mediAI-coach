Question Id: 1889

An 18-year-old girl with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus comes to the emergency
department after several hours of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The patient reports
that she is on vacation visiting friends and has not taken insulin in the last 2 days. Physical
examination shows breath with fruity odor and dry mucosal membranes. Laboratory studies
show a blood glucose level of 452 mg/dL and high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis is
positive for ketones. It is determined that the patient's insulin deficiency is causing increased
production of gluconeogenic precursors that are subsequently converted to glucose in the
liver. Which of the following enzymes is most likely to provide these precursor substrates?

A. Acetyl CoA carboxylase (41%)

B. Acyl CoA synthetase (25%)

C. ATP citrate lyase (4%)

D. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (8%)
SY E. Glycerol kinase (19%)
