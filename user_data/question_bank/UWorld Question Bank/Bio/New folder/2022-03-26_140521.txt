Educational objective:

Hemoglobin S (HbS) aggregates in the deoxygenated state. HbS polymers form fibrous
strands that reduce red blood cell membrane flexibility and promote sickling. Sickling occurs
under conditions associated with anoxia including low pH and high levels of 2,3-
bisphosphoglycerate. These inflexible erythrocytes predispose to microvascular occlusion and
microinfarcts.
