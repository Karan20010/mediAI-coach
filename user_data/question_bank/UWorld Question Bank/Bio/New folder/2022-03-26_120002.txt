Glucagon exerts its effects through G protein-coupled receptors using the adenylate cyclase
second messenger system. G protein is a heterotrimer consisting of alpha, beta, and
gamma subunits associated with the intracellular domain of these transmembrane receptors.
The alpha subunit of the inactivated G protein is bound to GDP. On receptor activation, the
alpha subunit undergoes a conformational change, which releases GDP and binds GTP. GTP
binding allows the alpha subunit to dissociate from the remainder of the G protein complex.

There are multiple subtypes of alpha G proteins, each with different secondary effects. A
specific alpha subunit known as G, (present in glucagon, TSH, and PTH receptor complexes)
activates adenylate cyclase when released from the G protein complex. Adenylate cyclase
converts ATP to cAMP, which activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates
specific serine/threonine residues in various enzymes, leading to their activation or
deactivation. Protein kinase A also phosphorylates proteins that bind to the regulatory regions
of genes on DNA.
