A group of investigators is studying the regulation of catecholamine synthesis in response to
severe stress. In the experiments, subject rats are randomly assigned to either an
experimental or a control group. The experimental rats undergo resection of the pituitary
gland, and the control rats undergo craniotomy without pituitary resection. The experimental
animals are subsequently found to have decreased production of epinephrine by the adrenal
medulla and cortisol from the adrenal cortex compared with the control animals. Decreased
activity of which of the following enzymes is most likely responsible for the lower epinephrine in
the experimental animals?

. Catechol-O-methyl transferase (13%)
. Dopa decarboxylase (11%)

. Monoamine oxidase (4%)

A
B
C. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (16%)
D
E. Phenylalanine hydroxylase (3%)

F.

SY . Phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (41%)

G. Tyrosine hydroxylase (10%) Activate Windows
