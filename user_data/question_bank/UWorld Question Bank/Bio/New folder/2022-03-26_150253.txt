Leptin is a protein hormone that plays an important role in regulating appetite and metabolism.
It is produced primarily in adipocytes, and large fat cells produce more leptin than small ones.
Serum leptin concentrations are highly correlated with body fat content.

Leptin decreases food intake in the following important ways:

1. Leptin decreases the production of neuropeptide Y, a potent appetite stimulant, in the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.

2. Leptin stimulates the production of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus.
Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) is produced by cleavage of POMC
and inhibits food intake.

The knockout mouse described is homozygous for a mutation in the gene encoding the leptin
receptor (db/db), resulting in ineffective leptin signaling. As a result, these mice become
hyperphagic and profoundly obese. As leptin production is normal in these mice, leptin levels
are elevated due to the increased lipocyte mass. In contrast, mice that are homozygous for a
mutation resulting in impaired leptin production (ob/ob) also become hyperphagic and
profoundly obese, but their leptin levels are low (Choice A).

Human obesity resulting from mutations in the leptin receptor and the leptin gene has been
