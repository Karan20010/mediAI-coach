The secondary and tertiary structures of myoglobin ‘and the hemoglobin beta subunit are
almost identical (the a-subunits are also very similar to myoglobin). Because individual
hemoglobin subunits are structurally similar to myoglobin, their oxygen-binding behavior is also
similar. That is, if a hemoglobin molecule is dissociated, the individual subunits will have a
hyperbolic oxygen-dissociation curve (Choice A).

(Choice B) Line B is left-shifted compared to normal hemoglobin A, which could indicate a
high oxygen affinity hemoglobin (eg, fetal hemoglobin). Hemoglobin A will also undergo a left
shift in the presence of factors such as increased pH, decreased temperature, and decreased
2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

(Choice C) Line C depicts the normal oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, with the typical

sigmoidal relationship of pO, to hemoglobin O, saturation.

(Choices D and E) Lines D and E are shifted to the right, indicating a low oxygen affinity
hemoglobin. Hemoglobin A has low affinity for oxygen under conditions such as decreased
pH, increased temperature, and increased 2,3-diphosphoglycerate.

Educational objective:
The individual subunits of the hemoglobin molecule are structurally analogous to myoglobin. If

separated, the monomeric subunits will demonstrate a hyperbolic oxygen-dissociation curve fiens
