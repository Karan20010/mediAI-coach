Amatoxins are found in a variety of poisonous mushrooms (eg, Amanita phalloides, known as
death cap) and are responsible for the majority of mushroom poisoning fatalities worldwide.
Ingestion of 1 or more amatoxin-containing mushrooms is a life-threatening emergency. After
absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, amatoxins are transported to the liver via the portal
circulation where active transport by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) and
sodium taurocholate co-transporter (NTCP) concentrates the toxin within the liver cells. There,
amatoxins bind to DNA-dependent RNA polymerase type II and halt mRNA synthesis,
ultimately resulting in apoptosis. Other organ systems with rapid cellular turnover can also be
affected in amatoxin poisoning, including the gastrointestinal tract and proximal convoluted
renal tubules.

Symptoms typically start 6-24 hours after ingestion and include abdominal pain, vomiting, and
severe, cholera-like diarrhea that may contain blood and mucus. Severe poisoning can lead to
acute hepatic and renal failure. Urine testing for a-amanitin can confirm suspected amatoxin
poisoning.
