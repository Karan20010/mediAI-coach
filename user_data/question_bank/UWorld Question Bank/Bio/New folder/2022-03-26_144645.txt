This patient most likely has porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), the most common disorder of
porphyrin (eg, heme) synthesis. Enzyme deficiencies in the early steps in porphyrin synthesis
cause abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric manifestations (due to metabolite buildup) without
photosensitivity. Late step (ie, following porphobilinogen [PBG] conversion) derangements
(eg, PCT) cause photosensitivity, which is thought to be due to the accumulation of
porphyrinogens that react with oxygen on excitation by ultraviolet (sun) light.

PCT is caused by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) deficiency, which is either
inherited or (more commonly) acquired, manifesting in the presence of iron and of
susceptibility factors (eg, alcohol [as in this patient], smoking, halogenated hydrocarbons,
hepatitis C, HIV). Photosensitivity presents as vesicle and blister formation on sun-exposed
areas as well as edema, pruritus, pain, and erythema. Deficiencies in coproporphyrinogen
oxidase, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, or ferrochelatase can also result in photosensitivity.
