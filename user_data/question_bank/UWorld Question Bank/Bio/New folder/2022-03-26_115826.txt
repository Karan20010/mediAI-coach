agitated and confused. During transport to the hospital, he is started on intravenous fluids with
dextrose. On arrival, the patient is disoriented but cooperative. Physical examination shows
bruises on the forehead, forearms, and shins. Extraocular findings include bilateral horizontal
nystagmus and impaired lateral eye movements; however, the ambulance personnel state that
the patient's extraocular movements were normal when they arrived on the scene. The patient
also has an unsteady gait with widely spaced legs and short steps. Review of the medical
record shows that he has been admitted to the hospital with alcohol intoxication several times
before. This patient's neurologic findings are most likely related to deficiency of a cofactor
