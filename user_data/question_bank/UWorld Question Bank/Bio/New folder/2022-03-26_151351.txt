Non-glucose monosaccharides (eg, galactose, mannose, fructose) enter the glycolytic

pathway at different points as intermediates of glycolysis. Of these, fructose is the only
one whose metabolites bypass phosphofructokinase, one of the key enzymes involved in
regulating the rate of glycolysis. As a result, fructose is metabolized by the liver faster than the
other monosaccharides and is rapidly cleared from the bloodstream following dietary

absorption.

Metabolism of fructose in the liver begins with phosphorylation by fructokinase to fructose-1-
phosphate (F1P). Aldolase B can use both fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and F1P as substrates;
it converts F1P into dihydroxy acetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde.
Glyceraldehyde can be either phosphorylated to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate by triokinase or
converted to DHAP. DHAP is converted by triose phosphate isomerase to glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate, which continues down the glycolytic pathway.

(Choices B, C, D, and E) Galactose-1-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-
phosphate, and mannose-6-phosphate enter glycolysis upstream of phosphofructokinase, a
major rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis. This slows down the rate of their metabolism relative
to fructose and its metabolites (eg, F1P).
