(Choice A) 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) concentrations increase in erythrocytes when
oxygen availability is reduced, as occurs in chronic lung disease, heart failure, and chronic
exposure to high altitudes. Elevated levels of 2,3-BPG decrease hemoglobin O, affinity (right-

shifted curve), allowing release of additional O, in the peripheral tissues.

(Choices C and D) Anemia severe enough to cause lactic acidosis will result in lower blood
pH, shifting the hemoglobin curve to the right. Similarly, hypoventilation causes increased CO,
retention and respiratory acidosis that shifts the curve to the right.

(Choice E) Strenuous exercise will cause increased tissue oxidative phosphorylation,
increased tissue CO, levels, and decreased tissue pH. This results in a shift of the dissociation

curve to the right and decreased hemoglobin O, affinity.

Educational objective:

A left shift of the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve indicates increased hemoglobin O,
affinity and can be caused by increased pH, decreased 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate, and
decreased temperature. Leftward shifts of the curve inhibit the release of O, within peripheral

tissues.
