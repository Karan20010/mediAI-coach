Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the lack of homogentisic acid
dioxygenase blocks the metabolism of tyrosine, leading to an accumulation of homogentisic
acid. Clinical features include a black urine color when exposed to air, a blue-black
pigmentation on the face, and ochronotic arthropathy.
