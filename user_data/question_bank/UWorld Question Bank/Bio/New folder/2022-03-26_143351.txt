Researchers studying chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) observe that in some patients the
disease is indolent, with limited growth over more than a decade, whereas in other patients the
disease is more aggressive and becomes symptomatic early on. They find that genetic
abnormalities can be detected in a majority of patients with CLL and may play a role in
determining the difference between the 2 disease courses. A clinical study is conducted with

the hypothesis that individuals with CLL with trisomy of chromosome 12 have a more favorable
course than individuals with other genetic changes. Which of the following laboratory
techniques would be most useful for identifying patients with this genetic abnormality?

© A. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
©, B. Flow cytometry

©) C. Fluorescence in situ hybridization

©) D. Northern blotting

©) E. Western blotting
