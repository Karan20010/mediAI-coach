oncogenes following a mutation or with constitutive expression.

(Choice A) Ras is a proto-oncogene that codes for a membrane-bound G-protein. This G-
protein acts as a secondary mediator for several hormones and cytokines that act on cell
membrane receptors. Ras activation activates the MAP kinase pathway and ultimately affects
transcription. However, Ras itself does not bind directly to DNA.

(Choices C and E) The 81-adrenergic receptor is a classic Gs-protein-coupled receptor
located in the cell membrane. It does not interact directly with DNA. Adenylyl cyclase is the
enzyme that cleaves ATP to form cAMP, the second messenger associated with G,-protein-
coupled receptors. cAMP activates protein kinase A for further downstream signaling.

(Choice D) S-100 proteins are homodimeric calcium-binding proteins, similar in structure to
calmodulin and important in intracellular functions such as protein phosphorylation and cell
growth and differentiation. S-100 is a marker for cells of neural crest derivation (melanocytes
and Schwann cells), as well as Langerhans cells and other dendritic cells.

Educational objective:
Southwestern blotting is used to detect DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors,
nucleases, and histones.
