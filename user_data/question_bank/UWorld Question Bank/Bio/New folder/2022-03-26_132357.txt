amino acids, account for the rubber-like properties of elastin.

(Choices A and B) Disulfide bridges are formed during collagen, not elastin, synthesis. After
post-translational hydroxylation and glycosylation of procollagen molecules, disulfide bond
formation between the C-terminal propeptide regions of 3 alpha chains brings the chains into a
favorable alignment for triple helix assembly.

Educational objective:

The rubber-like properties of elastin are due to high content of nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino
acids and extensive cross-linking between elastin monomers facilitated by lysyl oxidase.
Patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can develop early-onset, lower lobe—predominant
emphysema due to excessive alveolar elastin degradation.
