(Choice A) Eukaryotic chromatin is composed of repeated subunits called nucleosomes,
which consist of double-stranded DNA wrapped around histone protein cores. Nucleosomes
are important for the compact packaging of DNA into chromosomes with the aid of other
packaging proteins.

(Choice B) Peroxisomes are cytoplasmic organelles containing oxidative enzymes (eg,
catalase, D-amino acid oxidase, uric acid oxidase). These organelles are ubiquitous among
eukaryotes and are most abundant in the liver and kidneys, where detoxification of ingested
and environmental materials occurs. In the liver, peroxisomes also play a role in the
breakdown of fatty acids.

(Choice C) Proteasomes and lysosomes are responsible for protein/polypeptide degradation.
Proteasomes mainly degrade intracellular proteins, whereas lysosomes degrade extracellular
proteins and worn-out organelles.

(Choice D) Ribosomes are present in the cytoplasm and are required for translation of MRNA

into protein. Individual ribosomes are comprised of rRNA and ribosomal proteins. Within the

cell, rRNA engages mRNA and facilitates tRNA entry during the formation of polypeptide

chains. Activate Windows
