(Choice A) Glutamine is converted to alpha-ketoglutarate, a component of the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle; it is used as an alternative to glucose to generate NADH. Tumor cells often
increase (not decrease) glutamine absorption/conversion to increase NADH generation.

(Choice B) One-carbon donor molecules (eg, serine, glycine, methionine) are used to
generate nucleotides, phospholipids, and reduction factors as part of the folate and methionine
pathways. The production/use of one-carbon donor molecules is generally increased (not
decreased) in rapidly dividing cells to provide adequate substrates for cellular proliferation.

(Choice C) Tumors require large amounts of fatty acids as part of cell growth and replication;
therefore, enzymes that generate fatty acids (eg, acetyl-CoA carboxylase) are typically
upregulated (not downregulated).
