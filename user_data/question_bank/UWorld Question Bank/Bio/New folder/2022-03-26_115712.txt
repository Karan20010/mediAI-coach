Question Id: 1010

A 24-year-old postpartum woman comes to the office for follow-up of gestational diabetes.

weeks gestation; she was treated with dietary modification and exercise and required insulin
briefly. Since delivery 12 weeks ago, she has continued to follow dietary recommendations,
and her blood glucose has been fairly well controlled without insulin. The patient has fasting
blood glucose levels of 100-120 mg/dL. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Family
history is significant for diabetes mellitus in her mother and gestational diabetes in her sister.
Vital signs are within normal limits. BMI is 22 kg/m2. Physical examination shows no

genetically predisposed. This patient's condition is most likely caused by reduced activity of
