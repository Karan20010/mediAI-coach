This patient has features of anemia (eg, exertional dyspnea, fatigue, pallor) with associated
neurologic deficits that are highly suggestive of vitamin B,, deficiency. The hematologic
manifestations of B,, deficiency (eg, megaloblastic anemia, pancytopenia) are related to

impaired DNA synthesis.

Vitamin B,, (nydroxocobalamin) also serves as a cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
(converts methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA) and methionine synthase (converts
homocysteine and folic acid to methionine). B,. deficiency consequently results in elevated
levels of serum methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. Increased methylmalonic acid
levels can disrupt myelin synthesis and result in subacute combined degeneration of the
dorsal columns (eg, loss of proprioception/vibration, Romberg sign) and lateral corticospinal
tract (eg, spastic muscle weakness, hyperreflexia). Axonal degeneration of peripheral nerves
can also be seen.
