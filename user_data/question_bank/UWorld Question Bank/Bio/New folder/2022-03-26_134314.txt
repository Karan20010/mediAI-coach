a (Choice A) Janus kinase (JAK) is a component of the second messenger system for various

= peptide hormones (eg, growth hormone, prolactin) and cytokines (eg, interferon, interleukin).

as JAK has tyrosine kinase activity; however, it is a cytoplasmic enzyme that is not part of a cell

: surface receptor (non-receptor tyrosine kinase).

(Choice B) Lipoxygenase is an enzyme involved in arachidonic acid metabolism and is

o 2) responsible for the arm of that pathway that synthesizes leukotrienes.
2 2 (Choice C) Phospholipase C is activated in the G-protein/inositol triphosphate (IP;)/calcium
: = second messenger system. Hormone-receptor binding activates a G-protein that in turn
2s activates phospholipase C to degrade phospholipids into IP, and diacylglycerol. Both
> diacylglycerol and the increased intracellular calcium caused by IP; lead to protein kinase C
= activation.

: (Choice D) Protein kinase A is the primary intracellular effector enzyme in the G-

+ 32 protein/adenylate cyclase second messenger system. Glucagon acts through this pathway to
stimulate glycogen breakdown. Protein kinase A activates glycogen phosphorylase via

35 activation of glycogen phosphorylase kinase.
