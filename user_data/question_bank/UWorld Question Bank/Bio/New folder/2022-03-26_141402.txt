(Choice A) The partial pressure of oxygen (pO.) is a measure of dissolved oxygen in the

plasma, the amount of which does not change in CO poisoning.

(Choice C) NADH methemoglobin reductase reduces ferric iron (Fe:-) to ferrous iron (Fe),
regenerating hemoglobin from methemoglobin. Enzyme deficiency results in congenital
methemoglobinemia.

(Choice D) Globin chain denaturation occurs in G6PD-deficient red blood cells when oxidant

stressors cause sulfhydryl group cross-linking.
(Choice E) CO reversibly binds hemoglobin at its heme moieties.

(Choice F) Heme consists of an iron bound to protoporphyrin IX. CO binds to iron in
metalloproteins but does not cause oxidation of the porphyrin component.

Educational objective:

Carbon monoxide binds heme iron in hemoglobin with an affinity much greater than oxygen,
generating carboxyhemoglobin. Remaining binding sites on carboxyhemoglobin have an
increased affinity for oxygen that causes the oxygen dissociation curve to shift to the left,
impeding oxygen delivery to tissues.
