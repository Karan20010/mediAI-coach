Glucose-induced insulin release from pancreatic beta cells requires the following steps:

. Glucose enters the beta cell through glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT-2).

. Glucose is metabolized by glucokinase to glucose-6-phosphate.

. Glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis to produce ATP.

. Increased ATP levels causes closure of ATP-sensitive potassium (Kz) channels.

. Depolarization of beta cells triggers opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels.
6. Influx of calcium causes insulin release.

Glucokinase has a lower glucose affinity than other hexokinases, which allows it to limit the
rate of glucose entry into the glycolytic pathway based on blood glucose levels. It therefore
functions as a glucose sensor for beta cells in controlling insulin release.

Heterozygous mutations of the glucokinase gene that decrease the activity or affinity of the
enzyme cause a decrease in beta cell glucose metabolism, leading to reduced ATP formation
and insulin secretion at any given glucose level. Glucokinase mutations are one cause of
maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), an autosomal dominant disorder
characterized by mild hyperglycemia that often worsens with pregnancy-induced insulin
resistance. In contrast to those with more common type 2 diabetes mellitus, patients with
MODY are typically younger and nonobese, and the condition is nonprogressive, even
