(Choice A) Restriction sites are cleaved by specific endonucleases and can be used to
identify polymorphisms within variant alleles on gel electrophoresis (restriction fragment length
polymorphism analysis). However, knowing the restriction enzyme susceptibility sites within
the target region is not necessary for PCR amplification.

(Choice B) In PCR, only DNAsegments are amplified and studied; proteins are not involved.
Proteins can be analyzed using Western blots, but even then, exact amino acid sequences do
not need to be known.

(Choice C) Complementary DNA (cDNA) is produced by the reverse transcriptase enzyme
using mRNA as a template in reverse transcriptase PCR; it is not used in regular PCR. cDNA
can be used to express eukaryotic proteins in prokaryotes by transferring the cDNA into the
genome of a recipient organism.

Educational objective:

Polymerase chain reaction is used to amplify small fragments of DNA (eg, genes, exons,
noncoding regions) by repeated replication. It requires primers that are complementary to the
regions of DNA flanking the segment of interest. Thermostable DNA polymerase,
deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and a source DNA template strand are also necessary.
