Folate derivatives are crucial in the synthesis of nucleic acids (particularly thymine),
conversion of homocysteine to methionine, and generation of one-carbon carriers (eg, S-
adenosylmethionine) for methylation reactions. All biochemical functions of folate require the
reduced tetrahydrofolate form of the vitamin, which is synthesized by dihydrofolate reductase
(a rate-limiting step in folate metabolism).

The enzyme thymidylate synthase is responsible for converting deoxyuridine
monophosphate (dUMP) to deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). Although most enzymes
involved in one-carbon metabolism maintain folate in its active tetrahydrofolate form,
thymidylate synthase is unique in that it oxidizes 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
dihydrofolate. This makes de novo thymidine synthesis particularly susceptible to folate-
deficient conditions because tetrahydrofolate must be continuously regenerated by
dihydrofolate reductase.

In this experiment, inhibition of thymidylate synthase due to deficient folate increases the
ratio of (UMP to dTMP, causing the incorporation of uracil into DNA in place of thymidine.
This leads to excessive activation of DNA repair mechanisms, resulting in double-stranded
DNA breaks and apoptosis. Thymidine supplementation reduces the metabolic folate
demand, preventing apoptosis in folate-deficient cells.
