(Choice E) Patients with hemoglobin SC disease have 1 beta globulin with the sickle mutation
and 1 beta globulin with a mutation that substitutes lysine for glutamate at position 6. They
produce two predominant hemoglobins: HbS and Hemoglobin C, the latter of which is not seen
in sickle cell anemia as there is no hemoglobin C mutation.

Educational objective:

Homozygous sickle cell disease is marked by a point mutation in both beta globulin genes.
This leads to the generation of a new predominant hemoglobin called hemoglobin S (HbS),
which polymerizes when deoxygenated. Because hemoglobin F (HbF) prevents HbS
polymerization, hydroxyurea is often administered to increase HbF levels and reduce
complications of the disease.
