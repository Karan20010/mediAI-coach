shifting of free water into the ICF compartment, causing ICF expansion.

(Choice D) Infusion of large amounts of hypertonic saline leads to hypertonic volume
expansion. Both the volume and osmolarity of the ECF are increased. The high osmolarity of
the ECF leads to shifting of water from the ICF, further increasing the ECF volume.

(Choice E) Primary polydipsia (excessive water consumption) and SIADH (inappropriately
high vasopressin levels) both cause retention of free water in the body. This leads to
expansion of the ICF compartment and a decrease in the osmolarity of both compartments
(hyposmotic volume expansion). Expansion of the ECF compartment is limited in these
conditions due to compensatory secretion of aldosterone and natriuretic peptides, which help
to normalize the extracellular fluid volume. Thus, affected patients are clinically euvolemic.

Educational objective:

Volume contraction and expansion can be divided into isosmotic, hyposmotic, and
hyperosmotic states. Hyperosmotic volume contraction is caused by a loss of free water (with
retention of electrolytes). It can occur in patients with diabetes insipidus or as a result of
decreased fluid intake/excessive sweating.
