This patient most likely has heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, an autosomal
dominant LDL receptor defect that causes high LDL levels and increases the risk of
premature atherosclerosis. Homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (a rarer and more
severe form of the disease due to inheritance of 2 defective LDL receptor alleles) often
presents with coronary heart disease in childhood/adolescence.

Southern blotting is a technique that can be used to detect DNA mutations. The process
involves the following steps:

1. DNA extraction from the individual's cells
2. Restriction endonuclease digestion of the DNA sample into fragments

Loy)

. Gel electrophoresis to separate the various sizes of DNA fragments; larger fragments
move slowly and shorter fragments move faster

4. DNA probe (a single-stranded segment of labeled DNA complementary to the gene of

interest) to identify the target gene

Once the gene of interest is identified by the DNA probe, various family members' Southern

blots can be compared. Because both the patient and his father are affected, the common

DNA segment between them (8 kb segment) most likely represents the mutated gene. The
patient's son also has the 8 kb segment, meaning that he is probably affected as well.
