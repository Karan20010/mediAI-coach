A 22-year-old woman comes to the hospital due to a 5-day history of nausea, constipation, and
severe, poorly localized abdominal pain. She also reports anxiety, difficulty concentrating,
poor sleep quality, and tingling of the limbs. The patient has had several similar episodes in
the past. She does not take any medications or use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs. The
patient has been restricting her diet to lose weight. On examination, the abdomen is soft,

nontender, and nondistended. Bowel sounds are decreased. The patient receives an
intravenous infusion of a heme preparation that leads to rapid resolution of her symptoms.
The improvement in symptoms is most likely due to treatment-induced downregulation of

which of the following enzymes?

A. Aminolevulinate dehydratase (9%)
B. Aminolevulinate synthase (52%)

C. Bilirubin glucuronyl transferase (4%)
D. Ferrochelatase (12%)
