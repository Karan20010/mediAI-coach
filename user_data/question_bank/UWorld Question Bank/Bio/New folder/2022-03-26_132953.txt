(Choices A, B, and C) Glucose uptake by hepatocytes, pancreatic beta cells, neurons, and
15 enterocytes primarily involves insulin-independent glucose transporters and does not
substantially change with insulin concentration.

(Choice E) Both skeletal myocytes and adipocytes express GLUT-4 and would show

20 increased glucose uptake in response to insulin.

BD Educational objective:

23 Glucose transport protein (GLUT)-4 is an insulin-sensitive glucose transporter expressed in
24

25 skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes that translocates to the plasma membrane in response to
26 increasing insulin levels. In contrast, GLUT-1, 2, 3, and 5 are always present on the plasma
27

28 membrane and constitutively transport glucose in an insulin-independent manner.
