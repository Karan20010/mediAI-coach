patient's son also has the 8 kb segment, meaning that he is probably affected as well.

(Choice A) Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder. X-linked
recessive mutations are transmitted from unaffected carrier mothers to their sons. Father-to-
son transmission does not occur.

(Choices B and D) The patient (affected by the disease) does not possess the 10 kb
segment, so this segment does not correspond to the mutated gene. The patient's brother
inherited the 10 kb segment from his father (not the 8kb mutated segment), so he would not be
affected.

(Choice C) The patient and his brother, but not their father, have a 12 kb segment on
Southern blot analysis. Therefore, this segment was likely inherited from the mother and does
not carry the mutation.

Educational objective:

Southern blotting is a technique used to identify DNA mutations. It involves restriction
endonuclease digestion of sample DNA, gel electrophoresis, and gene identification with a
labeled DNA probe.
