This infant with delayed motor development and flaccid paralysis (eg, hypotonia, decreased
deep tendon reflexes) likely has spinal muscular atrophy. This condition is caused by
mutations in the survival motor neuron (SMN71) gene, which encodes a protein involved in
assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (SnRNPs) in lower motor neurons. Defective
snRNP assembly results in impaired spliceosome function and degeneration of anterior horn
cells in the spinal cord.

RNA molecules that carry out functions without first being translated into proteins are called
non-coding RNAs. These include small nuclear RNA (snRNA), ribosomal RNA (rRNA), and
transfer RNA (tRNA). snRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and associates with specific
proteins to form snRNPs. A collection of snRNPs and other proteins on pre-mRNA is referred
to as aspliceosome. Spliceosomes remove introns from pre-mRNA by cleaving the 5' end
of intron 1 (splice donor site) and joining that end to the branch point. The freed 3'-OH of exon
1 then forms a phosphodiester bond with the 5'-phosphate at the splice acceptor site, joining
exons 1 and 2.
