(Choice A) cGMP activates protein kinase G, which mediates a number of intracellular effects
(eg, smooth muscle relaxation, platelet activation, sperm metabolism). cGMP is inactivated by
cGMP phosphodiesterase, which cleaves cGMP in the corpus cavernosum of the penis and
regulates penile erection. Drugs that inhibit cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase (eg, sildenafil)
are used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.

(Choice B) Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) is a cytoplasmic protein activated by ligand binding to
non-G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors that lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.
Growth hormone, erythropoietin, and cytokines (eg, interferon) are common ligands for these
receptors. JAKs activate cytoplasmic transcription factors called STATs (signal transducers
and activators of transcription), which enter the nucleus to promote gene transcription.

(Choice C) cAMP is cleaved by the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase to its inactive form, 5'-
AMP. Drugs that inhibit CAMP phosphodiesterase lead to prolongation of the actions of cAMP.
An example is the use of theophylline in bronchial asthma.

(Choice E) Ligands such as insulin and epidermal growth factor act through transmembrane
receptors that have intrinsic tyrosine kinase domains.
