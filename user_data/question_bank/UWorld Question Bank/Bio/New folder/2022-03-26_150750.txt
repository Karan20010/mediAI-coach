This patient most likely has deficiency of vitamin B,, (cobalamin), a water-soluble vitamin
obtained solely from the diet, specifically animal products such as meat, dairy, and fish.
Vitamin B,, cannot be obtained directly from plant products, placing strict vegans at risk for
dietary deficiency, particularly those who do not eat vitamin B,,—fortified foods; without
supplementation, patients with impaired intrinsic factor production (eg, pernicious anemia, total

gastrectomy) also inevitably develop deficiency.

The liver can store approximately 1,000 times the daily vitamin B,, requirement; deficiency
develops only after the complete absence of intake or absorption for 3-4 years, making a
long-standing (ie, 6 years) vegan diet consistent with this patient's presentation, in contrast to
a recent (ie, 8 months) gastrectomy (Choice C).

Development of anemia and severe, potentially irreversible neurologic damage can result from
vitamin B,. deficiency. Red blood cell synthesis relies on vitamin B,.-dependent recycling of
folate; deficiency of either vitamin results in megaloblastic anemia. Impaired myelin synthesis,
specifically in the dorsal and lateral columns, results in subacute combined degeneration of
the spinal cord. This condition is progressive and begins as a symmetric neuropathy
consisting of paresthesia and weakness. Ongoing deficiency leads to loss of vibration and
position sensation with development of an ataxic gait. The longer the deficiency is untreated,
