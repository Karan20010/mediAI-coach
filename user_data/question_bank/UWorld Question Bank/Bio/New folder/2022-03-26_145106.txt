Bacterial DNA replication is coordinated by the actions of multiple enzymes and proteins.
Before DNA synthesis begins, helicase binds double-stranded DNA at the origin of replication
with the assistance of DnaA protein, forming a replication fork that unwinds and separates the
DNA (Choice D). Single-stranded DNA-binding protein then attaches to the separated strands
to prevent their reannealing. Unwinding and separation of DNA produces positive supercoils
that can lead to DNA fracture if not relieved. Topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) relieves the
tension created during unwinding by introducing negative supercoils into the DNA (Choice C).

Before DNA polymerase III can begin elongating a new DNA strand, it requires an RNA primer
made up of short RNA sequences base-paired to the parent DNA. This primer is synthesized
by the enzyme primase (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) (Choice F). DNA synthesis then
proceeds in the 5' to 3' direction with the leading strand being formed continuously toward the
replication fork and the lagging strand being formed discontinuously away from the replication
fork. Replication of the lagging strand results in the formation of numerous short DNA
segments called Okazaki fragments. These fragments are ultimately bound together by the
enzyme ligase after their RNA primers have been removed and replaced with DNA (Choice E).
