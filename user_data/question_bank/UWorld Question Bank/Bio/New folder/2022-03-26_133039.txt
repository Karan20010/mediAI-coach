Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine metabolism. Deficiency of
homogentisic acid dioxygenase blocks homogentisic acid metabolism, preventing the
conversion of tyrosine to fumarate. Homogentisic acid accumulates in the body and is
excreted in the urine, imparting a black color to the urine if allowed to sit and undergo
oxidation. In patients with alkaptonuria, the retained homogentisic acid selectively binds to
collagen in connective tissues, tendons, and cartilage. This leads to "ochronosis," a blue-
black pigmentation most evident in the ears, nose, and cheeks, and ochronotic arthropathy,
which typically manifests during adulthood.
