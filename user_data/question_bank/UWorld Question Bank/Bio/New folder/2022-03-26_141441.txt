Thalassemias are hereditary hemolytic anemias resulting from defective synthesis of globin
chains. As described above, the synthesis of alpha and beta globin chains is very
coordinated. In patients with thalassemia, the synthesis of either alpha or beta chains is
defective. Beta thalassemia is caused by defective synthesis of beta chains. There are two
copies of the beta globin gene (one from each parent). If only one gene is defective the
patient will have beta thalassemia trait (beta thalassemia minor) and lack significant anemia. A
defect in both beta globin genes results in severe hemolytic anemia known as beta
thalassemia major. In this disease, alpha chains are produced normally but they cannot form
stable tetramers due to the lack of beta globin chains. This failure to form stable hemoglobin
leads to precipitation of alpha globin chains and premature lysis of red blood cells. Beta
thalassemia cannot become symptomatic as long as there are significant amounts of gamma
chains present because gamma chains make up for the absence of HbA beta chains in
forming tetramers. Thus, in late gestation and early postnatal life, the expression of
hemoglobin A is offset by gamma chain production (Choice C). As gamma chain production
wanes, patients will become symptomatic.
