Calcium plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac, smooth, and
skeletal muscle cells. Myocyte depolarization causes activation of L-type calcium channels on
the plasma membrane. In cardiac and smooth muscle cells, this leads to an influx of
extracellular calcium that activates sarcoplasmic RyR channels, inducing the release of
additional calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (calcium-induced calcium release). The
released calcium binds to troponin (cardiac muscle) or calmodulin (smooth muscle), allowing
actin and myosin to interact and cause muscle contraction.

In contrast, the L-type calcium channels in skeletal muscle directly interact with RyR calcium
channels to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This mechanical coupling
between the receptors allows sarcoplasmic calcium release to occur without significant influx
of calcium across the plasma membrane. Verapamil is a nondihydropyridine calcium channel
blocker that acts by blocking L-type calcium channels, preventing the initial calcium influx
into cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells. Because skeletal muscle is not
dependent on extracellular calcium influx, calcium channel blockers do not affect skeletal
muscle contractility.
