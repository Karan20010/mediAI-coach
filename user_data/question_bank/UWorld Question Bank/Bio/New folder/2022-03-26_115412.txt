The transition from point 1 to 2 on the graph represents the loading of O, onto partially
deoxygenated hemoglobin as occurs in the lungs. At very low partial pressure of O, (pO.),
hemoglobin is mostly deoxygenated, and binding of O, molecules is relatively difficult (as
indicated by the early flatness of the curve). As the partial pressure of O, increases, O, binds
to 1 of the 4 binding sites on hemoglobin and increases the O,-binding affinity of the other
available binding sites (steepening of the curve), a phenomenon known as cooperative
binding. Subsequently, additional O, molecules bind more easily as the pO, increases until

hemoglobin becomes nearly fully saturated.
The binding of O, molecules to hemoglobin in the lungs has two consequences, known as the
Haldane effect:
¢ The affinity of hemoglobin for CO, is decreased, resulting in unloading of CO, from
hemoglobin (this accounts for a small percentage of overall CO, in the blood and is not
pictured above).

¢ The acidity of the hemoglobin molecule is increased; in response, protons (H: ions) are

released from the hemoglobin binding sites.
