Educational objective:

The buildup of very long chain and branched-chain (eg, phytanic) fatty acids due to impaired
oxidation is the hallmark of peroxisomal disorders (eg, Zellweger syndrome,
adrenoleukodystrophy). Accumulation of these fatty acids in the brain results in permanent

neurologic dysfunction.
