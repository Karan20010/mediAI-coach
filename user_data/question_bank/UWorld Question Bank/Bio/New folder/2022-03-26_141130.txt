Hemoglobin C (HbC) disease is due to a single amino acid substitution (glutamic acid
lysine) at position 6 in the beta globin chain of the hemoglobin molecule. Hemoglobin S (HbS)
is similar to HbC in that it is also formed by an amino acid substitution at position 6 in the beta
globin chain. However, patients homozygous for HbC have mild chronic hemolytic anemia,
whereas those homozygous for HbS generally have a more severe anemia complicated by

vasoocclusive pain episodes. Which of the following properties best accounts for the differing

clinical severity between the two conditions?

©) A. HbS allows hydrophobic interaction among hemoglobin molecules

©) B. HbS decreases beta globin interaction with 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate
(©) C. HbS impairs oxygen unloading from the heme moiety

©) D. HbS prevents proper folding of the alpha helix in the beta globin chain
©) E. HbS stabilizes the iron moiety in the ferric (Fe) state
