Methylmalonic acidemia is an organic acidemia due to complete or partial deficiency of
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Complete deficiency classically presents with lethargy, vomiting,
and tachypnea in a newborn. Laboratory testing shows hyperammonemia, ketotic
hypoglycemia, and metabolic acidosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by elevated urine
methylmalonic acid and propionic acid.
