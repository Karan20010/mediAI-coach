This patient has signs of benign intracranial hypertension (ie, headache, vomiting, papilledema
with a negative head CT scan) as well as dry skin and hepatomegaly. This constellation of
findings in a patient with eccentric dietary habits makes vitamin A toxicity the most likely
diagnosis.

Individuals prone to developing hypervitaminosis A typically consume >10 times the
recommended daily allowance of vitamin A, particularly via ingestion of animal products (eg,
eggs, kidney, liver) that contain preformed vitamin A; retinoid-containing medications are
also a risk factor for hypervitaminosis A. Other dietary sources (eg, green leafy vegetables,
carrots) are unlikely to cause toxicity because they contain provitamin A, the metabolism of
which is highly regulated.
