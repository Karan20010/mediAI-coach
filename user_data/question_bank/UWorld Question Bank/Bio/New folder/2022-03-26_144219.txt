dihydroxyvitamin D levels.

(Choice A) Catabolism of vitamin D is initiated by CYP24A11 (ie, 24-hydroxylase), which
inactivates both the 25- and 1,25-hydroxylated vitamin D forms. Expression of this enzyme is
induced by carbamazepine and other anticonvulsants (eg, phenytoin), increasing the risk of
vitamin D deficiency.

(Choice B) Patients with vitamin D—deficiency rickets, the more common type, have clinical
features resembling HVDRR, including hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. However, 25-
hydroxyvitamin D is low, reflecting reduced whole-body stores (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D may
sometimes be normal due to upregulation of PTH).

(Choice D) Primary hyperparathyroidism presents with mild or moderate hypercalcemia.

Serum phosphorus is low due to renal phosphate wasting, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is
elevated due to increased activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase. 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are
generally unaffected.

(Choice E) Granulomatous diseases (eg, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis) can be associated with
extrarenal expression of 1-alpha-hydroxylase by macrophages. This leads to increased
production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Total vitamin

D stores (25-hydroxyvitamin D) are generally normal.
