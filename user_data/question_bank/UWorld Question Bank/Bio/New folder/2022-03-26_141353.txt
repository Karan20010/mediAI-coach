This patient most likely has carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, a condition that presents with
nonspecific findings ranging from headache and dizziness to convulsions and respiratory
arrest depending on concentration and exposure. CO is a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas
that is a byproduct of incomplete hydrocarbon combustion. CO poisoning is most often
caused by smoke inhalation from a fire or the burning of fuel sources such as wood, coal, or
natural gas in poorly ventilated environments.

CO toxicity occurs because of CO's ability to competitively bind iron present in heme proteins.
The gas binds to heme iron with a much higher affinity than oxygen, forming
carboxyhemoglobin. Even if only 1 of the 4 heme sites is affected, the remaining 3 heme
groups have increased oxygen affinity (leftward shift of the oxygen dissociation curve),
impeding oxygen delivery to tissues. CO is also capable of binding cardiac myoglobin with
high affinity, disrupting the heart's ability to use oxygen and thereby decreasing cardiac
output. At a cellular level, CO binds to cytochrome oxidase, inhibiting aerobic metabolism and
exacerbating tissue hypoxia.

Treatment for CO poisoning is administration of high-flow or hyperbaric oxygen therapy as
this hastens the dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin.
