Gallstones can be categorized as cholesterol, pigment, or mixed stones. Cholesterol stones
are formed when the ability of bile salts to solubilize cholesterol is overwhelmed by high
concentrations of cholesterol in bile. Cholesterol stones are yellow to pale gray and hard. By
contrast, pigment gallstones are composed of calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin, are
comparatively soft, and are dark brown to black.

Brown pigment stones typically arise secondary to bacterial (eg, Escherichia coli) or
helminthic (eg, Ascaris lumbricoides, Clonorchis sinensis) infection of the biliary tract, which
results in the release of beta-glucuronidase by injured hepatocytes and bacteria. This
enzyme hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin.
The liver fluke C sinensis is a common cause of pigmented stones in East Asian countries and
can have a prolonged quiescent phase before inducing symptoms.

Pigment stones may also occur in the absence of infection when excess bilirubin is excreted,
such as with chronic hemolytic anemia. A small amount of conjugated bilirubin normally
becomes deconjugated by endogenous beta-glucuronidase in the biliary tract. When large
amounts of conjugated bilirubin are excreted into the bile, enough becomes deconjugated to
promote black pigment stone formation.
