Hemeproteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin contain heme groups that are used to
reversibly bind oxygen for transportation and storage. Hemoglobin A (the major form of
hemoglobin in adults) is a tetramer consisting of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains. Each hemoglobin
subunit is associated with a heme moiety, so each hemoglobin molecule has 4 heme groups.
After binding to 1 oxygen molecule, the oxygen affinity of other heme molecules increases; this
heme-heme interaction is responsible for the characteristic sigmoid shape of the oxygen-
hemoglobin dissociation curve.

In contrast to hemoglobin, myoglobin is a monomeric protein and the primary oxygen-storing
protein in skeletal and cardiac muscle tissue; it is only found in the bloodstream after muscle
injury. The partial pressure of oxygen at which 50% of myoglobin molecules are oxygen
saturated (P:.) is only 1 mm Hg, which is much lower than the P;, of hemoglobin (26 mm Hg).
Myoglobin also has only a single heme group and so does not experience heme-heme
interactions; therefore, its oxygen-dissociation curve is hyperbolic.
