(Choice A) a-ketoglutarate functions as a key intermediate in the TCA cycle and as a nitrogen
transporter in metabolic reactions. In the setting of hyperammonemia, ammonia is detoxified
to glutamate via glutamate dehydrogenase, depleting a-ketoglutarate and impairing energy
metabolism in the brain.

(Choice B) Alanine is an amino group transporter in the glucose-alanine cycle in liver and
muscle tissue. This process allows tissues that use amino acids for fuel to shunt excess

nitrogen back to the liver.

(Choice C) Aspartate is a nonessential amino acid that functions as a substrate in the urea
cycle and as part of the malate-aspartate shuttle that transfers cytosolic-reducing equivalents
into the mitochondrial matrix.

(Choice D) Carbamoyl phosphate is a urea cycle intermediate synthesized by carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase I, which transfers an ammonia molecule from glutamine or glutamate to
a phosphorylated bicarbonate. Carbamoyl phosphate production is decreased in patients with
advanced liver disease.

Educational objective:
Hyperammonemia in advanced liver failure occurs as a direct result of the cirrhotic liver's
