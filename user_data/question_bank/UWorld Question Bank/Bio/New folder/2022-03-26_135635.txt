Educational objective:

Rapidly dividing cells such as stem cells and cancer cells generate energy through anaerobic
glycolysis (Warburg effect). This pathway converts the majority of glucose to lactate despite
the presence of adequate oxygen to run oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, cancer cells
generally produce far more lactate than a normal terminally differentiated cell.
