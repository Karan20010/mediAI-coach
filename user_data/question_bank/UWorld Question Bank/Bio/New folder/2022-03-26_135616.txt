Cells produce energy via 2 main pathways depending on oxygen availability, as follows:

¢ Anaerobic glycolysis occurs in oxygen-poor states. This pathway converts glucose —
pyruvate — lactate in the cytosol, which is then excreted from the cell. It nets 2 ATP.

¢ Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in oxygen-rich states. This pathway moves pyruvate
from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA and run through
the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This generates NADH, a reductive compound used to
produce ATP in the electron transport chain. Oxidative phosphorylation nets up to 36 ATP
for each glucose molecule.

Oxidative phosphorylation is the primary driver of energy metabolism in most terminally
differentiated cells during normal conditions. However, rapidly dividing cells such as stem cells
and cancer cells generate most of their energy through anaerobic glycolysis despite the
presence of adequate oxygen (Warburg effect) (Choice D). These cells produce significantly
more lactate than a normal terminally differentiated cell as almost all glucose is converted to
lactate and excreted.
