(Choices A and B) Aldose reductase also catalyzes the conversion of galactose (obtained

galactitol to its corresponding keto sugar (tagatose, a food sweetener). In galactosemia

causes cataracts in newborns.

(Choice D) In the hexose monophosphate shunt, glucose-6-phosphate is converted to 6-

13 phosphogluconolactone by the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD),

: generating the reducing equivalent NADPH. G6PD deficiency results in hemolytic anemia

18 (Choice E) Lactate dehydrogenase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate under

anaerobic conditions. Excess lactate forms in hypoxic states, causing metabolic acidosis.

at Educational objective:
° In hyperglycemic states, aldose reductase converts glucose to sorbitol at a rate faster than
7 24 sorbitol can be metabolized. Sorbitol accumulates in certain cells such as lens cells, causing
: i. an influx of water and resulting in osmotic cellular injury. Depletion of NADPH by aldose
27 reductase also increases oxidative stress, which accelerates development of cataracts and
diabetic microvascular complications (eg, neuropathy, retinopathy).
