(Choice B) Carnitine assists with long-chain fatty acid transport into mitochondria.
Deficiencies in carnitine (eg, primary systemic carnitine deficiency) lead to fatty acid oxidation
defects in cardiac and skeletal muscle.

(Choice D) Thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency can cause dry and wet beriberi and Wernicke-
Korsakoff syndrome.

(Choice E) Tyrosine is a nonessential amino acid and the precursor for catecholamines such
as dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.

(Choice F) Vitamin K is involved in the post-translational conversion of glutamate to gamma-
carboxyglutamic acid. This modification is necessary for the function of many clotting factors
and regulatory proteins involved in the coagulation cascade.

Educational objective:

Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by cystathionine synthase deficiency. Affected
individuals have marfanoid habitus, ectopia lentis, and developmental delay. Significant
morbidity and mortality are due primarily to thromboembolism. Many patients with
homocystinuria respond dramatically to pyridoxine (vitamin B6) supplementation.
