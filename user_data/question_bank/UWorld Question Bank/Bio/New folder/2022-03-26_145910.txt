In an animal experiment, murine proerythroblasts are cultured in 2 different growth media; the

first medium is folate deficient, whereas the second (control) is supplemented with additional

folic acid. Both media contain high concentrations of erythropoietin. Over 48 hours, cells in

the control media proliferate and differentiate into reticulocytes, whereas in the folate-deficient

media, cell proliferation is minimal, with the majority of cells undergoing apoptosis. In another

experiment, a substance is added to the folate-deficient media; this substance prevents

apoptosis and permits proliferation of some of the proerythroblasts. Which of the following is

the most likely substance added to the growth medium?

VY E. Thymidine (31%)

A. Cobalamin (40%)
B. Cytosine (2%)
C. Glutamine (3%)

D. Homocysteine (21%)
