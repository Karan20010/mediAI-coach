Educational objective:

Chronic thiamine (vitamin B,) deficiency impairs glucose use, particularly in mammillary
bodies, as seen in Wernicke encephalopathy. This occurs due to decreased activity of the
enzymes that use thiamine as a cofactor (eg, transketolase). Low erythrocyte transketolase
activity that increases after the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate is diagnostic.
