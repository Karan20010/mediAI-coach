This patient with bone pain and deformity (eg, frontal bossing, lower extremity bowing,
abnormal mineralization of metaphyseal bone) has rickets. Dermal abnormalities (eg,
alopecia) also are common due to keratinocyte dysfunction. The most common cause of
rickets is vitamin D deficiency, but less common causes include hereditary vitamin D-
resistant rickets (HVDRR), which is caused by inactivating mutations of the vitamin D
receptor.

Most vitamin D is stored in the form of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which has only weak activity. In
response to parathyroid hormone (PTH), it is converted to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the
primary active form, by 1-alpha-hydroxylase in the kidneys. The action of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D is mediated by the vitamin D receptor; prominent effects include increases
in intestinal calcium absorption, renal calcium and phosphate reabsorption, and bone
mineralization.

In patients with HVDRR, as in those with severe nutritional vitamin D deficiency, lack of
vitamin D effect leads to hypocalcemia (decreased intestinal absorption); the compensatory
rise in PTH causes increased bone resorption and renal calcium reabsorption to partially
correct the circulating calcium deficit but causes renal phosphorus wasting as well. The
high levels of PTH also induce greater 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity, leading to elevated 1,25-
