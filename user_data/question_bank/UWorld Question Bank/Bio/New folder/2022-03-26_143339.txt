This patient has acute ischemic colitis, which is most likely due to embolic disease related to
his atrial fibrillation. The ischemic bowel undergoes anaerobic metabolism, causing lactate
accumulation in the blood that leads to an anion gap metabolic acidosis. Acidosis stimulates
renal ammoniagenesis, a process by which renal epithelial cells metabolize glutamine,
generating ammonium and bicarbonate. Ammonium ions are transported into the tubular fluid
and excreted in the urine while peritubular capillaries absorb bicarbonate, which functions to
buffer acids in the blood.

Under normal physiologic conditions, about half of the total amount of acid secreted in the
urine is in the form of ammonium, and the remainder is excreted primarily as titratable acids,
particularly inorganic phosphate. However, increased ammonium production is almost
entirely responsible for the increase in renal acid excretion seen with chronic acidosis.
