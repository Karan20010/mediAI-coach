This patient, with recurring abdominal pain, a positive "sonographic Murphy sign," and multiple
cholesterol gallstones, has acute cholecystitis. Water-insoluble cholesterol is secreted in
bile, where it is solubilized by detergent-like bile salts and phosphatidylcholine. If there is more
cholesterol than can be dissolved by the bile salts, it will precipitate into insoluble crystals,
leading to formation of gallstones. Risk factors for gallstone formation include obesity or rapid
weight loss, female sex, glucose intolerance, and hypomotility of the gallbladder (eg,
pregnancy, prolonged fasting).

Fibrate medications (eg, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) upregulate lipoprotein lipase, resulting in
increased oxidation of fatty acids. In addition, fibrates inhibit cholesterol 7a-hydroxylase,
which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of bile acids. The reduced bile acid
production results in decreased cholesterol solubility in bile and favors the formation of
cholesterol stones.

(Choice A) Estrogens increase the biosynthesis of cholesterol by upregulating hepatic HMG-
CoA reductase activity. Estrogenic medications (eg, estrogen replacement therapy, combined
oral contraceptives) increase the amount of cholesterol secreted in bile and contribute to
formation of gallstones. Aromatase catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogen;
inhibition would lead to reduced gallstone formation.
