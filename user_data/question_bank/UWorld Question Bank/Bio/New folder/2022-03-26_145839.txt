Educational objective:

Vitamin C is a cofactor for the hydroxylation of proline and lysine during collagen synthesis,
which is essential for maximum tensile strength. Deficiency (scurvy) is characterized by
periodontal disease, impaired wound healing, vascular wall fragility (eg, perifollicular,
subperiosteal hemorrhage), follicular hyperkeratosis, and corkscrew hairs.
