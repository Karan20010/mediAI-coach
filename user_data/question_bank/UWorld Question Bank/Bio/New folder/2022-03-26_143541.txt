A 40-year-old woman comes to the office with a 3-month history of progressively limited
physical activity due to fatigue. The patient says, "I could barely walk from my car to the
office." Medical history is significant for a positive tuberculin skin test 7 months ago with a
normal chest radiograph. She has been compliant with the prescribed treatment despite its
bitter taste. Physical examination shows a tired-appearing woman with conjunctival and
palmar pallor. Complete blood count is as follows:

Hemoglobin 9 g/dL
Hematocrit 28%

Mean corpuscular volume 72 fL

A bone marrow aspirate representative of this patient's disease process is shown below
(Prussian blue stain).
