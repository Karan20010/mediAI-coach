Educational objective:

Young children who reside in homes built before 1978 are at significant risk for lead toxicity.
Lead directly inhibits ferrochelatase and d-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) dehydratase, resulting in
anemia, ALA accumulation, and elevated zinc protoporphyrin levels. Neurotoxicity is also a
significant long-term complication.
