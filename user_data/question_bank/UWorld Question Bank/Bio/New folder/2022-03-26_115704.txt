(Choices A and D) Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO)
are responsible for inactivation of catecholamines. COMT converts epinephrine to
metanephrine and norepinephrine to normetanephrine; MAO converts metanephrine and
normetanephrine to vanillylmandelic acid.

(Choices E and G) Tyrosine required for the synthesis of catecholamines is obtained from
either dietary intake or by conversion of phenylalanine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in the
liver. Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme causes phenylketonuria. Tyrosine
hydroxylase deficiency impairs catecholamine synthesis and causes infantile parkinsonism
and progressive encephalopathy.

Educational objective:

Cortisol increases the conversion of norepinephrine to epinephrine in the adrenal medulla by
increasing the expression of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase.
