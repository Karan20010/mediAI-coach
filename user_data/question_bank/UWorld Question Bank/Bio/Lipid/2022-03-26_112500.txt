a Treatment of acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency consists of prevention of fat catabolism.
This means avoiding prolonged fasting as well as promptly supplying glucose during periods
of illness.

(Choice A) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first step in
fatty acid synthesis. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is normally suppressed during prolonged fasting.

(Choices B, D, and E) Acid alpha-glucosidase, glucose 6-phosphatase, and glycogen
phosphorylase are involved in glycogenolysis. Deficiency of any of these enzymes can lead to
glycogen storage disease. However, patients with glycogen storage disease have normal fatty
acid oxidation and produce ketones during periods of fasting.

Educational objective:

Impaired beta-oxidation of fatty acids causes hypoglycemia after prolonged fasting and
insufficient levels of ketone bodies. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase catalyzes the first step in the
beta-oxidation pathway and is the most commonly deficient enzyme.
