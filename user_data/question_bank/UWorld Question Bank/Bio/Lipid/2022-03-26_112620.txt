cysteine, and glycine). It is an important antioxidant and plays a role in DNA synthesis and
repair.

(Choice D) Homocysteine is an amino acid that is synthesized from methionine. Using
vitamin cofactors, it can be converted to cysteine (pyridoxine) or recycled into methionine
(cobalamin).

(Choice E) Lactate is produced from pyruvate under anaerobic conditions. Patients with
carnitine deficiency synthesize lactate normally but may produce increased lactate during
times of catabolic stress due to inability to utilize fatty acids for energy production.

(Choice F) Palmitate is a fatty acid that can be ingested or synthesized from carbohydrates.
Palmitate synthesis occurs in the cytosol and would not be affected by carnitine deficiency.

Educational objective:

Carnitine deficiency impairs fatty acid transport from the cytoplasm into mitochondria,
preventing B-oxidation of fatty acids into acetyl CoA. This leads to cardiac and skeletal
myocyte injury (lack of ATP from citric acid cycle) and impaired ketone body production by the
liver during fasting periods.
