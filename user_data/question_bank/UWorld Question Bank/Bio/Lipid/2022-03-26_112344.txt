short supply and acetyl-CoA is in excess.

(Choice B) Carnitine is an amino acid that is essential for the transport of fatty acids through
the mitochondrial membrane. It is a necessary component of fatty acid oxidation.

(Choice C) Citrate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle. It can be exported out of the
mitochondrial matrix and into the cytosol, where it is broken down into acetyl-CoA for use in de
novo fatty acid synthesis.

(Choice E) NADPH is a reducing molecule necessary for the synthesis of fatty acids. In
contrast, beta-oxidation of fats produces FADH, and NADH-reducing equivalents.

Educational objective:

Cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase converts acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA during the rate-limiting
step of de novo fatty acid synthesis. Malonyl-CoA also inhibits the action of mitochondrial
carnitine acyltransferase, thereby inhibiting beta-oxidation of newly formed fatty acids.
