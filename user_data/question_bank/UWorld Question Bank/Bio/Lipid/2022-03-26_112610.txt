This patient's myopathy (eg, elevated creatine kinase, weakness), cardiomyopathy (eg, S3
gallop), and hypoketotic hypoglycemia (eg, absence of ketones in the urine) in the setting of
decreased muscle carnitine content is consistent with primary carnitine deficiency. The
condition is caused by a defect in the protein responsible for carnitine transport across the
mitochondrial membrane. Without sufficient carnitine, fatty acids cannot be transported from
the cytoplasm into the mitochondria as acyl-carnitine (carnitine shuttle). The mitochondria
therefore cannot B-oxidize the fatty acids into acetyl CoA, the carbon substrate for the citric
acid cycle. As a result, cardiac and skeletal myocytes cannot generate ATP from fatty acids
(leading to muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy) and the liver is unable to synthesize ketone
bodies (manifests as hypoketotic hypoglycemia).

Hypoketotic hypoglycemia is also seen in other fatty acid oxidation disorders (eg, acyl CoA
dehydrogenase deficiency).

(Choice B) Arachidonic acid can be ingested or synthesized from phospholipids in the cell
membrane. Its eicosanoid derivatives (eg, prostanoids, leukotrienes) are important modulators
of inflammation. It is not affected by carnitine levels.

(Choice C) Glutathione is a tripeptide that can be synthesized from amino acids (glutamate,
cysteine, and glycine). It is an important antioxidant and plays a role in DNA synthesis and
