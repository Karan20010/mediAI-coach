The Southern, Western, Northern and Southwestern blot procedures are techniques used to
analyze and identify DNA fragments, proteins, mRNA, and DNA-bound proteins, respectively.
The best method for determining whether a gene is undergoing transcription is to analyze for
the presence of its mRNA using a Northern blot. In the case described above, Northern blot
analysis of each of the cell culture samples can determine if mRNA corresponding to the gene
of interest is being transcribed.

All of the "blot" tests rely on the same basic techniques. First, the components of the unknown
sample — DNA for Southern blots, mRNA for Northern blots, protein for Western blots, and
DNA-bound protein for Southwestern blots — are separated by size and charge via gel
electrophoresis. The resultant bands are then blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and
incubated with a labeled hybridization probe or antibody to identify the specific DNA fragment,
mRNA molecule or protein of interest.

(Choice B) Acomplete failure of gene expression would lead to a failure to produce the
protein, which can be detected by Western blotting. However, the question is asking how to
determine if the gene is being transcribed (genes may be transcribed but not properly
expressed if there is a problem with protein translation). As transcription refers to the
production of mRNA from a DNA template, a test that detects specific mRNA sequences
