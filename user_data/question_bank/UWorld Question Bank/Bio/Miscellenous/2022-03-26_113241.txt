I

This patient most likely had Hurler syndrome (type | mucopolysaccharidosis), an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, corneal clouding, and
coarse facial features (eg, frontal bossing, broad nose, flat midface). Hepatosplenomegaly
and heart disease are also typical findings.

Mucopolysaccharidoses are lysosomal storage disorders resulting from the defective
metabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are long, unbranched polysaccharides
that are an important component of the ground substance within the extracellular matrix of
connective tissues. Hurler syndrome is caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase,
which hydrolyzes dermatan and heparan sulfate. Hunter syndrome, a less severe disease
than Hurler syndrome, also results in an accumulation of dermatan and heparan sulfate but
characteristically does not cause corneal clouding.

Patients with Hurler syndrome have a shortened life expectancy. Death, typically in early
childhood, is usually caused by cardiac complications (eg, myocardial infarction); this child's
death from coronary artery disease was likely due to deposition of dermatan and heparan
sulfate within the vessels.

(Choice A) Premature coronary artery disease is seen with familial hypercholesterolemia.
