Row fe

production of MRNA from a DNA template, a test that detects specific mRNA sequences
(Northern blot) would be most appropriate.

(Choices C and D) This patient's mutation in a non-coding DNA sequence (likely affecting a
promotor or enhancer region) is resulting in decreased gene expression. A Southern or
Southwestern blot could potentially be used to detect the mutated DNA sequence and assess
for transcription factor binding. However, the degree of transcription of the affected gene is
better assessed through direct detection of its associated mRNA.

(Choice E) The ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) is a test commonly employed
to measure the amount of a protein in body fluids. It can be quantitative, for example, to
measure plasma insulin levels.

Educational objective:
Northern blots detect target MRNA in a sample and can be used to assess the degree of gene

transcription.
