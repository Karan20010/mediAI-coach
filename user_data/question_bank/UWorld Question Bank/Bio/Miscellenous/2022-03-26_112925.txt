sequence of interest.

(Choices B and E) RT-PCR amplification uses an mRNA template, so it cannot detect
changes in the parts of the gene that are not transcribed (eg, promoter and enhancer
regions). Other PCR techniques that use chromosomal DNA can detect changes in these
nontranscribed regions.

(Choice C) RT-PCR is used to detect levels of MRNA expression; it does not identify
proteins. A Western blot study can detect the BCR-ABL protein by using monoclonal
antibodies directed against BCR or ABL.

Educational objective:

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect and quantify
levels of MRNA in a sample. It uses reverse transcription to create a complementary DNA
template that is then amplified using the standard PCR procedure. RT-PCR can be used to
diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia by identifying an mRNA transcript containing both
BCR and ABL exons in affected cells.
