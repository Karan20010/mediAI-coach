(Choice A) Premature coronary artery disease is seen with familial hypercholesterolemia.

I

Cholesterol deposits can lead to tendon xanthomas, xanthelasmas (ie, eyelid plaques), and/or
corneal arcus (ie, gray ring around the cornea) but not coarse facial features, intellectual
disability, or a diffuse corneal haze.

(Choice B) Accumulation of glucocerebroside within mononuclear cells is seen in Gaucher
disease, an autosomal recessive defect in beta-glucocerebrosidase. This condition is
characterized by bruising due to thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, progressive
neurologic deterioration, and severe bone pain. Premature coronary artery disease does not
occur.

(Choice C) Glycogen storage diseases cause defective metabolism of glycogen in the liver
and/or muscles. The presentation can include hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly,
growth retardation, and/or muscle fatigue/cramping. Cardiomegaly can occur with Pompe
disease, but corneal clouding is not a feature.

(Choice E) Niemann-Pick disease results from a deficiency of sphingomyelinase, which leads
to the accumulation of sphingomyelin within phagocytes. This disease is characterized by
hepatosplenomegaly and progressive neurologic deterioration, but eye findings include a

cherry-red spot on the macula, not corneal clouding.
