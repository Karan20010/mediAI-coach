Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used to detect and quantify
levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a sample. It is similar to regular PCR in that it uses
sequence-specific primers, thermostable DNA polymerase, and a pool of deoxyribonucleoside
triphosphates to amplify a DNA template. In RT-PCR, this template is generated by the action
of reverse transcriptase on the mRNA sample, producing a complementary DNA (cDNA)
strand that can then be amplified by PCR. Because cDNA is complementary to the mRNA
sequence, it contains the exons of a gene along with the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions.

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of the
myeloid stem cell line due to a chromosomal translocation. This translocation causes the BCR
gene on chromosome 22 to fuse with the ABL gene on chromosome 9, forming the BCR-ABL
fusion gene. The BCR-ABL fusion protein product is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that
accelerates cell division and increases genetic instability. RT-PCR can be used to identify
mRNA transcribed from the BCR-ABL fusion gene and therefore diagnose CML.

(Choice A) Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques allow direct localization of
genes to their respective chromosomes by using a labeled DNA probe complementary to the

sequence of interest.
