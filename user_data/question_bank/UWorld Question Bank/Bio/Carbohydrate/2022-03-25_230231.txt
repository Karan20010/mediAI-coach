Myocardial dysfunction due to thiamine deficiency is referred to as wet beriberi. Infantile
beriberi is rare but often fulminant, with symptoms related to pulmonary/systemic fluid
overload, including feeding intolerance and respiratory distress, as well as cardiomegaly and

hepatomegaly, as seen in this patient. Wet beriberi can be fatal without prompt thiamine
supplementation.
