(Choices A and B) Phosphoglucomutase interconverts glucose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-
phosphate. This enzyme links glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, and glycolysis.

(Choice D) This reaction is the final step in both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in the
liver. It is catalyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase and results in the liberation of a free glucose
molecule. Enzyme deficiency results in glycogen storage disease type I.

(Choice E) This reaction is the first step in glycolysis and is catalyzed by hexokinase or
glucokinase. Hexokinase deficiency is a rare cause of hemolytic anemia, and glucokinase
deficiency has been linked to hyperglycemic states and diabetes.

(Choices F and G) Interconversion of glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate is
catalyzed by the bidirectional enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase. Enzyme deficiency is
responsible for a small percentage of hemolytic anemias.

Educational objective:

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose
phosphate pathway. G6PD deficiency is a common X-linked recessive disorder resulting in
episodes of hemolytic anemia during times of increased oxidative stress (eg, use of
antimalarials/sulfonamide, infections).
