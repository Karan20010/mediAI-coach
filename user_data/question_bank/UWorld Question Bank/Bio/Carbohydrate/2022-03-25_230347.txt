(Choice F) In glycolysis, pyruvate is formed from phosphoenolpyruvate by a unidirectional
enzyme called pyruvate kinase. In the absence of lactate dehydrogenase activity, pyruvate will
accumulate in the cell under anaerobic conditions.

Educational objective:

Under anaerobic conditions, NADH transfers electrons to pyruvate to form lactate and
regenerate NAD-. NAD- is required to convert glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to 1-3-
bisphosphoglycerate in glycolysis.
