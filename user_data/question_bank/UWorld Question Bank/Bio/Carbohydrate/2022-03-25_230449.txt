In patients with G6PD deficiency, erythrocytes are unable to maintain a sufficient supply of
reduced glutathione during periods of increased oxidative stress, which can occur with certain
infections (eg, pneumonia, viral hepatitis), consumption of fava beans, or specific medications
(eg, primaquine, sulfa drugs). The resulting oxidative damage causes acute hemolytic

anemia and jaundice.
