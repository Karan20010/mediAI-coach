Nutrition researchers investigating the relationship between fructose consumption and
cardiovascular disease conduct a prospective cohort study on a population of randomly
selected young adults. Study participants undergo semiannual measurement of waist
circumference, blood pressure, and serum cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Dietary
fructose consumption is assessed through the use of questionnaires and by measuring urinary
fructose excretion. A 23-year-old man enrolled in the study is found to excrete large amounts
of fructose in his urine compared to other study participants despite maintaining a moderate
fructose intake. Further evaluation shows a hereditary defect in fructose metabolism, but he is
asymptomatic and has no other medical problems. This patient most likely remains able to
metabolize fructose due to the compensatory activity of which of the following enzymes?

A. Aldolase B (28%)

B. Aldose reductase (15%)

C. Fructokinase (21%)
YD. Hexokinase (30%)

E. UDP-galactose-4-epimerase (4%)
