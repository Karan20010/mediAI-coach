Educational objective:

Decreased erythrocyte transketolase activity is seen with deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B,),
which is a cofactor for several enzymes (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase) involved in glucose
metabolism. Severe deficiency can lead to heart failure (wet beriberi), which in infants may
manifest as respiratory distress and feeding intolerance with cardiomegaly and hepatomegaly.
