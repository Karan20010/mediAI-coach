(Choice A) Lactase hydrolyzes lactose to galactose in the small intestine. Primary lactase
deficiency causes lactose intolerance and is rare in neonates.

(Choice B) Aldose reductase converts galactose to galactitol. GALT and GALK deficiency
can lead to galactitol accumulation in the lens, which can lead to cataract formation in patients
with galactosemia. However, aldose reductase deficiency does not cause galactosemia.

(Choice C) GALK phosphorylates galactose and its deficiency typically causes less severe
manifestations of galactosemia with cataract formation (due to galactitol) being the most
common manifestation. Because galactose-1-phosphate does not accumulate, liver and renal
functions are preserved.

(Choice E) Phosphoglucomutase isomerizes glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate,
which then enters the glycolytic pathway. Its deficiency is rare. In GALT deficiency,
accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate blocks phosphoglucomutase, thereby preventing
energy production via glycolysis.

Educational objective:

Classic galactosemia results from deficiency of galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase.
Clinical features include vomiting, lethargy, jaundice, and Escherichia coli sepsis. Cessation of

breastfeeding and switching to soy milk-based formula is recommended.
