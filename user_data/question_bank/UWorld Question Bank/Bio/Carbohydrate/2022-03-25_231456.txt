This patient has acute mesenteric ischemia, with inadequate delivery of oxygen to intestinal
tissues. During glycolysis, the concentration of oxygen in the tissues affects the metabolic fate
of pyruvate. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is preferentially converted to acetyl
coenzyme A by pyruvate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix. Acetyl coenzyme A then
undergoes oxidation in the citric acid (TCA) cycle. However, under hypoxic conditions,
intracellular accumulation of NADH inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase. As a result, increased
amounts of pyruvate are converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (Choice B), which
regenerates NAD: from NADH (allowing for limited ATP production via anaerobic glycolysis).
With significant tissue ischemia, lactate begins to accumulate in the circulation and can lead to
lactic acidosis. Patients with lactic (or other metabolic) acidosis will typically hyperventilate to
eliminate CO, and induce a compensatory respiratory alkalosis.

(Choices A and E) 2-phosphoglycerate is converted to phosphoenolpyruvate by the enzyme

enolase. Phosphoenolpyruvate is subsequently metabolized to pyruvate by pyruvate kinase.
These reactions are performed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

(Choice C) Pyruvate can also be converted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. This
enzyme is involved in regeneration of glucose from pyruvate by the process of

gluconeogenesis.
