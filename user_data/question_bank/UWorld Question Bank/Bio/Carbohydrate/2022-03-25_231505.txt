Educational objective:

In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate produced during glycolysis is converted by pyruvate
dehydrogenase to acetyl coenzyme A, which is subsequently metabolized by oxidative
phosphorylation. However, if inadequate oxygen is present in the tissues, pyruvate is
converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase, leading to lactic acidosis.
