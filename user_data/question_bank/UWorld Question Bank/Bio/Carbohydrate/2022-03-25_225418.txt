(Choice A) Conversion of acetoacetyl-CoA to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA occurs during
the synthesis of cholesterol and ketone bodies. Ketone body synthesis is increased in
starvation situations, however, ketone bodies cannot be used to synthesize glucose.
(Choice B) Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced from acetyl CoA during lipogenesis in

the fed state. However, during prolonged fasting, lipolysis predominates and leads to
generation of glycerol and fatty acids.

(Choice C) Conversion of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate occurs during
glycolysis and is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase. During starvation, glycolysis is minimized
and gluconeogenesis predominates.

(Choice D) The first step of glycogenolysis is breakage of 1-4 glycosidic linkage to form
glucose-1-phosphate. After 24 hours of fasting, maintenance of blood glucose levels is
achieved mostly through gluconeogenesis, not by glycogenolysis.

Educational objective:

After 12-18 hours of fasting, gluconeogenesis becomes the principal source of blood glucose.
Gluconeogenesis uses many glycolytic enzymes, but hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, and
pyruvate kinase need to be bypassed as they are unidirectional. The initial steps of

gluconeogenesis involve the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate and oxaloacetate to
