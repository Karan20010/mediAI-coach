nonoxidative reactions are responsible for conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-
phosphate.

(Choice D) Glutathione reductase catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide to
glutathione using NADPH. Glutathione aids red blood cells in resisting oxidative stress.

Educational objective:

The pentose phosphate pathway consists of an oxidative (irreversible) branch and a
nonoxidative (reversible) branch, and each can function independently based on cellular
requirements. Transketolase, an enzyme of the nonoxidative branch, is responsible in part for
the interconversion of ribose-5-phosphate (nucleotide precursor) and fructose-6-phosphate
(glycolytic intermediate).
