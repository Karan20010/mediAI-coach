Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.
Disaccharides and polysaccharides must be broken down to their monosaccharide

components for energy production and utilization.

Aldolase B metabolizes fructose-1-phosphate, a product of fructose metabolism, to
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and glyceraldehyde, which can then enter the glycolytic
pathway. Aldolase B deficiency can result in fructose-1-phosphate accumulation; this toxic
metabolite depletes intracellular phosphate and inhibits the activation of hepatic phosphorylase
and gluconeogenesis. The resulting condition, hereditary fructose intolerance (eg,
fructosemia), is an autosomal recessive disorder.

Because gluconeogenesis is impaired, fructosemia typically presents with life-threatening
hypoglycemia. Consequences of hypoglycemia include lethargy, sweating, vomiting, and
dehydration. These symptoms manifest after intake of fructose or sucrose, such as from
formula or fruit. Strict abstinence from dietary fructose and sucrose can result in dramatic

recovery.

carbohydrates in plants and contains only glucose molecules. Starch consists of an
