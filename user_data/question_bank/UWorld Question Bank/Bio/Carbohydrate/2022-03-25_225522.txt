(Choice A) Aldolase B plays a nonessential role in glycolysis due to the redundant function of
aldolase A. However, it is particularly important during fructose metabolism as deficiency of
this enzyme leads to toxic accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate (hereditary fructose
intolerance). This life-threatening disorder presents in infancy after the introduction of
fructose-containing foods.

(Choice B) Aldose reductase is the enzyme that converts glucose to sorbitol. Aldose
reductase has a low affinity for glucose, and normally only very small amounts of glucose are
metabolized by this enzyme. The amount of glucose metabolized by the aldose reductase
pathway increases significantly in diabetes mellitus and contributes to chronic complications
such as neuropathy and retinopathy.

(Choice E) UDP-galactose-4-epimerase is involved in the metabolism of galactose; it does
not play a role in fructose metabolism.

Educational objective:

Essential fructosuria is a benign disorder of fructose metabolism caused by fructokinase
deficiency. In patients with essential fructosuria, some of the dietary fructose load is converted
by hexokinase to fructose-6-phosphate, which can then enter glycolysis; this pathway is not

cjiaqnificant in normal individuals.
