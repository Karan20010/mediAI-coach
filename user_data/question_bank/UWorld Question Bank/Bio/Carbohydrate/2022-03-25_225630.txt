This patient likely has pellagra, a disease characterized by photosensitive dermatitis, diarrhea,
and dementia occurring secondary to vitamin B, (niacin) deficiency. Pellagra is
predominantly seen in malnourished populations (eg, those with alcohol use disorder or
malabsorption).

Niacin is a precursor for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), two important cofactors for many dehydrogenase and
reductase enzymes. NAD is required for catabolic reactions (eg, glycolysis, beta-oxidation)
as well as cell signaling and DNA repair, whereas NADP is necessary for many anabolic
reactions such as fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. NAD is a key constituent of the citric
acid cycle; it serves as a cofactor for isocitrate dehydrogenase, alpha-ketoglutarate
dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase.
