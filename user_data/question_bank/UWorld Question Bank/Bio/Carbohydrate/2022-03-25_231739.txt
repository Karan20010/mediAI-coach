fructose.

(Choice D) Galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by galactose-1-
phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency. It is characterized by neonatal jaundice, vomiting,
cataract formation, hepatomegaly, and failure to thrive. Treatment includes elimination of all
milk products from the diet and feeding with soy-based infant formula.

(Choice E) Lactase is a mucosal enzyme responsible for the digestion of lactose. Acquired
lactase deficiency is the most common cause of selective carbohydrate malabsorption.
Patients with lactase deficiency experience gastrointestinal symptoms (eg, bloating, diarrhea)
following the ingestion of dairy products.

Educational objective:

Unlike hereditary fructose intolerance (aldolase B deficiency) and classic galactosemia
(galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency), essential fructosuria (fructokinase
deficiency) is a benign disorder. Although affected patients are asymptomatic, their urine will
test positive for a reducing sugar due to the presence of unmetabolized fructose.
