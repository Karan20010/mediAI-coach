(Choices C, D, and E) Other glycogen storage diseases are caused by deficiencies of
glucose-6-phosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen debrancher enzyme
(debranching enzyme). However, glycogen accumulation within lysosomal vacuoles is specific
for acid alpha-glucosidase deficiency.

(Choice F) Pyruvate kinase deficiency causes chronic hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and
iron overload as a result of impaired erythrocyte survival.

Educational objective:

Acid maltase (alpha-glucosidase) deficiency presents in early infancy with cardiomegaly,
macroglossia, and profound muscular hypotonia. Abnormal glycogen accumulation within
lysosomal vesicles is seen on muscle biopsy.
