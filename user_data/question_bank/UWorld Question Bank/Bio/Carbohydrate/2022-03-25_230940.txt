Galactosemia results from deficiency of enzymes involved in galactose metabolism. First,
lactose is broken down to galactose and glucose. Galactose is then phosphorylated to
galactose-1-phosphate by the enzyme galactokinase (GALK). GALK deficiency causes
galactose buildup and this excess is converted to galactitol, an osmotic agent that causes
cataracts. Excess galactose also spills into the urine and causes it to test positive for a
reducing substance. Serious systemic manifestations are not seen in GALK deficiency, and
cataracts may be the only manifestation.

In contrast, deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) results
in a more serious form of galactosemia. This is related to the accumulation of galactose-1-
phosphate, a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic and renal dysfunction. Consequently,
patients with GALT deficiency present early, in the neonatal period, with vomiting, lethargy, and
failure to thrive.

This patient's late presentation, normal growth, and the isolated presence of cataract are
indicative of GALK deficiency. Infants born in the United States undergo routine newborn
screens for detecting inborn errors of metabolism, such as galactosemia.
