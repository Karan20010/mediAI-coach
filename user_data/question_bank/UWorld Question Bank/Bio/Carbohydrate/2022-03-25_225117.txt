The metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase reduces
NAD: to NADH and increases the NADH/NAD: ratio. This inhibits all other pathways requiring
NAD-, including reactions required for gluconeogenesis. In particular, lactate cannot be
converted to pyruvate, and instead the reaction is driven from pyruvate toward lactate. In
addition, excess NADH inhibits the conversion of malate to oxaloacetate. Pyruvate and
oxaloacetate are intermediates in gluconeogenesis; therefore, conversion of these molecules
to lactate and malate inhibits gluconeogenesis.

Alcohol does not inhibit glycogenolysis (Choice B), and so in the initial phase of binge drinking
(heavy alcohol intake with reduced nutritional carbohydrate intake), hepatic glycogenolysis is
able to maintain euglycemia. However, after a prolonged binge, hepatic glycogen is eventually
depleted and blood glucose levels drop.
