Question Id: 1036

This patient is likely suffering from glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency,
an X-linked recessive disorder resulting in episodic bouts of hemolysis when red blood cells

experience increased oxidative stress.

G6PD is the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This enzyme
catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, which is
subsequently converted to 6-phosphogluconate. The PPP serves to generate both NADPH
and ribose-5-phosphate, a precursor for nucleotide synthesis. Red blood cells utilize
reduced NADPH to maintain a steady supply of glutathione, a molecule capable of
neutralizing free radicals and therefore protecting the cells against oxidative damage. As the
PPP is the only mechanism for red blood cells to generate NADPH, enzymatic defects in the
pathway increase their susceptibility to oxidative damage.

Increased oxidative stress can occur as a result of exposure to medications (eg,
antimalarials, sulfonamides), certain foods (eg, fava beans), and infection. This patient was
likely treated with a sulfonamide drug for his bacterial skin infection, which precipitated
hemolytic anemia. Oxidative damage to red blood cells also causes hemoglobin to denature,
forming insoluble Heinz bodies that are removed in the spleen (produces characteristic bite
cells).
