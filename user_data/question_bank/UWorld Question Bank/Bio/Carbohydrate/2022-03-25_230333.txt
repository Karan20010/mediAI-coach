In glycolysis, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate. Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate is
converted to acetyl-CoA to enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. When oxygen is depleted
(eg, in exercising muscle), pyruvate is converted to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis).

During glycolysis, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is converted to 1-3-bisphosphoglycerate
(BPG) by the enzyme G3P dehydrogenase. This enzyme reduces NAD- to NADH. NAD: is
present in limited amounts in most cells, and it must be regenerated from NADH for glycolysis
to continue. Under aerobic conditions, NAD- is converted to NADH in the TCA cycle. NADH is
then reconverted to NAD- in the electron transport chain as the energy in NADH is utilized to

synthesize ATP.

In anaerobic glycolysis, NAD+ is regenerated from NADH when pyruvate is converted to
lactate via lactate dehydrogenase. In patients with lactate dehydrogenase deficiency,
glycolysis is inhibited in strenuously exercising muscle as muscle cells cannot regenerate
NAD-. Consequently, high-intensity physical activity leads to muscle breakdown, pain, and

fatigue as insufficient amounts of energy are being produced in the exercising muscle.
