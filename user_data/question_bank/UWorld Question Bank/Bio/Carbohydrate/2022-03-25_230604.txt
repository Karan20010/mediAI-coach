(Choices A and D) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency (classic
galactosemia) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by vomiting, feeding

intolerance, neonatal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and death if untreated. Symptoms start soon
after breastfeeding is initiated. Galactokinase deficiency is a more benign disorder of
galactose metabolism that results in the formation of neonatal cataracts.

(Choice C) Fructokinase deficiency causes essential fructosuria, a benign autosomal

recessive disorder. Fructose from the diet is absorbed and secreted freely in the urine due to

impairment of the first step in fructose metabolism.

(Choice E) Glycogenolysis is accomplished mainly by glycogen phosphorylase and
debranching enzyme, but a small amount is also broken down by the lysosomal enzyme a-1,4-
glucosidase. Alpha-glucosidase (or acid maltase) deficiency causes Pompe disease. This
disease presents not with hypoglycemia, but with cardiomyopathy and hypotonia.

Educational objective:

Aldolase B deficiency causes hereditary fructose intolerance. This disease manifests after
introduction of fructose into the diet with vomiting and hypoglycemia about 20-30 minutes after
fructose ingestion. These infants can present with failure to thrive, jaundice, and
hepatomegaly.
