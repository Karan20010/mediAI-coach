(Choice A) Alpha-1,4-glucosidase deficiency (Pompe disease) causes cardiomegaly due to
glycogen accumulation in myocytes; heart failure can lead to hepatomegaly. Infants typically
have profound weakness and hypotonia, findings not present in this patient. Moreover, ETKA
and lactate would be normal.

(Choice B) Alpha-L-iduronidase deficiency (Hurler syndrome) results in the accumulation of
glycosaminoglycans and often presents with hepatomegaly; heart failure can also occur. In
contrast to this patient, characteristic coarse facial features and recurrent respiratory infections
are expected; serum lactate and ETKA would be normal.

(Choice C) Galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency (galactosemia) results in
impaired galactose metabolism. Hepatomegaly and vomiting are common but typically
develop in the first week of life and are associated with jaundice and hypotonia. ETKA would
be normal.

(Choice D) Glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (von Gierke disease) results in accumulation
of glycogen in the liver, causing hepatomegaly; lactic acidosis is common. However,
cardiomegaly would not be seen, and ETKA would be normal.
