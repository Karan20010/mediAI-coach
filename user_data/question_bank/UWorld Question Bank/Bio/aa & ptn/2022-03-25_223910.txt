Impaired transport of ornithine into the mitochondria can be caused by ornithine translocase
deficiency, which results in a defect in the hepatic urea cycle. The urea cycle converts
ammonia, which is generated from the catabolism of amino acids, into urea for excretion in
urine. Urea cycle defects cause ammonia to accumulate in the blood, resulting in
progressive lethargy, vomiting, seizures, and cerebral edema (may cause hyperreflexia and
abnormal posturing when severe) in infancy and early childhood; milder defects caused by
partial enzyme deficiencies may not manifest until adulthood.

Effective treatment of urea cycle disorders requires balancing dietary protein intake and
metabolic requirements. Protein restriction is the main treatment for urea cycle disorders,
such that the body receives the essential amino acids needed for growth and development but
not in excess such that excessive ammonia is formed. Medications that provide an alternate
pathway to excrete nitrogen (eg, phenylacetate) are also used to help remove ammonia from
the blood.
