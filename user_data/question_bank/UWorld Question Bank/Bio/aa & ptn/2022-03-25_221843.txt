Catabolism of several essential amino acids (valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine)
along with odd-chain fatty acids results in the generation of propionyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is
subsequently converted to methylmalonyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by biotin-dependent
propionyl-CoA carboxylase. Isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA then generates succinyl-
CoA, which enters the TCA cycle.

This patient's presentation is consistent with propionic acidemia, an autosomal recessive
organic acidemia caused by congenital deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase. This enzyme
catalyzes the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA. In its absence, excess
propionic acid accumulates in the bloodstream, causing severe metabolic acidosis.
Hypoglycemia and ketosis frequently develop secondary to the acidosis. Affected patients
present 1-2 weeks after birth with lethargy, poor feeding, vomiting, and hypotonia. Treatment
involves starting a low-protein diet containing minimal amounts of valine, isoleucine,
methionine, and threonine.
