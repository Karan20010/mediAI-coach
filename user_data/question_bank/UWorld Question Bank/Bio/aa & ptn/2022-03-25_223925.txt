(Choice G) Pyridoxine (vitamin B,) can be used to treat homocystinuria, which is caused by a
defect in vitamin B,-dependent cystathionine synthase. This condition is characterized by

elevated homocysteine levels, ectopia lentis, intellectual disability, Marfanoid body habitus,
and increased occurrence of thromboembolic events.

Educational objective:

Ornithine transport into mitochondria is necessary for proper function of the urea cycle, which
is the major disposal pathway for waste nitrogen generated by catabolism of amino acids.
Urea cycle defects typically cause neurological damage due to the accumulation of ammonia.
Protein restriction improves this condition by reducing the amount of amino acid turnover.
