Alanine and glutamine play an important role in transporting nitrogen throughout the body.
Glutamine is produced by most body tissues and is catabolized primarily by the gut and kidney
for maintenance of cellular metabolism and acid-base regulation, respectively. A significant
portion of the glutamine used by these tissues is converted to alanine and released into the
circulation. Alanine is also released by skeletal muscle tissue during protein catabolism as
part of the glucose-alanine cycle that helps remove excess nitrogen. Alanine is then
transported to the liver, where it serves as a vehicle for nitrogen disposal and as a source of
carbon skeletons for gluconeogenesis.

In the liver, alanine is transaminated by alanine aminotransferase to pyruvate with the amino
group being transferred to a-ketoglutarate to form glutamate. Almost all aminotransferase
enzymes use a-ketoglutarate as the amino group acceptor. Thus, amino groups are funneled
into glutamate during protein catabolism. Glutamate is further metabolized by the enzyme
glutamate dehydrogenase, which liberates free ammonia and regenerates a-ketoglutarate.
Ammonia then enters the urea cycle to form urea, the primary disposal form of nitrogen in
humans. Urea subsequently enters the blood and is excreted in the urine.
