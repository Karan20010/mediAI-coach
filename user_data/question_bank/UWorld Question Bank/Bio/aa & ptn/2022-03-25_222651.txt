Question Id: 1332
(Choice A) The enzyme asparagine synthase converts aspartate to asparagine, the amino
acid that is essential for rapidly dividing tumor cells that cannot produce it quickly enough on
their own. The chemotherapy drug asparaginase decreases asparagine concentration in
tumor cells and leads to lysis of these rapidly growing cells.

(Choices C, D, and F) Maple syrup urine disease is an amino acid disorder caused by
deficiency of branched-chain a-ketoacid dehydrogenase. This deficiency leads to toxic buildup
of branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their metabolites, resulting
in feeding difficulties, seizures, cerebral edema, and a sweet odor of the urine.

(Choice E) Phenylalanine hydroxylase catalyzes the hydroxylation of the essential amino acid
phenylalanine to form tyrosine. Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase is the most common
cause of phenylketonuria, which results in severe intellectual disability if left untreated.

Educational objective:

Homocystinuria is most commonly caused by a defect in cystathionine synthase, resulting in
an inability to form cysteine from homocysteine. Cysteine becomes essential in affected
patients, and homocysteine buildup leads to elevated methionine. Homocysteine is
prothrombotic, resulting in premature thromboembolic events (eg, atherosclerosis, acute

coronary syndrome) in these patients.
