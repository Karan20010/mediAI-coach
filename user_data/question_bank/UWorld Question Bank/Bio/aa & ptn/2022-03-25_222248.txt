(Choice A) Branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase catalyzes decarboxylation of the a-
ketoacid derivatives of all 3 branched chain amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, and valine.
Deficiency causes maple syrup urine disease, which is characterized by a burnt-sugar smell in
the urine of affected patients. Hypopigmentation is not seen in the condition.

(Choice B) Dopamine hydroxylase is the enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of
norepinephrine from dopamine. Deficiency of this enzyme causes a rare form of
dysautonomia characterized by ptosis, orthostatic hypotension, hypoglycemia, and
hypothermia.

(Choice C) Alkaptonuria is an autosomal recessive disorder of tyrosine degradation caused
by a deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase. This condition results in the accumulation of
large amounts of homogentisic acid, leading to connective tissue hyperpigmentation and
degenerative joint disease.

(Choice E) Albinism is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by defects in the biosynthesis
and distribution of melanin. It is most commonly due to depressed or absent tyrosinase
activity. Melanin synthesis begins with the conversion of tyrosine to DOPA and DOPA to
dopaquinone by the enzyme tyrosinase in melanocytes. Albinism does not present with

neurologic dysfunction.
