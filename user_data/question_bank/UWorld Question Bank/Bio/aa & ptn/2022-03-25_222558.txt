alpha chains.
(Choices A, B, D, E, and F) None of the other amino acids are as abundant as glycine in
collagen. X often represents proline and Y is often hydroxyproline or hydroxylysine. Proline
residues are essential for alpha helix formation because their ring configuration introduces a
kink in the polypeptide chain, enhancing the rigidity of the helical structure. Hydroxylysine is
necessary for cross-linking, which greatly increases the tensile strength of assembled collagen
fibers.

Educational objective:

Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen. The triple helical conformation of
collagen molecules occurs due to the repetitive amino acid sequence within each alpha chain,
in which glycine (Gly) occupies every third amino acid position (Gly-X-Y).
