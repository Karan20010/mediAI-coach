(Choice B) Elastin, a fibrous protein in the connective tissue, is named for the elastic
properties it imparts to skin, blood vessels, and lung alveoli. Elastin fibers can be stretched to
several times their original length but will recoil when the stretching forces are withdrawn.
Elastin is synthesized from the polypeptide precursor tropoelastin.

(Choice C) Fibrillin-1 is a major component of the microfibrils that form a sheath around
elastin. Microfibrils are abundantly present in blood vessels and in the suspensory ligaments
of the lens. Defects in the fibrillin-1 gene cause classic autosomal dominant Marfan syndrome.

(Choice D) Hyaluronic acid is another major component of the soft tissue's extracellular
matrix, including synovial fluid and skin. Exogenous injection can be used to restore
viscoelasticity to the synovial fluid in osteoarthritis; soft-tissue fillers can also be used in
patients concerned about age-related volume loss (eg, nasolabial folds).

(Choice E) Laminins are heterotrimeric glycoproteins that bind to type IV collagen underlying
epithelial cells. They contribute to the organization and function of the basal lamina (basement
membrane).

(Choice F) Proteoglycans are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which provide
compressibility to tissues. Patients with deficiencies in lysosomal enzymes cannot break down

GAGs, resulting in mucopolysaccharidoses (eg, Hurler syndrome, Hunter syndrome
