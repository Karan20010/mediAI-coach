G protein-coupled receptors have a characteristic structure with 7 transmembrane regions, an
extracellular domain, and an intracellular domain coupled with a G protein. In their inactivated
state, G proteins exist as heterotrimers consisting of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits with
GDP tightly bound to the alpha subunit. G proteins are activated after ligand binding to the
extracellular domain of the receptor. The first step in activation occurs when GDP is
exchanged for GTP on the alpha subunit. Once bound to GTP, the alpha subunit dissociates
from the beta and gamma subunits and activates either adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C,
depending on the ligand.

When phenylephrine binds to an alpha-1 receptor on vascular smooth muscle cells, the alpha
subunit of the G protein (G,) activates phospholipase C, which breaks down
phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP;) and diacylglycerol (DAG).
DAG stimulates protein kinase C, which phosphorylates downstream intracellular proteins to
produce its physiologic effects (eg, smooth muscle contraction). IP; produces most of its
effects by increasing intracellular calcium, which also activates protein kinase C. In the
study described above, protein kinase C activity would be reduced in the experimental group
compared to the control group as calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum is
interrupted.
