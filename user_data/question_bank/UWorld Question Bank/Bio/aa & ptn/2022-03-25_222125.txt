(Choice A) Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) is required for hydroxylation of proline and lysine
residues in collagen synthesis; therefore, it plays an important role in connective tissue
maintenance and wound healing.
(Choice B) Folate participates in single carbon transfer reactions, as in the de novo synthesis

of purines and thymidine. Folate supplements will improve megaloblastic anemia resulting
from folate deficiency but will not improve the anemia in orotic aciduria.

(Choice C) Guanine and adenine are purine bases present in DNA and RNA. Orotic aciduria
is a defect in the synthesis of pyrimidine bases, so supplementation with purines would not
affect orate synthesis.

(Choice D) Iron supplementation improves iron deficiency anemia, classically a microcytic
hypochromic anemia.

(Choice E) Pyridoxine (vitamin B,) supplementation is indicated during treatment with

isoniazid. Pyridoxine is a cofactor in transamination, deamination, decarboxylation, and
condensation reactions.

Educational objective:
Orotic aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of de novo pyrimidine synthesis that
