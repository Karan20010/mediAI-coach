Educational objective:

Transamination reactions typically occur between an amino acid and an a-keto acid. The
amino group from the amino acid is transferred to the a-keto acid, and the a-keto acid in turn
becomes an amino acid. Pyridoxal phosphate (active vitamin B,) serves as a cofactor in

amino acid transamination and decarboxylation reactions.
