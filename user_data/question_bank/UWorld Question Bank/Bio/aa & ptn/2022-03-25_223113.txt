: activation of protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates intracellular proteins to
6 produce its effects.

8 (Choice B) Lipoxygenase is an enzyme responsible for the formation of leukotrienes from
= arachidonic acid. It is not directly involved in the phosphatidylinositol second messenger
it system.
12
re) (Choice C) Phosphodiesterase is an enzyme that terminates the effects of ligands that act via
cAMP or cGMP second messenger systems. It has no direct effect on the phosphatidylinositol

second messenger system.

(Choice D) The activity of phospholipase C would be unchanged if IP; were blocked because
phospholipase C exerts its effect before IP; in the phosphatidylinositol second messenger
system.

Educational objective:

After a ligand binds to a G protein-coupled receptor that activates phospholipase C, membrane
phospholipids are broken down into diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol triphosphate (IP;).

Protein kinase C is subsequently activated by DAG and calcium; the latter is released from the

endoplasmic reticulum under the influence of IP..
