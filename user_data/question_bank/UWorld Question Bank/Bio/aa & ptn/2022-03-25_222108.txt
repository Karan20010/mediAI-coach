Educational objective:

Orotic aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of de novo pyrimidine synthesis that
occurs due to a defect in uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) synthase. Children typically
present with physical and mental retardation, megaloblastic anemia, and large amounts of
urinary orotic acid. Uridine supplementation can improve symptoms as uridine is converted to
UMP via nucleoside kinases.
