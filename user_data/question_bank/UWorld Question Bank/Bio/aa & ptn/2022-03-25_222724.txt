This patient likely has Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused
by inactivating mutations affecting the neutral amino acid transporter. This results in
impaired transport of neutral amino acids, particularly tryptophan, in the small intestine and
proximal tubule of the kidney.

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and a precursor for niacin, serotonin, and melatonin.
Conversion of tryptophan to niacin is responsible for the generation of up to half of the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) required for redox reactions; the clinical
manifestations of Hartnup disease are primarily due to niacin deficiency. Patients present
with intermittent attacks of pellagra-like skin eruptions (development of a red, rough rash
following sun exposure) and cerebellar ataxia in early childhood that become less severe with
increasing age.

The diagnosis is confirmed by detecting excessive amounts of neutral amino acids (alanine,
serine, threonine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan) in the
urine (neutral aminoaciduria). A high-protein diet along with daily niacin or nicotinamide
supplementation generally results in significant symptom improvement.
