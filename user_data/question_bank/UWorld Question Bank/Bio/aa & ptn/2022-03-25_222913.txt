Educational objective:

Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate for active binding sites on enzymes. Additional
substrate is required to achieve the same rate of reaction, increasing the measured value of
the Michaelis constant (K,,). Competitive inhibitors do not affect enzyme function; therefore,

maximal velocity (V.,..) is unchanged in their presence.
