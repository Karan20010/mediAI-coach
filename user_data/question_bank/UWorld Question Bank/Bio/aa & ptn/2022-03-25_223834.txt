Educational objective:

Inclusion cell disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which a defect in protein targeting
prevents the phosphorylation of mannose residues required to tag acid hydrolases for
transport to lysosomes. Without these lysosomal proteins, cellular debris cannot be degraded
and therefore accumulates within lysosomes, forming inclusion bodies characteristic of the

disease.
