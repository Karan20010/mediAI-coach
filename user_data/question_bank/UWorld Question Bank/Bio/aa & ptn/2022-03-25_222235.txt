Educational objective:

Deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin causes
accumulation of phenylalanine in body fluids and the central nervous system. Homozygous
infants are normal at birth but gradually develop severe intellectual disability and seizures if left
untreated. Hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, eyes, and catecholaminergic brain nuclei is also

frequently seen.
