eatures (eg, coarse Tacies, corneal clouding, hepatosplenomegaly).

(Choice A) The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis prior to transport to
the Golgi apparatus for protein modification and vesicular trafficking. Retrograde transport
from the Golgi apparatus to the ER occurs via specialized protein-coated vesicles (eg, COPI).

(Choice B) Following translation in the ER, secretory proteins traverse the Golgi apparatus
and are packaged into vesicles that ultimately fuse with the plasma membrane, facilitating
extracellular protein secretion. Lysosomal proteins are inappropriately transferred to the
extracellular space in patients with I-cell disease.

(Choice D) Most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and contain specific
mitochondrial targeting sequences. Translocases detect these sequences and shuttle the
proteins into and between the different mitochondrial compartments.

(Choice E) Peripheral membrane proteins may be modified through a process in which a
hydrophobic lipid anchor is covalently attached to the protein. This process facilitates protein
interaction with the plasma membrane.

Educational objective:
Inclusion cell disease is a lysosomal storage disorder in which a defect in protein targeting

prevents the phosphorylation of mannose residues required to tag acid hydrolases for
Block Time Elapse
