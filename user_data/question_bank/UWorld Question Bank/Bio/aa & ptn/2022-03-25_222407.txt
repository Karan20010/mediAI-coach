(Choice B) The enzyme dopamine B-hydroxylase catalyzes the biosynthesis of
norepinephrine from dopamine. It does not use BH, as a cofactor.
(Choice C) Phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of PKU. This
patient's phenylalanine levels have normalized with dietary therapy, but he has low dopamine

levels (as indicated by elevated prolactin). Patients with classic PKU or phenylalanine
hydroxylase deficiency do not have any difficulty producing dopamine with adequate levels of
dietary tyrosine.

(Choice D) Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) converts norepinephrine to
epinephrine. It requires S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) as a cofactor.

(Choice E) Tyrosinase deficiency causes albinism, characterized by a lack of pigment in skin
and hair due to absent melanin production. Melanin is synthesized in melanocytes from
tyrosine by tyrosinase.

Educational objective:

Dihydrobiopterin reductase deficiency results in impaired tetrahydrobiopterin (BH,) levels. BH,
is an important cofactor for both phenylalanine hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase.
Although phenylalanine levels can be corrected with dietary restriction, downstream

deficiencies of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and serotonin lead to progressive
