Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is an enzyme complex located within the inner mitochondrial
membrane that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate. An experiment is conducted
to determine if malate alters the rate of SDH activity. Reaction velocity is measured with and

without a fixed quantity of malate as succinate concentration is gradually increased. Obtained

results are shown below.

Succinate concentration | Rate of reaction without malate | Rate of reaction with malate
(mM) (umol/L/sec) (umol/L/sec)
2 80 40
8 200 120
16 280 200
64 400 400
128 400 400

Which of the following is the most accurate statement about malate in this experiment?

©) A. It alters the maximal velocity of the reaction
