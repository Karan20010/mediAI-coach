(Choice A) Alanine transaminase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from alanine to a-
- 4
5 ketoglutarate, generating pyruvate that can be used for gluconeogenesis.
7 (Choice B) Aspartate is a nonessential amino acid; it can be converted into oxaloacetate for
8 use in the TCA cycle by aspartate transaminase.
9

(Choice C) Glutamate is deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase to form the TCA cycle
intermediate a-ketoglutarate.

(Choice D) Lysine and leucine are essential amino acids that are strictly ketogenic. They are
metabolized into acetyl-CoA, which is a precursor for ketone bodies.

(Choice E) Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase.
Tyrosine is further converted into fumarate (TCA cycle intermediate) and acetoacetate (ketone
body).

Educational objective:

Propionyl-CoA is derived from the metabolism of valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and
odd-chain fatty acids. Congenital deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase, the enzyme
responsible for the conversion of propionyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, leads to the
development of propionic acidemia. The condition presents with lethargy, poor feeding,
