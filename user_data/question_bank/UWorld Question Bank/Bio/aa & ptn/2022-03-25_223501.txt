3 residues severely diminishes the amount of collagen secreted by fibroblasts and impairs triple
: helix stability and covalent crosslink formation.
: (Choices A and B) After formation of the triple helix, procollagen molecules are secreted from
8 the cell via the Golgi apparatus. Propeptides at the N- and C-terminals are cleaved by
= extracellular procollagen peptidase to form insoluble tropocollagen molecules. These
a monomers then self-assemble into collagen fibrils that are subsequently crosslinked via lysyl
Qe oxidase.
. : (Choices C and D) Lysosomes and mitochondria are not directly involved in the synthesis of
collagen.

Educational objective:

The hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues in collagen helps it attain its maximum tensile
strength. This process occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and requires vitamin C as a
cofactor. Impaired collagen synthesis resulting from vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) can lead to
fragile vessels, predisposing to gingival bleeding, ecchymosis, and petechia.
