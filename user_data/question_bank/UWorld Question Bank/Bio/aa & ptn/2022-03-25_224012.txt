The extracellular matrix is a network of interstitial proteins that maintain normal tissue
architecture. Collagen is a major component of connective tissue and consists of 3
polypeptide a chains held together by hydrogen bonds to form a ropelike triple helix structure
(tropocollagen). Lysyl oxidase then forms covalent bonds between individual tropocollagen
molecules, generating mature collagen fibers. The variation in amino acid sequences in the
collagen a chains gives rise to collagen diversity in different tissues. Collagen types I, Il, Ill,
and V provide tensile strength in skin, bones, cartilage, tendons, and blood vessels.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders involving a defect in
collagen synthesis. EDS usually manifests clinically as hypermobile joints, overelastic skin,
and fragile tissue susceptible to bruising, wounds, and hemarthrosis. Common mutations
leading to EDS phenotypes include deficiencies of the lysyl hydroxylase and procollagen
peptidase enzymes responsible for collagen synthesis.
