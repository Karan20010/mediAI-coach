detection (newborn screening) and restriction of phenylalanine intake.

(Choice A) Cystinuria is due to impaired transport of renal cystine (a homodimer of cysteine),

which leads to cystine renal stone formation. Clinical manifestations typically include flank

pain, hematuria, and possible stone passage in children or adolescents.

(Choices B, C, and F) The branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine) are
elevated in maple syrup urine disease, an amino acid disorder marked by deficiency of
branched-chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex. Buildup of the branched-chain
amino acids and their metabolites is toxic, leading to feeding difficulties, seizures, cerebral

edema, and a sweet odor of the urine.

(Choice D) Phenylalanine levels are significantly elevated in PKU, leading to neurologic
defects. Therapy depends on dietary restriction of phenylalanine.

Educational objective:

Phenylketonuria (PKU) results from an inability to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine by the
phenylalanine hydroxylase system, making tyrosine an essential amino acid in these patients.
Classic clinical features of untreated PKU include intellectual disability, seizures, light

pigmentation, and a "musty" odor.
