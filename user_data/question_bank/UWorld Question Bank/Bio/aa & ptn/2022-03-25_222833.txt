The Michaelis-Menten model describes the behavior of enzyme-driven reactions by comparing
the rate of reaction (V) to the concentration of the substrate (S). Maximal velocity (Vina)
represents the speed at which the reaction occurs when the enzyme's active sites are
completely saturated with substrate. The Michaelis constant (K,,) defines the substrate
concentration at which half of the enzyme's binding sites are occupied by substrate (72 Vina).

Substrates with high affinity for the enzyme typically have a low K,,.

Competitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor binds to an enzyme and prevents it from
binding the substrate. Most competitive inhibitors (including malate) bind at the active site
(substrate-binding pocket) and physically impede substrate binding. Because these inhibitors
compete with the substrate for binding to the active site, additional substrate is required to
reach % V,,.., thereby increasing apparent K,. Competitive inhibitors have no effect on

enzyme function, and therefore V,,.. is unchanged.

In this example, V,,x. remains constant (at 400 umol/L/sec) while K,, increases (from 8 to 16

mM) in the presence of malate. Therefore, malate is a competitive inhibitor of succinate
dehydrogenase for succinate.
