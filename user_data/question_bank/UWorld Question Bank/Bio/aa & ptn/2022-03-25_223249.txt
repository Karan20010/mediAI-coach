Elevated levels of plasma homocysteine are an independent risk factor for thrombotic
events, including venous thromboses, coronary artery disease, and ischemic stroke. The
mechanism is thought to be due to direct and indirect induction of endothelial damage.

Homocysteine can be metabolized to methionine via remethylation or to cystathionine via
transsulfuration. Remethylation to methionine occurs with the donation of a methyl group from
methyl-tetrahydrofolate via methionine synthase, with vitamin B,, (cobalamin) as an important
cofactor. Methyl-tetrahydrofolate is regenerated by the enzyme methylene tetrahydrofolate
reductase (MTHFR), using FAD as a cofactor. Homocysteine can also undergo
transsulfuration via cystathionine-B-synthase to cystathionine (Choice A) and subsequently to
cysteine (Choice B) via the enzyme cystathionase, using vitamin Bg as a cofactor.

Elevations in plasma homocysteine can occur due to genetic mutations in critical enzymes and
vitamin (cofactor) deficiencies. MTHFR deficiency is the most common genetic cause of
hyperhomocysteinemia. Low levels of the B vitamins cobalamin, pyridoxine, and folate are
associated with hyperhomocysteinemia. However, supplementation of B vitamins for patients
with mildly to moderately elevated homocysteine levels has not demonstrated a decrease in
cardiovascular risk or mortality.
