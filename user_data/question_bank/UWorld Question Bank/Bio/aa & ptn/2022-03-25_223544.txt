This child likely has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a group of rare hereditary disorders
characterized by defective collagen synthesis. The condition can be caused by a
deficiency in procollagen peptidase, the enzyme that cleaves terminal propeptides from
procollagen in the extracellular space. Impaired propeptide removal results in the formation of
soluble collagen that does not properly crosslink. Consequently, patients often have joint
laxity, hyperextensible skin, fragile tissue with easy bruising, and poor wound healing.

Each collagen molecule consists of 3 polypeptide a-chains held together by hydrogen bonds,
forming a triple helix. Collagen assumes this conformation because each of the a-chains has
a simple, repetitive amino acid sequence represented as (Gly-X-Y),. The smallest amino acid,
glycine (Gly), is necessary at every third position to ensure compact coiling of the helix. Many
of the amino acids represented by X and Y are proline residues, which kink the polypeptide
chain and enhance the rigidity of the helical structure due to their ring configuration.
