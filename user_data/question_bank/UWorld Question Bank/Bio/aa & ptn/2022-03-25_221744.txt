3

4 (Choice A) 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG CoA) lyase is a mitochondrial enzyme

° necessary for ketogenesis. It is also responsible for metabolism of the ketogenic amino acid,

6

7 leucine.

8

9 (Choice B) Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the combination of ornithine and carbamoyl

10 phosphate to form citrulline in the urea cycle. This reaction occurs within the mitochondria.

i1

iB (Choice C) Pyruvate carboxylase catalyzes the initial step in gluconeogenesis by converting

= pyruvate to oxaloacetate. This enzyme requires biotin as a cofactor, and functions within the

1s mitochondria.

16

v7 (Choice D) Succinate dehydrogenase is a TCA cycle enzyme that converts succinate to

fumarate. It is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein and functions as part of the electron

+ 20 transport chain.

Educational objective:

Cellular compartmentalization allows multiple biochemical processes to occur simultaneously
at maximum efficiency. Beta-oxidation of fatty acids, the TCA cycle, and the carboxylation of
pyruvate (gluconeogenesis) all occur within the mitochondria. The enzymes responsible for
glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway reside in the cytosol.
