(Choice A) V,... depends on how fast an enzyme can catalyze a reaction when there are
enough substrate molecules to fully saturate its active sites. Competitive inhibitors do not
affect V..«, as higher substrate concentrations are able to overcome the inhibition.

(Choice B) Most competitive inhibitors, such as malate, bind in the substrate-binding pocket.
In contrast, most noncompetitive inhibitors bind at allosteric sites, resulting in a conformational
change of the enzyme that decreases enzymatic activity and slows the rate of reaction (Vinx).
Noncompetitive inhibition does not change the apparent K,, and cannot be overcome with
higher substrate concentrations.

(Choice C) Irreversible inhibitors bind to enzymes through strong covalent bonds; this
typically renders the enzyme permanently ineffective, decreasing the V,,a..

(Choice D) Competitive inhibitors interfere with substrate binding due to the inhibitor's own
high affinity for the enzyme's active site. This causes the measured K,, value to increase;
however, the actual enzyme affinity for the substrate remains unchanged.

Educational objective:

Competitive inhibitors compete with substrate for active binding sites on enzymes. Additional
substrate is required to achieve the same rate of reaction, increasing the measured value of
