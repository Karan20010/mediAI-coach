The amino acid methionine can be metabolized into S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), which acts
as a methyl-donor for many methyltransferase reactions. After the transfer of a methyl group,
SAM is converted into S-adenosyl-homocysteine, which is broken down to form adenosine and
homocysteine. Subsequently, the conversion of homocysteine to cystathionine requires the
enzyme cystathionine synthase, the amino acid serine, and the cofactor vitamin B,.
Cystathionine is then converted to cysteine by the enzyme cystathionase, which also requires
vitamin B, as a cofactor. Alternatively, the enzyme methionine synthase uses vitamin B,. as a

cofactor to revert homocysteine back to methionine.

This patient most likely has homocystinuria, a condition that leads to hypercoagulability and
thromboembolic occlusion. Because homocysteine is prothrombotic, individuals with
complete cystathionine synthase deficiency can develop premature acute coronary syndrome,
as seen in this patient (based on his troponin level and ECG findings). Other clinical features
include ectopia lentis (ocular lens displacement) and intellectual disability.

The most common cause of homocystinuria is a defect in cystathionine synthase. Affected
patients cannot form cysteine from homocysteine; therefore, cysteine is essential in their diet.
In addition, homocysteine buildup results in hypermethioninemia, as seen in this patient.
