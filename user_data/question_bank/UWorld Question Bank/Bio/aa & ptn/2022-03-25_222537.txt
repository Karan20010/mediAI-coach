Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and is synthesized by fibroblasts,
osteoblasts, and chondroblasts. It consists of 3 polypeptide alpha chains held together by
hydrogen bonds, forming a rope-like triple helix (collagen molecule). Collagen molecules
self-assemble into fibrils, which subsequently crosslink to form collagen fibers.

The triple helical conformation of collagen molecules occurs due to the simple and repetitive
amino acid sequence within each alpha chain, in which glycine (Gly) occupies every third
amino acid position (Gly-X-Y). Glycine is the most abundant amino acid in collagen and, due
to its small size, is the only amino acid that can fit into the confined space between individual

alpha chains.
