A 2-year-old boy is evaluated for easy bruising. His parents report that he develops marked
bruising and open wounds following minor trauma. The skin is difficult to suture due to its
extreme fragility. Physical examination reveals hyperextensible skin, multiple ecchymoses
over the forearms and pretibial regions, and an umbilical hernia. A skin biopsy is performed,
and histochemical evaluation of the biopsy reveals a defect in extracellular processing of
collagen. Which of the following steps of collagen synthesis is most likely impaired in this
patient?

A. Glycosylation of hydroxylysine residues (10%)

B. Interchain C-terminal disulfide bond formation (18%)

SY C. N-terminal propeptide removal (23%)
