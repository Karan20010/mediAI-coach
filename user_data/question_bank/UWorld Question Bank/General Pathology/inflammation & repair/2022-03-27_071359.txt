The cellular immune response to a viral pathogen (eg, influenza) requires the presentation of
viral antigens to effector immune cells (eg, CD8- lymphocytes). The ubiquitin proteasome
pathway (UPP) is essential to this process because of its role in breaking down native and
foreign intracellular proteins. Ubiquitin ligase initiates the UPP by recognizing specific protein
substrates and catalyzing the attachment of ubiquitin. The proteins tagged with ubiquitin are
then broken down by a proteasome to peptide fragments which can be recycled into amino
acids.

The peptide fragments produced during this process can also be coupled to major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class | molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and then
presented on the cell surface. Cytotoxic CD8- lymphocytes recognize nonnative (eg, viral)
proteins on infected cells and trigger apoptosis of the cell by activating the caspase cascade
through the release perforin and granzyme (Choice B).

(Choice A) Acid phosphatase is found in the lysosome of most cells and hydrolyzes organic
phosphates, but it is not involved in antigen presentation.

(Choice C) Guanylate cyclase is involved in the G-protein signaling cascade, which plays a
crucial role in the activation and regulation of diverse physiologic processes (eg, smooth
