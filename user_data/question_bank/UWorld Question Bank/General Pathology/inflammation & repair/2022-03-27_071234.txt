(Choice A) Bradykinin is a component of the kinin system. It is a short-lived peptide that
causes vasodilation, increases vascular permeability, stimulates endothelial smooth muscle
dilation, and mediates pain.

(Choice B) Erythropoietin is a growth factor for erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow. It
is produced by peritubular cells of the kidneys in response to hypoxia.

(Choice D) Leukotriene B, is a metabolite of arachidonic acid. Its main function is to stimulate
neutrophil migration to the site of inflammation.

(Choice E) Platelet-activating factor is released by endothelium, platelets, and immune cells,

and is involved in leukocyte function (eg, endothelium attachment, phagocytosis,
degranulation), platelet stimulation, and changes to vascular tone and permeability.

(Choice F) Thromboxane A, is one of the products of the cyclooxygenase pathway. It is
synthesized by platelets and causes platelet activation and aggregation. It does not cause
erythrocyte aggregation or rouleaux formation.

Educational objective:
Chronic inflammation is associated with increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg,
IL-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha), which stimulates the liver to release acute-phase
