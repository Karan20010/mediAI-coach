(Choice D) Myeloperoxidase is a key component of the respiratory burst of neutrophils and is
released into the phagocytic vacuole and extracellular space as part of the immune response
to bacteria and other pathogens.

Educational objective:

An essential step in the activation of the cellular immune response to a virus is the breakdown
of intracellular viral proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. This pathway is initiated by
ubiquitin ligases, which recognize specific protein substrates and attach a ubiquitin tag. The
target proteins are then degraded by a proteasome into peptide fragments, which are coupled
with major histocompatibility complex class | proteins and presented on the cell surface for
surveillance by cytotoxic CD8- lymphocytes.
