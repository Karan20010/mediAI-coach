Acute wounds, such as the sharp laceration this patient sustained from a knife, transition

through an organized healing process to restore continuity and tensile strength. This process

involves activation and recruitment of different cell types during 4 sequential (but overlapping)

phases: hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and maturation.

Hemostasis, which occurs immediately after tissue injury, involves small vessel constriction,
platelet aggregation, and clotting cascade activation that leads to platelet plugging, fibrin clot
formation, and cessation of bleeding. For relatively minor injuries, hemostasis is often
accomplished within minutes. The fibrin clot that is formed during this phase provides a
scaffold for subsequent wound healing.

Inflammation usually starts within hours of injury. During this phase, mast cells degranulate,
releasing histamine and other chemical mediators that increase vascular permeability and
promote cellular infiltration (eg, neutrophils, monocytes). Neutrophils digest bacteria,
necrotic tissue, and foreign debris. Monocytes are transformed into macrophages, which
secrete growth factors (eg, transforming growth factor-beta, vascular endothelial growth factor)
that promote the next phase of healing.

Proliferation, which begins during the inflammatory phase and continues for weeks afterward,

leads to replacement of injured or missing tissue via the following:
