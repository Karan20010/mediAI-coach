In the gastrointestinal tract, these changes result in progressive inflammation, edema, and
mucosal denudation that decrease the absorptive area. Abdominal pain and diarrhea

EEE typically manifest several weeks after radiotherapy is started. In some cases, the effects of

radiation exposure can be delayed until years after radiation exposure and present as
complications of intestinal fibrosis (eg, strictures, adhesions, bowel obstruction).

(Choice B) The ubiquitin-proteasome system has an integral role in maintaining normal cell
function by degrading damaged proteins and contributing to cell cycle control. Although
proteasome activity normally increases in response to oxidative stress, this system is inhibited
by ionizing radiation, potentiating the apoptotic effects of radiotherapy.

(Choices C, D, and E) Many chemotherapeutic agents impair essential steps in the DNA and
cellular repair processes and can potentiate the effects of ionizing radiation. Although
inhibition of DNA polymerase (eg, nucleoside analogues), inhibition of thymidylate synthesis:
(eg, 5-fluorouracil), and prevention of microtubule assembly (eg, vinblastine) would contribute
to the cytotoxic effects of radiation, radiation-induced tissue damage occurs primarily through
the generation of free radicals.

Educational objective:
lonizing radiation causes cellular and DNA damage primarily through generation of reactive
