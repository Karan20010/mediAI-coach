(Choice A) Caseous necrosis is a pattern of necrosis seen with mycobacterial or certain
fungal (eg, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus) infections. Collections of epithelioid macrophages and
giant cells surround white, friable, cheese-like material made up of cell fragments and
proteinaceous debris (ie, caseating granulomas).

(Choice C) Fat necrosis occurs in areas with high numbers of adipocytes (eg, pancreas,
breast, subcutaneous fat) and is frequently seen in pancreatitis. Enzymes released from
damaged cells break down triglycerides into free fatty acids, which combine with calcium to
form soaps; anucleated adipocytes with calcium deposits are visible on microscopy.

(Choice D) Fibrinoid necrosis is a histologic pattern of injury seen in the walls of blood
vessels affected by vasculitis or malignant hypertension. It results from immune complexes
and/or plasma proteins (eg, fibrin) leaking through the damaged intima and depositing within
the vessel wall; the deposits appear histologically as a circumferential ring of pink, amorphous
material surrounding the vascular lumen.

(Choice F) Dystrophic calcification occurs in areas of tissue injury or necrosis that escape
removal by phagocytes. Phosphate ions in the necrotic tissue bind calcium to form salts,
which can appear grossly as white granules and microscopically as amorphous, basophilic

material on hematoxylin and eosin stain. However, the calcification develops slowly over the
Block Time Elapse
