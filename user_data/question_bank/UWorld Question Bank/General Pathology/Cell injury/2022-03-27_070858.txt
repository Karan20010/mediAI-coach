This patient who has a 50-pack-year smoking history and a mediastinal mass likely has
muscle atrophy due to cancer-related cachexia. Cachexia is a hypermetabolic state driven by
elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6), which
stimulate the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to degrade skeletal muscle proteins (eg, actin,
myosin).

The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is the major eukaryotic mechanism for selective
proteolysis (the destruction of targeted proteins). The addition of ubiquitin multimers to a
target protein marks it for rapid destruction by the proteasome, whereby the protein is
unfolded within the proteasome core and chopped into small oligopeptides. These
oligopeptides can be further degraded by cytosolic peptidases into individual amino acids.

Other proteolytic pathways play a less prominent role in the degradation of muscle tissue.
Lysosomes, membrane-bound organelles that contain proteases and other digestive enzymes,
are primarily tasked with breaking down extracellular components that are brought into the cell
via endocytosis and with slowly recycling obsolete cytosolic organelles and debris.

(Choice B) Necrosis is characterized by cellular injury and premature death due to external
factors such as infection, toxin, or trauma. It is often characterized by irreparable damage to

the cellular membrane with subsequent leakage of cellular contents.
