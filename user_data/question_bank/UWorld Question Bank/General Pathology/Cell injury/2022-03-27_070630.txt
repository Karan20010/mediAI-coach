(Choice F) Dystrophic calcification occurs in areas of tissue injury or necrosis that escape
removal by phagocytes. Phosphate ions in the necrotic tissue bind calcium to form salts,
which can appear grossly as white granules and microscopically as amorphous, basophilic
material on hematoxylin and eosin stain. However, the calcification develops slowly over the
months and years following the initial injury.

Educational objective:

Lethal tissue ischemia causes coagulative necrosis in most tissues (eg, kidney, myocardium);
cellular architecture is maintained but nuclei are absent. The exception is ischemic cell death
in the CNS, which causes liquefactive necrosis.
