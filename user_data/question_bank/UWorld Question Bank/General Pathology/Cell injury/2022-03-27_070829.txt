(Choice A) Hemosiderin accumulation is common in patients who have hemolytic anemia or

ni

who undergo frequent blood transfusions. It is not associated with apoptosis.

(Choice B) The extrinsic pathway requires engagement of death receptors on the cell surface.
These death receptors are in the tumor necrosis factor receptor family, with the type 1 TNF
receptor (TNFR1) and a related protein named Fas (CD95) the two best known members of
this family. After cross-linkage of Fas with its ligand, multiple molecules of Fas come together
to form a binding site for a death-domain containing adapter protein called FADD. FADD then
binds an inactive form of a caspase, again bringing multiple caspase proteins together that
through a cascade effect eventually induce caspase activation.

(Choice D) Succinate dehydrogenase is a mitochondrial enzyme in the electron transport
chain that acts by oxidizing succinate into fumarate and reducing FAD to FADH,. This enzyme

is not involved in apoptosis.

(Choice E) Superoxide dismutase catalyzes the reduction of superoxide anions to hydrogen
peroxide. This enzyme is not involved in apoptosis.

(Choice F) Lipoxygenase plays a key role in the synthesis of leukotrienes, a class of

inflammatory mediators. ctivate V
