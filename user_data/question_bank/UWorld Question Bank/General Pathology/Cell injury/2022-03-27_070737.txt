digest necrotic tissue

CSF = cerebrospinal fluid.

This patient's symptoms are consistent with an ischemic stroke involving the left middle
cerebral artery territory. An embolism is the most likely cause given his history of atrial
fibrillation in the absence of anticoagulation therapy. The resulting irreversible neural cell
injury initiates immune cell migration and hydrolytic enzyme release, leading to necrosis of
damaged neural tissue. Although ischemic cell death in most organs results in coagulative
necrosis, in the brain such injury causes liquefactive necrosis within 10 days of the infarction
due to the brain's lack of supporting architecture.

The infarcted CNS tissue is then digested by microglia and replaced with a cystic space
surrounded by a dense astroglial scar (gliosis) over the ensuing months to years.

(Choice A) Fibrinoid necrosis is a pattern of injury that results in accumulation of fibrin-like
material in the walls of blood vessels affected by vasculitis syndromes (eg, polyarteritis
nodosa) or malignant hypertension. Although fibrinoid necrosis in cerebral arteries can
predispose a patient to hemorrhagic stroke, this change would not be an expected
complication of acute ischemic stroke.
