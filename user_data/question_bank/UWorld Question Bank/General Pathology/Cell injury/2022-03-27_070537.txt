Patterns of tissue necrosis

Type

Etiology

Morphology

Liquefactive
necrosis

¢ Severe bacterial infections
(eg, gangrene)
¢ CNS infarcts

¢ Necrotic tissue is digested by

hydrolytic enzymes into a viscous

fluid:

© Infected abscess fluid is creamy
yellow due to dead leukocytes
(pus)

© Brain infarcts resolve into CSF-
filled spaces

Fibrinoid

necrosis

¢ Hypertension
¢ Vasculitis

¢ Damaged vessels leak fibrin/immune
complexes

¢ Eosinophilic layer of proteinaceous
material in vessel walls
