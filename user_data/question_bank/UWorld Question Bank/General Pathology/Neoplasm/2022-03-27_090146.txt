months. He is a retired veteran and has not seen a doctor for many years. He has smoked a

and regular. Cardiopulmonary examination is unremarkable. The abdomen is soft and
nontender. There is focal tenderness over the 10th rib and L1-L2 vertebral region. Neurologic
examination is normal. Radionuclide bone imaging reveals increased activity in multiple
