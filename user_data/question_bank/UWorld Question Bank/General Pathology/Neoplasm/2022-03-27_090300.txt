Cytokeratins are proteins that form the intermediate filaments (IF s) in epithelial cells. IFs are
stable fibers that extend across the cell cytoplasm and connect to anchoring proteins (eg,
desmosomes, hemidesmosomes) in the plasma membrane, therefore supplying cells with
structural support to withstand mechanical forces.

The proteins that compose IFs vary based on tissue type. Detecting antigens that are specific
to certain tissues can help characterize the origin of neoplastic cells in undifferentiated tumors
(ie, anaplastic tumor cells that do not morphologically resemble their cell of origin). For this
reason, immunohistochemical stains targeting IF proteins are often used to classify
tumors. Positivity for cytokeratin stain suggests that a tumor has epithelial origin (eg,
carcinoma).

Other IF proteins that can be targeted to determine a tumor's cell of origin include the
following:

¢ Desmin: Muscle cell origin (Choice F)

¢ Glial fibrillary acidic protein: Glial origin

¢ Neurofilament: Neuronal origin

e Vimentin: Mesenchymal (eg, fibroblast) origin (Choice C)
