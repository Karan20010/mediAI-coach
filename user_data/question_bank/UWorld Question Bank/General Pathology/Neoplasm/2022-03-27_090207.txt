suppress osteoblasts and would cause osteolytic lesions, which are not present in this patient.
Patients commonly have bone pain, recurrent infections, and symptoms of anemia.

(Choice C) Elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP) levels can occur with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with symptoms of hypercalcemia
(confusion, abdominal pain, bony pain). Osteolytic bone lesions would be seen in NSCLC.

(Choice D) Lymphadenopathy and BCL-2 overexpression are found in lymphomas. BCL-2 is
an anti-apoptosis factor, and overexpression plays a role in resistance to chemotherapy.
Common manifestations of lymphoma also include night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue.

(Choice F) Arapidly enlarging irregular mole is suggestive of a melanoma. The liver, bone,
and brain are the most common metastatic sites. Melanoma causes lytic bone lesions.

Educational objective:

Imaging of bone metastases assists in cancer diagnosis. Bone metastases are characterized
as osteolytic or osteoblastic. Bony pain in an older man with osteoblastic lesions on imaging is
highly suspicious for prostate cancer.
