carcinomas. The p53 tumor suppressor gene regulates the cell cycle and promotes repair of
damaged DNA; mutations are found in most colon carcinomas but rarely adenomas.

(Choice D) Mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes such as MLH1 and MSH2 result in
microsatellite instability and an accumulation of genetic errors in many of the other genes
implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis. Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 cause hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) but are not frequently associated with
sporadic colorectal carcinoma.

Educational objective:

Mutation of the APC tumor suppressor gene is the first step in the classic adenoma-to-
carcinoma sequence; it is found in most cases of sporadic colon cancer and in all patients with
familial adenomatous polyposis. The microsatellite instability pathway is characterized by
mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes and is implicated in the development of hereditary
nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome).
