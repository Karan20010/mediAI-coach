protein that regulates the cell cycle by stimulating and inhibiting it as necessary. Mutation
of KRAS into its oncogene form leads to a constitutively activated GTP-bound protein.

3. Malignant transformation of adenoma into carcinoma. This step requires mutation of
TP53, a tumor suppressor gene that regulates the cell cycle and promotes repair of
damaged DNA; mutations are found in most colon carcinomas but rarely in adenomas
(Choice E).

(Choice A) Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BRCA are classically associated with
breast and ovarian cancers.

(Choice B) Cyclin D is a protein (encoded by CCND7) that regulates cell cycle. Its
overexpression is seen in breast, lung, and esophageal cancers and certain types of
lymphomas.

(Choice D) An increased number of copies (amplification) of the NMYC oncogene are seen in

neuroblastoma.

(Choice F) Mutation of W717, a tumor suppressor gene, leads to the development of Wilms
tumor.
