dermis with epidermal thickening (acanthosis) and prolonged downward thickenings between

dermal papillae ("rete ridges").

(Choice C) Irregular moles (eg, melanoma, atypical mole) are likely to contain dysplastic
cells. Dysplasia is characterized by abnormal epithelial cellular architecture and irregular
cellular growth. In metaplasia, one mature, differentiated cell type is replaced by another.
(Choice D) Hypertrophy is an increase in the size, but not number, of cells. Left ventricular
hypertrophy can occur with aortic stenosis due to higher systolic pressures necessitating
increased myocardial effort.

(Choice E) Atrophy is a reduction in cell size and number; it can occur in skeletal muscles
following a period of immobility (eg, bedbound patient).

Educational objective:

Metaplasia is the substitution of one differentiated cell type for another due to the presence of
an adverse environmental stimulus. It is often seen in the bronchi of chronic cigarette smokers
(substitution of ciliated columnar epithelium with stratified squamous cells) and the distal
esophagus of patients with chronic gastroesophageal reflux (substitution of stratified
squamous epithelium with intestinal columnar cells). Metaplasia can lead to subsequent

dysplasia and malignant transformation.
