The HER2 oncogene codes for a human epidermal growth factor receptor with tyrosine kinase
activity in the intracellular domain. It is known to play a role in the activation of transduction
pathways that control epithelial growth and differentiation. Epithelial cell carcinomas that
overexpress HER2 demonstrate increased proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.
Consequently, HER2-positive breast cancers have a higher risk of disease recurrence and
worse prognosis compared to HER2-negative breast cancers. Trastuzumab (a monoclonal
antibody against HER2) is used to treat women who test positive for overexpression of the

HER2 oncogene.

(Choice B) Estrogen and progesterone receptors are intracellular receptors that are
frequently overexpressed in patients with breast cancer. Stimulation of these hormone
receptors increases cellular proliferation, and patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast
cancer are treated with antiestrogen medications to suppress tumor growth.

(Choice C) Intercellular binding is mediated by cell surface proteins such as intercellular
adhesion molecules (ICAMs), selectins, and numerous others. Many adhesion proteins,
including ICAMS, also play a role in signal transduction.
