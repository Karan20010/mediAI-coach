Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) is part of a family of transcription factors that perform a
critical role in the immune response to infection and inflammation. In inflammatory cells, NF-
KB is normally present in a latent, inactive state bound to its inhibitor protein, IKB. As part of
the classical activation pathway, an extracellular signal, such as the binding of bacterial
antigens to a toll-like receptor, causes activation of IKB kinase. This results in ubiquitination
and subsequent destruction of IkKB with the release of free NF-KB. Once free, NF-KB enters
the nucleus and promotes the synthesis of a number of inflammatory proteins such as
cytokines, acute phase reactants, cell adhesion molecules, and leukocyte-related growth
factors. The inflammatory cascade is self-limiting as NF-KB also stimulates the transcription of
more IkB, ultimately rebinding the freed NF-KB.

(Choices A and E) Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is the principal protein that
stimulates the production and release of neutrophils from the bone marrow. Tumor necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) plays a major role in the response to infection by increasing neutrophil
chemotaxis and stimulating macrophage phagocytosis. Although NF-kB upregulates
transcription of G-CSF and TNF-a, IkB degradation is not directly involved in the activation of
these factors.

(Choice B) Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a tyrosine kinase involved in the signaling pathway for
