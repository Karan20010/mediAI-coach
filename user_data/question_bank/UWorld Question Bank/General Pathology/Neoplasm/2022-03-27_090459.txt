The bcr-ab/ translocation is the Philadelphia chromosome found in chronic myelogenous
leukemia.

(Choice B) The ras proto-oncogene codes a protein that participates in signal transduction
(MAP-kinase associated pathway). Over-expression of this gene leads to increased sensitivity
of cells to mitogenic stimuli. This mutation occurs in a large number of cancers.

(Choice C) The Erb-B2 gene encodes a protein with tyrosine kinase activity related to the
epidermal growth factor receptor. Over-expression of this proto-oncogene is associated with
breast and ovarian cancers.

(Choice E) Expression of the N-myc proto-oncogene is amplified in neuroblastoma.
