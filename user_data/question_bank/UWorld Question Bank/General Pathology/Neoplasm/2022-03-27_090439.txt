Cervical dysplasia is almost always due to underlying infection with oncogenic serotypes of
human papilloma virus (HPV). In infected cells, viral proteins (eg, E6, E7) bind to tumor-
suppressing host proteins (eg, p53) and result in their destruction by the proteasome. This
eliminates a crucial check on cellular growth and can lead to dysplasia.

(Choices A, B, C, D, and E) Abundant mitoses, disordered maturation, changes in cell
polarity, nuclear abnormalities, and pleomorphism can be seen in both dysplasia and invasive

carcinoma.

Educational objective:

Dysplasia is characterized by disruption of organized epithelial cell differentiation with marked
cellular pleomorphism. Although high-grade dysplasia (involving most or the entire epithelial
layer) often progresses to invasive cancer, low-grade dysplasia (involving a small portion of
epithelium) typically spontaneously regresses. Invasive cancer occurs when the abnormal
cells penetrate the basement membrane.
