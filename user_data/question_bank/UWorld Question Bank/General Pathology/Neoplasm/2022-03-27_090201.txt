This patient with sclerotic bony metastases most likely has prostate cancer. Imaging of bone

metastases assists in cancer diagnosis, as it allows the lesions to be characterized as:

¢ Osteolytic (lucent): Due to osteoclast stimulation, tend to represent aggressive cancer
¢ Osteoblastic (sclerotic): Due to osteoblasts, indicates a more indolent course

Metastatic prostate cancer commonly has osteoblastic (sclerotic) bone lesions. Bone pain
is a typical clinical presentation; other symptoms include cancer cachexia and urinary
symptoms (which are not always present). Prostate cancer is the most common non-skin
cancer in men, and African American men are at highest risk. An irregular prostate gland on
digital rectal examination is suggestive of the diagnosis, which is then confirmed by biopsy.
The prostate-specific antigen tumor marker is commonly elevated.

(Choice A) Hematuria and polycythemia (due to erythropoietin release) are suggestive of
renal cell cancer. Renal cell cancer bone metastases are commonly osteolytic.

(Choice B) Monoclonal immunoglobulin spikes are found in multiple myeloma. Myeloma cells
suppress osteoblasts and would cause osteolytic lesions, which are not present in this patient.
Patients commonly have bone pain, recurrent infections, and symptoms of anemia.

(Choice C) Elevated parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTH-rP) levels can occur with
