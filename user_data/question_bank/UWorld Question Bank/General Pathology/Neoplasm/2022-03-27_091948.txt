This patient's pale red reflex and well-circumscribed white mass within the retina are indicative
of retinoblastoma. Retinoblastoma is an intraocular tumor caused by inactivating mutations

affecting the RB7tumor suppressor gene with subsequent dysregulation of the cell cycle.
The cell cycle consists of the following stages:
¢ Gap phase 0 (GO phase) is a resting stage in which the cell cycle is suspended.
¢ Interphase is the stage in which the cell prepares for division. Interphase is subdivided
into the G1 phase (synthesis of RNA, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate), S phase (DNA
replication), and the G2 phase (ATP synthesis).
¢ Mitosis (M) is the stage in which the cell divides into two daughter cells.

Checkpoints occur at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, allowing the cell cycle to be stopped if
damaged DNA is detected by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. DNA repair mechanisms
are activated, but if the DNA damage is too substantial, the cell undergoes apoptosis.

The RB1 gene encodes the Rb protein that regulates the G1/S checkpoint. In its active form,
Rb protein binds and inhibits E2F transcription factors, thereby halting the cell cycle. In
contrast, when a cell is ready to divide, Rb protein is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent
kinases, allowing the cell to proceed through the G1/S checkpoint. Loss-of-function
