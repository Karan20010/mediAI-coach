Biopsy of this patient's painful skin nodule shows atypical keratinocytes within both the
epidermis and dermis. Extension into the dermis represents invasion past the basement
membrane, classifying this patient's lesion as an invasive skin cancer arising from the
epidermis (eg, squamous cell carcinoma [SCC}).

Further histopathologic examination can determine the tumor grade, which describes the
degree to which the neoplastic cells still resemble normal cells (ie, degree of differentiation),
thereby estimating their likely aggressiveness. Low-grade neoplasms typically contain well-
differentiated cells that maintain characteristics of normal, mature cells of their type (eg,
presence of keratinization or intercellular bridges in SCC). In contrast, high-grade neoplasms
contain cells that are poorly differentiated (ie, anaplastic), appearing distinctly abnormal under
the microscope (eg, pleomorphic cells with enlarged nuclei, scant cytoplasm, prominent
nucleoli, and lack of keratinization). In other tumor types, architectural features (eg, gland
formation in adenocarcinoma) or the number of mitotic figures may be part of the grading
criteria.

Tumor stage is a marker of degree of spread. Low stage is seen when the tumor remains
confined to the site of origin (eg, forearm skin); a higher stage is seen when there is regional
(eg, lymph node) or distant (eg, lung) spread. In this case, the absence of regional
