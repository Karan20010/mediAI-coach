Question Id: 12049

responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis.

(Choice C) p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell
cycle control; mutations or deletions are present in a large percentage of human tumors.

(Choice D) Platelet-derived growth factor stimulates formation of new blood vessels and
proliferation of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells by binding to a receptor tyrosine kinase;
mutations resulting in overexpression encourage tumor growth by promoting uncontrolled
angiogenesis.

(Choice E) Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the dominant growth factor involved
in angiogenesis and lymph vessel development. Overexpression of VEGF promotes tumor
vascularization, facilitating the growth and metastasis of cancers.

Educational objective:

Activating mutations of the KRAS gene lead to constitutive activation of the epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) pathway, promoting increased cell proliferation and growth. Tumors
harboring these mutations are resistant to treatment with anti-EGFR drugs (eg, cetuximab,

panitumumab).
