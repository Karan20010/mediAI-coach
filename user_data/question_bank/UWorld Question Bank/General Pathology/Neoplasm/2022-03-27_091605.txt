Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is stimulated in a paracrine or autocrine fashion
by its ligands, leading to the downstream activation of KRAS, a membrane-bound GTP-
binding protein that stimulates cellular growth and proliferation. Many cancers (eg,
colorectal, pancreas) leverage this system to drive unchecked cellular growth by
overexpressing EGFR and its ligands or by developing constitutive activating mutations in the

KRAS proto-oncogene.

The EGFR signaling system can be targeted for cancer treatment through the use of
monoclonal antibodies (eg, cetuximab, panitumumab) that block EGFR, leading to reduced
KRAS stimulation and decreased cellular growth. However, this treatment is only effective
for tumors with wild-type (normal) KRAS. Tumors with KRAS-activating mutations are
resistant to anti-EGFR agents as they have a constitutive activation of a downstream signal
that is independent of EGFR stimulation or blockade. Prior to the use of anti-EGFR agents,
genetic testing of tumor tissue is performed to see if KRAS is wild-type (eligible for treatment)
or mutated (noneligible).

(Choice A) Adenomatous polyposis coli is a tumor suppressor protein that helps degrade
beta-catenin, preventing uncontrolled cell growth. Inherited inactivating gene mutations are

responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis.
