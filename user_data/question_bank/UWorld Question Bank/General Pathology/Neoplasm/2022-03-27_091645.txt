The esophagus is normally lined by nonkeratinized, stratified squamous epithelium. However,
chronic exposure to acidic stomach contents can damage the epithelial surface and result in
the release of cytokines and growth factors that cause esophageal stem cells to differentiate
into an alternate epithelial cell type (intestine-like columnar cells) better suited for an acidic
environment. The substitution of one differentiated epithelial cell type for another in response

to adverse environmental conditions is called metaplasia.

Metaplasia is also seen in the trachea and bronchi of chronic cigarette smokers where the
irritative effect of smoke leads to the replacement of normal ciliated columnar cells with
heartier stratified squamous epithelium. Although this substitution reduces epithelial injury, it
also eliminates the cell types that contain cilia and produce mucus, which increases the risk of

respiratory infection.

Metaplasia is a reversible condition, but continued environmental stress can lead to malignant
transformation (metaplasia — dysplasia — invasive cancer). For instance, the metaplasia
seen in the distal esophagus in response to chronic acid exposure (Barrett esophagus) is
associated with a high risk of malignant transformation into esophageal adenocarcinoma.

(Choice B) Psoriasis is characterized by hyperplasia, an increase in the number of cells
within a tissue due to hormones or growth factors. Histology will show hyperproliferation of the
