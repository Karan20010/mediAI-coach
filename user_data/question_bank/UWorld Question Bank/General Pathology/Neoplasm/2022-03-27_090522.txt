Most colon adenocarcinomas develop from preexisting adenomatous polyps (adenomas).
Colon adenomas usually occur in patients in their 50s and 60s and are considered
premalignant. On average, 10 years are required for malignant transformation of adenoma;
therefore, early detection and excision of adenomatous polyps can help prevent colon
adenocarcinoma. Features that impact the malignant potential of adenomatous polyps include
size (<1 cm, unlikely to undergo malignant transformation; >4 cm, 40% risk of malignancy),
histologic appearance (villous more prone to malignant transformation than tubular), and
degree of dysplasia.

Transformation of normal mucosal cells into malignant ones is caused by a series of gene
mutations called the adenoma to carcinoma sequence:

1. Progression from normal mucosa to a small adenomatous polyp (adenoma). The
initial appearance of small adenomatous polyps is attributed to mutation of the APC tumor
suppressor gene.

2. Increase in the size of the adenoma. Mutation of the KRAS protooncogene is thought to
facilitate this step (going from a small early to a large late adenoma, as with this patient) by
leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Normally, KRAS encodes for a G protein-like
protein that regulates the cell cycle by stimulating and inhibiting it as necessary. Mutation
