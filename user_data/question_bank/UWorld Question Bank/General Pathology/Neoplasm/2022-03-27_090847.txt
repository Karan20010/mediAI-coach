Well differentiated (low-grade) tumors contain neoplastic cells that are morphologically and
architecturally similar to normal cells in the tissue of origin. In contrast, poorly differentiated
(high-grade) tumors contain neoplastic cells that lack most of the characteristic features of the
original tissue. Neoplasms that contain cells in the midst of this spectrum are termed
moderately differentiated (medium-grade). Neoplastic cells that demonstrate a complete lack

of differentiation are termed anaplastic.
Anaplastic tumors typically demonstrate the following features:

1. Loss of cell polarity with complete disruption of normal tissue architecture; cells coalesce
into sheets or islands in a disorganized, infiltrative fashion (example, compare to normal)

2. Significant variation in the shape and size of cells (cellular pleomorphism) and nuclei
(nuclear pleomorphism)

3. Disproportionately large nuclei (high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio) that are often deep-
staining (hyperchromatic) with abundant, coarsely-clumped chromatin and large nucleoli
(example)

4. Numerous, often abnormal, mitotic figures

5. Giant, multinucleated tumor cells(Choice A)
