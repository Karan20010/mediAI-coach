Educational objective:

Dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase are enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, which
occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle. The Rb protein, in its active (dephosphorylated)
form, regulates cell cycle progression by preventing the transition from the G1 phase to the S
phase. Phosphorylation of the Rb protein inactivates it, allowing cells to progress through the
G1/S checkpoint and proliferate.
