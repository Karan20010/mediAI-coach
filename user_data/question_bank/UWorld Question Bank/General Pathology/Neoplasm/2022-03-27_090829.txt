(Choice B) Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is a tyrosine kinase involved in the signaling pathway for
myeloproliferation. Constituent activation of JAK2 is associated with polycythemia vera,
essential thrombocytosis, and myelofibrosis. It does not play a major role in the immune
response to infection.

(Choice D) Although transforming growth factor-8 (TGF-B) also has a role in the immune
response and is triggered by inflammatory pathways, it is complexed to TGF-8 binding protein
and latency-associated peptide, not IkB.

Educational objective:

Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) is a transcription factor with a critical role in the immune
response to infection. NF-kB is normally present in the cytoplasm in a latent, inactive state
bound to its inhibitor protein, IKB. Extracellular substances such as lipopolysaccharide can
initiate a signal cascade that results in the destruction of IKB and translocation of free NF-kB to
the nucleus.
