This patient has a highly vascularized liver tumor, possibly a benign hepatic hemangioma.
Many cases are discovered incidentally. Angiogenesis (blood vessel formation) is
predominantly driven by the following 2 substances:

¢ Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF): VEGF stimulates angiogenesis in a variety
of tissues (normal, chronically inflamed, healing, or neoplastic). As VEGF increases
endothelial cell motility and proliferation, new capillaries begin to sprout.

Fibroblast growth factor (FGF): FGF-2 is produced by a wide range of cells and is
involved in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. FGF-2 also appears
to play an important role in embryogenesis by stimulating angioblast production. Asa

group, FGFs not only contribute to angiogenesis, but also to embryonic development,
hematopoiesis, and wound repair (by recruiting macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial
cells to damaged tissues).

However, the laminin in basement membranes may pose a physical barrier to the sprouting of

new blood vessels.

(Choice A) Epidermal growth factor (EGF), not to be confused with VEGF, has a mitogenic

influence on epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and fibroblasts. EGF does not appear to play as
