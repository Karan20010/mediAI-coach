enzymes (eg, metalloproteinases, cathepsin D protease)

(Choice A) Acid hydrolases, which function at acidic pH, are primarily degradative lysosomal
enzymes.

(Choice B) In humans, alkaline phosphatase is concentrated in liver cells; elevated levels
suggest an obstructive biliary process.

(Choice C) Carboxypeptidases cleave peptide bonds at the carboxy-terminal; some
participate in the synthesis of insulin and neuropeptides.

(Choice E) Hyaluronic acid is an ECM component.

Educational objective:

Metalloproteinases are zinc-containing enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix. They
participate in normal tissue remodeling and in tumor invasion through the basement
membrane and connective tissue.
