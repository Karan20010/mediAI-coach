The image above shows a tubular adenoma, a precursor of colorectal carcinoma. Tubular
adenomas are composed of tubular glands lined by dysplastic columnar epithelial cells,
which are characteristic of colonic adenomatous polyps. The malignant potential of an
adenomatous polyp is partly determined by the degree of dysplasia. Mildly dysplastic cells are
elongated and hyperchromatic and show loss of mucin from the cytoplasm. With continued
proliferation, dysplastic cells display increased variation in shape/size (pleomorphism) as well
as loss of polarity. Other findings include an increase in number/size of nucleoli, nuclear-to-

cytoplasmic ratio, and number of mitotic figures.

Most cases of sporadic colorectal carcinoma arise via the classic adenoma-to-carcinoma
sequence (APC/beta-catenin pathway). The first mutation in this pathway usually involves
the APC tumor suppressor gene, which is responsible for regulating cell growth/adhesion
(patients with familial adenomatous polyposis inherit an APC gene mutation and exhibit
tumorigenesis at an early age). Mutations in K-RAS, DCC (Deleted in Colon Cancer), and p53
occur later in the adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence (Choices B, C, and E). K-RAS proto-
oncogene and DCC gene mutations lead to unregulated cell proliferation and avoidance of
apoptosis, respectively. They are usually observed in larger adenomas (>1 cm) or
