Tumor cells are generally sequestered in the tissue of origin until they develop the following

adaptations:

1.

Loss of cell-cell adhesion: Normal epithelial cells tightly adhere to each other using
cadherin glycoproteins. Tumor cells down-regulate cadherin (eg, E-cadherin), which frees
individual cells to leave the site of origin (Choice D).

. Detachment from the basement membrane: Basal epithelial cells tightly adhere to the

basement membrane using integrin receptors, which anchor the basal end of the
cytoskeleton to external collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. This attachment helps maintain
cellular differentiation and limits excessive cellular growth. Tumor cells loosen their
attachment to the basement membrane by reducing the expression of integrin
receptors. Unlike normal epithelial cells, tumor cells can usually survive without cell-cell
or cell-basement membrane adhesion due to antiapoptotic genetic mutations.

Destruction of extracellular matrix: The basement membrane serves as a mechanical
barrier that separates tumor cells from blood vessels and lymphatics in the interstitial
matrix. In order to penetrate the basement membrane, tumor cells increase production of
type IV collagenases such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP). They also usually limit
the release of MMP inhibitors, which further amplifies basement membrane degradation
