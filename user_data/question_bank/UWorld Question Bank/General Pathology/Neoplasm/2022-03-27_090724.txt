(Choice A) Caspases are cysteine proteases, enzymes essential for apoptosis. Caspases
are not associated with the G1/S transition in the cell cycle.

(Choice B) Ras protein is a component of the MAP-kinase signal transduction system. It
transmits growth signals from cell surface receptors into the nucleus, leading to the
transcription of cyclin D complexes. Although involved in cell cycle progression, Ras protein
signaling would occur before phosphorylation of RB protein and would not immediately
precede the S phase.

(Choice C) The p27 protein is a cell cycle inhibitor. It acts during the G1 phase by inhibiting
cyclin-dependent kinases. Normal tissues (composed primarily of differentiated cells) contain
high levels of p27, and malignant tissues contain very low levels of p27. Upregulation of p27
would stop the cell cycle.

(Choice D) Protein kinase A is a component of the cAMP signaling system. It is not
associated with the G1/S transition in the cell cycle.
