as a stimulus for tumor growth. Therefore, anti-estrogen therapy (eg, aromatase inhibitors,
tamoxifen) is used to treat hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

(Choice D) Overexpression of a mutated form of p53 is found in many human cancers,
including breast cancers. However, the degree of protein expression does not correlate well
with clinical outcomes. Rather, the effects on prognosis are more dependent on the specific
mutation (eg, nonsense, gain of function).

Educational objective:

Estrogen- or progesterone-receptor positivity in breast cancer indicates expected sensitivity to
tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor treatment. HER2 overexpression in breast cancer suggests
a more aggressive tumor that typically responds to therapy with the anti-HER2 monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab.
