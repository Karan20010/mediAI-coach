Decreased activity of a tumor suppressor gene would predispose to neoplasms. Of the
choices listed, p53 is the only tumor suppressor gene. In normal individuals, p53 regulates cell
proliferation. It acts during phase G1 of the cell cycle to detect abnormalities of the cellular
genome. If there is damaged DNA, p53 will prevent the cell from progressing to mitosis,

causing the cell to be arrested in the G1 phase. If the DNA can be repaired, the cell will
subsequently be allowed to divide, but if the damage is so severe that repair is impossible, the
cell will proceed instead to apoptosis. p53 is nicknamed "the molecular policeman" because of
its important role in guarding the integrity of genetic material.

(Choice A) The bcr-ab! fusion gene is a product of translocation of genetic material from
chromosome 9 to chromosome 22 [t(9;22)]. It codes for a protein with tyrosine kinase activity.
The bcr-ab/ translocation is the Philadelphia chromosome found in chronic myelogenous
leukemia.

(Choice B) The ras proto-oncogene codes a protein that participates in signal transduction
(MAP-kinase associated pathway). Over-expression of this gene leads to increased sensitivity

of cells to mitogenic stimuli. This mutation occurs in a large number of cancers.

(Choice C) The Erb-B2 gene encodes a protein with tyrosine kinase activity related to the
