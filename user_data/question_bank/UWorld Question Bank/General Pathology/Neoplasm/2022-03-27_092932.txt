; This patient has medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) presenting with a palpable nodule and

° elevated serum calcitonin. MTC is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from calcitonin-

: secreting C (parafollicular) cells. Microscopy shows nests or sheets of polygonal or spindle-

8 shaped cells, often with extracellular amyloid deposition (consisting of full-length calcitonin).

= MTC is often seen in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (A and B), although the
a majority of cases are sporadic. Paraneoplastic symptoms (eg, diarrhea, flushing) can occur

. due to elevated calcitonin levels; however, calcium is usually normal, possibly due to the

. downregulation of calcitonin receptors.

15 MTC is associated with activating mutations in the RET proto-oncogene; mutations are

= commonly found in sporadic MTC, and germline mutations are present in more than 95% of

19 patients with familial MTC. The RET proto-oncogene codes for a membrane-bound tyrosine
* kinase receptor involved in cell cycle regulation. In patients with MTC, constitutive

. activation of the receptor leads to unregulated cellular proliferation.
