Cytokeratins are proteins that help form the keratin-containing intermediate filaments that
make up the cytoskeleton of almost all epithelial cells. Keratin proteins are highly abundant in
exposed stratified squamous epithelium such as the epidermis and oral mucosa and are less
abundant but still present in simple epithelium such as that found in the liver, gut, and
pancreas. As a result, cytokeratin is a commonly used immunohistochemical marker

for epithelial-derived tumors, such as breast cancer. Keratin is also the major protein

component of hair and nails.

Keratin is composed of large amounts of alanine and glycine that, because of their small
structure, are able to coil tightly and form large numbers of hydrogen bonds. In addition,
keratin contains a significant amount of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine, and
formation of disulfide bonds between cysteine residues gives additional rigidity and toughness
to the protein.

(Choice B) CD20 is a marker used to identify B lymphocytes, and CD3 is used to identify T

lymphocytes.

(Choice C) Vimentin is an intermediate filament present in mesenchymal tissue and can be

used to detect sarcomas. ctivate V
