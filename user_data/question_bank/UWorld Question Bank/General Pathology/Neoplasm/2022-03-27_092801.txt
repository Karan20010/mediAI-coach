Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the United States. Its incidence
increases with age, and it affects men and women equally. A diet high in fat and
carbohydrates and low in fiber increases the risk. Certain diseases (eg, inflammatory bowel
disease) and genetic factors also play an important role.

Most cases of sporadic colon adenocarcinoma arise from preexisting adenomatous polyps.
The transformation of normal mucosal cells into malignant ones is caused by a series of gene
mutations, the adenoma to carcinoma sequence:

1. Progression from normal mucosa to a small adenomatous polyp (adenoma). The
initial appearance of small adenomatous polyps is attributed to mutation of the APC tumor
suppressor gene. APC is located on chromosome 5, and its mutation leads to B-catenin
accumulation and uncontrolled cell proliferation.

2. Increase in the size of the adenoma. Mutation of the KRAS protooncogene is thought to
facilitate this step by leading to a protein that also stimulates unregulated cell growth.

3. Malignant transformation of adenoma into carcinoma requires mutation of TP53.

Sometimes called a "molecular policeman," TP53 is an antioncogene (tumor suppressor
gene) that codes for protein p53, which triggers apoptosis of cells with damaged DNA. A TP53
