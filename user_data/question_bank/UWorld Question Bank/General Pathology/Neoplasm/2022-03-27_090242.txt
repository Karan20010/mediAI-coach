4. Migration: Tumor cells secrete autocrine motility factors and express receptors for
stromal chemotactic factors. They also frequently increase the expression of non-integrin
laminin receptors at their leading end, which promotes propulsion through the extracellular
matrix (Choice A).

5. Dissemination: Tumor cells penetrate blood and lymph vessels using MMPs/proteases
and enter the vessel lumen. Because individual cancer cells are highly susceptible to
destruction by shearing forces and the adaptive/innate immune response, they typically
aggregate in clumps or attach to platelets and form emboli. They also express factors that
allow them to localize to specific sites; CD44, a localization receptor normally found on T
lymphocytes, is frequently expressed on tumor cells that disseminate to lymph nodes.

Educational objective:

Malignant cells undergo several changes to metastasize from the site of origin. They detach
from other cells by down-regulating cadherins and detach from the basement membrane by
down-regulating integrins. They secrete collagenases to create a path through the
extracellular matrix and then enter the bloodstream and/or lymphatic system to disseminate.
