A 21-year-old woman is hospitalized for elective subtotal colectomy with ileo-rectal
anastomosis due to abnormal colonoscopic findings. She underwent screening colonoscopy
because of family history of colon cancer. Her maternal grandfather died of metastatic colon
cancer, and her mother was also recently diagnosed with colon cancer. The patient has no
other medical problems, takes no medications, and does not use tobacco, alcohol, or illicit
drugs. The surgery is performed with no operative complications. Numerous lesions are
present throughout the resected colon, some of which are shown in the histopathology exhibit
below.
