¢ HPV viral protein E7 binds to retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which results in the
displacement of E2F (a transcription factor that induces cell cycle activation), promoting

unregulated DNA replication and cyclin-mediated cell cycling.

(Choices A and C) BRAF encodes for a serine/threonine—specific protein kinase involved in
regulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. It is often mutated in
melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and papillary thyroid cancer. RET encodes for a receptor
tyrosine kinase and is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, and
papillary thyroid cancer. Both RET and BRAF are protooncogenes that require gain-of-
function mutations to become oncogenes. Decreased activity can protect against uncontrolled
proliferation (eg, BRAF inhibitors used in melanoma).

(Choices D and E) BRCA7 and BRCA2 (associated with breast, ovarian, and pancreatic
cancers) encode a DNA repair protein. MEN7 (associated with MEN1) encodes for the protein
menin, which has diverse functions that may be related to regulation of cell cycle kinase
inhibitor and homeobox genes. Both BRCA1/2 and MEN 7 are tumor suppressor genes,
meaning that their inactivation (rather than overexpression) leads to tumor development.
