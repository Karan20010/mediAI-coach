(Choice A) RAS oncogene mutations lead to constitutively active growth signal transduction.
RAS mutations (particularly KRAS) are present in approximately 50% of sporadic colon
cancers. However, FAP is not caused by an initial mutation in RAS.

(Choice B) 7P53 acts as a transcriptional activator of genes that inhibit cellular growth. 7P53
mutations are the most common genetic abnormality seen in all cancers, and they are present
in approximately 75% of colorectal cancers. Germline mutation to TP53 is associated with Li
Fraumeni syndrome; these patients have increased risk of many tumor types but, for unclear
reasons, are not at particularly increased risk for colorectal cancer.

(Choice C) Lynch syndrome is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer due
to germline mutation to one of the DNA mismatch repair genes (eg, MSH2/6, MLH1). These
patients do not have extensive polyposis in the colon but are very likely to develop colon
cancer (from dysplasia in flat colonic mucosa).

(Choice D) Telomerase prevents the shortening of telomeres during cellular division, which
extends the life of the cell. Telomerase activity is increased in many cancer types but is not
especially linked to colorectal cancer.
