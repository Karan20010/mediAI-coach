Educational objective:

The size of adenomatous polyps determines their malignant potential. Adenomas <1 cm are
unlikely to undergo malignant transformation, whereas those >4 cm are very likely to progress
to adenocarcinoma. KRAS protooncogene mutation facilitates the growth of adenomas by
causing uncontrolled cell proliferation.
