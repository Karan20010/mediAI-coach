Autonomy supports a patient's right to know his or her diagnosis, treatment options, and
potential outcomes. However, personal preferences vary (eg, some patients may decline test
results or learning their diagnosis), and individual circumstances should guide disclosure.

In this scenario, the patient's preferences regarding her test results and diagnosis (eg,
glioblastoma multiforme), which has a poor prognosis, are unclear. Her son has privately
requested that the results not be shared with his mother. If family members ask to withhold
medical information from the patient, it is imperative for the physician to understand their
reasoning and concerns. The son may have a valid safety concern regarding disclosure of
bad news to his mother, who the physician knows has a history of depression and a prior
suicide attempt.

However, the physician should not make hasty assumptions about family circumstances, the
son's concerns, or the patient's state of mind. The most appropriate approach is to listen to
the family's concerns and better understand the situation before deciding how best to
proceed.

(Choice A) This statement supports patient autonomy. However, it does not allow the son to
clarify his concerns; instead, it takes a paternalistic tone (eg, "I think it's best"). It also hints at
a poor diagnosis (eg, "it will be difficult to hear"), which violates health privacy.
