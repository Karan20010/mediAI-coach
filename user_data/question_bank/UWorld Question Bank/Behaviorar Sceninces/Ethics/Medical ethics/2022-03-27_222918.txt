A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, comes to the emergency department for evaluation of
vaginal bleeding. The patient has had bright red spotting for the past 24 hours but no
contractions or leakage of fluid. She is at 31 weeks gestation by last menstrual period and has
not had prenatal care this pregnancy. Her first pregnancy ended in an uncomplicated
spontaneous vaginal delivery at term. Vital signs and fetal heart rate tracing are normal.
Physical examination shows a nontender uterus consistent in size with 31 weeks gestation. A
pelvic ultrasound reveals a complete placenta previa. The findings are discussed with the
patient, and she states that she would still like to have a vaginal delivery. The physician says,
"Unfortunately, the only safe option for delivery is a cesarean delivery." The physician's
statement is an example of which of the following ethical principles?

A. Assisted decision-making (12%)
Y/Y B. Directive counseling (53%)
C. Informed refusal (18%)

D. Shared decision-making (4%)
