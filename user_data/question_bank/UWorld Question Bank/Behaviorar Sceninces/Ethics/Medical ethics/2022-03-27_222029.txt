(Choice C) The patient's friend does not have priority over next of kin for decision-making. If
no family members are available, then the advice of his friend could be considered in
substituted judgment.

(Choice D) In an emergency, the physician should use clinical judgment and act promptly,
and can do so without consent if necessary. However, in this case, intubation is not emergent,

so an effort should be made to contact the patient's sister first.

(Choice E) Waiting for the patient's mental status to improve would be inappropriate, given
that his respiratory status may deteriorate rapidly.

Educational objective:

When a patient is unable to give consent for care and does not have a designated surrogate,
decision-making capacity falls to the next of kin, generally determined by the proximity of
relationship. In an emergency, the physician can treat an incapacitated patient without

obtaining consent.
