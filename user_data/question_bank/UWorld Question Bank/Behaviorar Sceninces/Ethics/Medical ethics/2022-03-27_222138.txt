(Choice C) The patient has already asserted that she does not have a sexually transmitted
illness, and further discussion on this point is likely to be perceived as condescending, which
could undermine trust. Treatment is recommended for all newborns, regardless of the
patient's history of being treated for an STI.

(Choice D) Although this statement makes a medically valid point, it blames the patient for a
worst outcome. Using parental fear and guilt as a coercive tactic should be avoided.

Educational objective:

The process of informed consent involves discussing the indications, risks, and benefits of
treatment. Assessing a patient's understanding of the discussion and responding to specific
concerns or confusion is essential to obtaining valid consent.
