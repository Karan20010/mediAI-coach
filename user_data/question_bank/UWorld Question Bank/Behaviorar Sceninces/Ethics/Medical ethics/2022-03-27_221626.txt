Voluntarily given informed consent is a prerequisite for proceeding with any nonemergency
medical treatment. In this case, informed consent was obtained 3 days prior, but the patient
now states that he does not want the surgery. Patients have the right to withdraw consent
at any time. When patients change their minds and refuse treatment, it is the physician's
responsibility to engage them in a new discussion of informed consent or informed refusal.
This patient has likely developed concerns about the procedure that were not discussed or
fully addressed in the initial informed consent process. The best approach is to ask him what
has changed and to explore his specific concerns related to the surgery in a nonjudgmental
fashion, without pressuring him to reconsent.

(Choice A) It would be inappropriate to medicate the patient without first assessing his
concerns. Sedative drugs have cognitive effects that may impair the patient's capacity to give
informed consent or refusal.

(Choice C) Rescheduling the operation without first addressing the patient's concerns and
conducting a new informed consent process is inappropriate.

(Choice D) Reviewing only the benefits of the procedure and the risks of no treatment may

pressure the patient to reconsent. An informed consent discussion must also include the risks

of the procedure and the risks/benefits of alternate treatments.
