Informed consent is a complex medicolegal process that varies slightly across jurisdiction
and setting (eg, a clinical versus research setting). Informed consent is generally considered
to contain 4 primary elements: disclosure, understanding, voluntariness, and
authorization. Disclosure involves providing the patient with information about their medical

condition, the proposed medical intervention (eg, experimental drug), and the potential risks
and benefits of accepting or declining the proposed intervention. For a consent to be valid, a
subject must possess decision-making capacity, and the research coordinator must confirm
understanding of the disclosed information. Informed consent must be voluntarily given and

be free from any forces of coercion or manipulation.

In the described scenario, the research coordinator has suggested to the wife that the
experimental medication is likely to help her husband, but that the research study may not be
"successful" if more participants don't enroll. This is manipulative and violates the principle of
voluntariness because the patient's wife may feel coerced to participate to help her husband.

(Choices A and C) The major principles of medical ethics include autonomy, beneficence,
nonmaleficence, and justice. Beneficence refers to the ethical imperative for medical
interventions to be guided by an intent to do good for a patient. Nonmaleficence refers to the

ethical principle of avoiding doing harm to a patient.
