(Choices B and E) Children with bacterial meningitis are at high risk for complications (eg,
increased intracranial pressure, seizures) during the first few days of treatment and require
hospital-level care for treatment and monitoring of complications, which cannot be safely done
in the home setting. Oral antibiotics do not adequately penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid and
are not a substitute for IV antibiotics. In addition, the mother has stated her intention to pursue
homeopathic treatment and has not agreed to comply with either oral or IV antibiotics.

(Choice D) Discharge against medical advice is inappropriate when there is significant risk of
serious harm and death to a child. If it was the mother's own treatment at issue, then she
could reasonably be discharged against medical advice.

Educational objective:
It is a physician's duty to advocate for the best interests of a child. When a child is at

significant risk of harm, parental authority to make medical decisions can be challenged. In
cases where educational and collaborative efforts fail, protective services should be contacted.
