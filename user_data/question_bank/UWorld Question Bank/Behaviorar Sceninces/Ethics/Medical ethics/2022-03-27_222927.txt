Most medical decisions are made via shared decision-making, in which the patient's
preferences and personal values are considered when discussing 22 medically reasonable
treatment options (Choice D). However, when there is only 1 medically reasonable
treatment option that has clearly superior evidence-based support, it is ethically appropriate
for the physician to provide directive counseling, in which only a single treatment option is

recommended to a patient.

This patient has a complete placenta previa, a condition in which the entire placenta covers
the cervix, which is associated with a high risk of maternal (eg, hemorrhage) and fetal (eg,
intrauterine demise) morbidity and mortality with vaginal delivery. Due to these risks, the only
safe option for delivery, as stated to this patient, is cesarean delivery. Although this patient
prefers a vaginal delivery, it is inappropriate for the physician to discuss this choice as a safe
and reasonable option. It is the physician's ethical responsibility to advise against it and
provide directive counseling by explaining why a cesarean delivery is medically necessary.

(Choice A) Assisted decision-making occurs when a family member or other caregiver helps
the patient in making a medical decision (but does not make the decision for the patient).
Common scenarios include when patients have intellectual disability or a potentially reversible
impairment in decision-making capacity (eg, fluctuating mental illness [schizophrenia]).
