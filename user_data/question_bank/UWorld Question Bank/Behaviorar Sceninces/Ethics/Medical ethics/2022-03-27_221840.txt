Question Id: 10450
Physicians are commonly approached by friends and family for informal medical care

ranging from prescriptions for antibiotics to treatment of complex medical issues. However,
the wish to be helpful must be balanced with ethical considerations related to the risks of
compromising objectivity and clinical judgment when treating a friend.

Potential problems that could result in patient harm (maleficence) include failure to perform an
adequate assessment of sensitive issues related to depression (eg, suicide risk), the possibility
that the patient will not be completely forthcoming due to the friendship, treating conditions that
may be outside of the physician's expertise, and lack of appropriate documentation and follow-
up. In addition, from a medico-legal perspective, writing a prescription establishes a physician-
patient relationship and may be problematic in the event of an adverse outcome.

Professional medical organizations with published ethics guidelines consistently recommend
that treatment of friends and family be limited to emergency situations when no other

physician is available. The most appropriate response is for the physician to decline to write
the prescription, explaining that the nature of their relationship prevents objective treatment.

(Choice A) Physicians may feel pressured to accommodate requests from friends, but
offering a limited supply of medication is not indicated in this nonemergency situation. The
physician should encourage the friend to schedule an appointment with her provider.
