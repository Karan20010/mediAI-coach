physician should encourage the friend to schedule an appointment with her provider.
(Choice B) Describing the friend's psychiatric history as complex may be viewed as
judgmental and is not the fundamental reason for declining the request for medication. It is
preferable to explain how the nature of their friendship compromises the physician's ability to

treat her objectively.

(Choice C) Although it is well intentioned, scheduling a full evaluation to determine whether
antidepressants are indicated does not solve the ethical problem of treating a friend ina
nonemergency situation.

(Choice E) This option makes the unfounded assumption that another physician would be
willing to prescribe medication without reevaluating the patient in person.

Educational objective:

Providing informal treatment to friends and family is ethically problematic due to lack of
objectivity that can negatively impact clinical judgment. It should generally be limited to
emergency situations in which no other physician is available.
