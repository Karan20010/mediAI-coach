Advance directives record a patient's personal preferences for health care and treatment if
the patient lacks decision-making capacity. During hospital admissions, all patients admitted
to the hospital must be asked about resuscitation preferences (eg, full code, Do-Not-
Resuscitate [DNR]) and whether advance directives are in place because serious clinical
deterioration can happen unexpectedly.

Advance directives include the following types of documents:

¢ Living will, which specifies the patient's end-of-life wishes and often includes instructions
regarding intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, enteral feeding, and other life-
prolonging interventions. Given the breadth of medical scenarios that can arise, not all
decisions can be accounted for in a living will.

¢ Ahealth care proxy, which designates a specific individual (the surrogate decision-
maker) to make health care decisions and interpret instructions in the living will on the
patient's behalf if the patient is incapacitated, using the principle of substituted judgment
(ie, considering what the patient would want).

Ideally, advance care planning should take place through a series of open-ended

conversations early in a patient's serious illness (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in
