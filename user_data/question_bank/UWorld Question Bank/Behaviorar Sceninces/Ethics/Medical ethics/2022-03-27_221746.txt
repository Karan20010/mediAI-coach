(ie, substituted judgement), rather than their own preferences.

(Choices A, B, and C) Next of kin is not determined by birth order or current living situation;
both adult children have equal standing and should be encouraged to make decisions jointly.
Although all surrogates are charged to make decisions with consideration to the patient's best
interest, the primary guiding principle is substituted judgment (ie, what the patient would want).

(Choice E) Although a physician may institute emergency life-saving measures without
consent if no surrogate decision-maker is available, the physician does not know what the
patient would have wanted. Consent from the next of kin is preferable.

Educational objective:

Consent for an incapacitated patient can often be obtained from an advance directive, either a
living will or designated proxy. In the absence of an advance directive, decision-making falls to
the next of kin, who is responsible for making decisions based on what they believe the patient
would want (substituted judgement).
