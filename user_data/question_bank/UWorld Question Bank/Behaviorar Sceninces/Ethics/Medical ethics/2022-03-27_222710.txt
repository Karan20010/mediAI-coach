Question Id: 1128

Although patients with schizophrenia are at higher risk for cognitive difficulties that may result
in impaired decision-making, a diagnosis of schizophrenia, by itself, is not a reason to assume
the patient lacks decision-making capacity. This patient is alert, oriented, and able to
understand and communicate a preferred treatment option (ie, she doesn't want surgery and
prefers to go home on antibiotics). It is less clear to what extent she appreciates the
consequences of her decision and whether current psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions,
hallucinations) may be influencing her ability to weigh the risks and benefits rationally.

When there is a possibility that psychiatric symptoms are impairing cognition, the next step is
to perform a formal, decision-specific capacity assessment. The patient's ability to
understand and weigh the risks of going home should be explored. Delusions or
hallucinations, if present, are only relevant to the assessment if they interfere with the patient's
decision-making (eg, if the patient was hearing and following command hallucinations). If she
meets the 4 requisite criteria for decisional capacity, her decision should be respected.

(Choice A) This patient appears to be psychiatrically stable on her current dose of
risperidone, and there is no indication that she is experiencing an acute exacerbation of
psychotic symptoms that would require a dosage increase.

(Choice C) A patient cannot be hospitalized involuntarily on the basis of a diagnosis of
