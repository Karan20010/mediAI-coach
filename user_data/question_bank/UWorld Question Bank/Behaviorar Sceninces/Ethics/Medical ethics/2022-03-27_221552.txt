This patient at 8 weeks gestation with bruising is affected by intimate partner violence (IPV),
which is any type of physical, psychologic, or sexual harm committed by a partner or spouse.
During pregnancy and postpartum, patients and their partners experience marked increases
in emotional, physical, and financial stressors. Initially, partners may be angry about the
pregnancy but can later become supportive and exhibit gentler behavior. However, as
pressure and responsibility increase, the partner may begin to blame the patient and
pregnancy.

These factors can cause an increase in IPV during pregnancy, particularly in patients who
experienced IPV prepregnancy. Because physical violence is typically directed at both the
patient and the fetus (eg, hitting the pregnant abdomen), pregnant women are at significant
risk for maternal morbidity (eg, injury, depression), homicide, and pregnancy complications
(eg, preterm labor, abruptio placentae) due to abdominal trauma.

Therefore, screening for IPV is required at the initial prenatal visit, during each trimester, and
postpartum. Patients who screen positive should be assessed for immediate safety and
given additional resources (eg, information about a domestic violence program) for long-
term safety planning (eg, housing, childcare, finances). In some jurisdictions, there may also
be mandatory reporting requirements for IPV during pregnancy.
