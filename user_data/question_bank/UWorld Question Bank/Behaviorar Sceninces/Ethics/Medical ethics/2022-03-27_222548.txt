a poor diagnosis (eg, "it will be difficult to hear"), which violates health privacy.

(Choice B) The impact of bad news should be considered; however, this statement
references the patient's history of depression and suicidality, which is protected health
information. In addition, the physician cannot violate confidentiality by sharing results with the
patient's son without her permission.

(Choice D) Although the statement expresses empathy, it does not give the son a chance to
explain why he opposes disclosing the diagnosis. Premature dismissal of his concerns risks
the loss of valuable information (eg, safety concerns).

(Choice E) This approach assumes that the son's intention is to avoid distressing his mother.
However, the underlying reason may be something else (eg, cultural norms, the patient's own
wishes). The physician should keep an open mind to the son's concerns and not presume to
know the patient's feelings without speaking to her first.

Educational objective:

Autonomy, which supports a patient's right to know his or her diagnosis, is a fundamental
ethical principle. However, limiting disclosure of a diagnosis may be appropriate under certain
circumstances (eg, patient preference, imminent safety concerns). An understanding, open
approach is necessary to uncover these circumstances.
