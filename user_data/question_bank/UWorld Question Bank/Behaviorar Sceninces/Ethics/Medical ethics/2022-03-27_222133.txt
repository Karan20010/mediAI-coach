This patient is declining recommended treatment for her newborn based on the reasoning that
she has not had a sexually transmitted infection (STI). This may reflect a lack of
understanding that STIs may be asymptomatic and/or lack of knowledge that preventive
treatment is recommended for all newborns. The patient should be counseled

that prophylactic erythromycin is recommended for all newborns to prevent blindness from

Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

As part of the process of informed consent, all necessary information about indications for
treatment as well as risks and benefits of accepting and refusing treatment should be
provided, and the patient should be encouraged to ask questions. Whenever a patient
declines or is hesitant to accept treatment, the initial step is for the physician to assess the
patient's knowledge, provide clarification when needed (as in this case), listen to concerns,
and understand the specific reasons for the refusal. The process of obtaining informed
consent should be conducted in a nonjudgmental and noncoercive way.

(Choices A and E) These statements automatically accept or reject the patient's decision
without determining her level of understanding, providing needed clarification, and addressing
concerns. Responding to treatment refusal should first involve assessing the patient's
understanding of the indications, risks, and benefits of treatment.
