Settings

(Choice A) Advising the patient to stay with a relative for the duration of the pregnancy is not
recommended because the provider cannot predict the partner's response (eg, potential
increase in violence) or new safety concerns that may arise if the patient abruptly relocates.

(Choice C) Recommending the patient file a restraining order against her boyfriend is
inappropriate; the duty of the provider is to assess for imminent risk and provide medical and
psychosocial resources, not to offer legal advice. In addition, a restraining order may cause
the partner to retaliate.

(Choices D and E) Referring the patient and her boyfriend to couples’ therapy or
recommending that the patient bring her boyfriend to the next prenatal appointment is
inappropriate because confrontation or involvement of the partner at this time could endanger
both the patient and the provider.

Educational objective:

Intimate partner violence (IPV) increases during pregnancy and the postpartum period and can
cause significant maternal and pregnancy complications. Pregnant patients affected by IPV
require immediate safety planning (eg, information about a domestic violence program) and
resources for long-term planning.
