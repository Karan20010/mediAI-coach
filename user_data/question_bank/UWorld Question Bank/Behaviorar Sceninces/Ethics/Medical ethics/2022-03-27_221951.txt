disoriented in his apartment. The patient's medical history includes chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and tobacco use. He is unmarried
and lives alone. The friend says that the patient has a sister who lives in the area but is
unaware of when they last spoke. The friend has known the patient for 5 years and says that
they are "good buddies." He tells the physician that they have discussed dying and that he
believes the patient would prefer to "go naturally" and would refuse any heroic measures,
including "being hooked up to a ventilator." Temperature is 39 C (102.2 F), blood pressure is
120/80 mm Hg, pulse is 105/min, and respirations are 24/min. Oxygen saturation is 88% on
room air and 93% on 2 L of oxygen. The patient is somnolent and unable to answer
questions. The lungs have bilateral wheezing and decreased breath sounds. Chest x-ray
reveals a right lower lobe infiltrate. Appropriate bronchodilator and antibiotic therapies are

respond to initial treatment in the next 2-3 hours. Which of the following is the most
