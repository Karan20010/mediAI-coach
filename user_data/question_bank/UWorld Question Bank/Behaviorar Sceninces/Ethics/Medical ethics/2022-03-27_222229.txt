(Choice C) Patients must be given adequate time to read a consent form but this is not an
appropriate replacement for a direct conversation with the physician. Although some
institutions require a witness to be present during signing, this does not otherwise alter the
obligations for IC.

(Choice D) Patients may ask additional questions regarding treatment after giving consent
and may withdraw consent at any time. However, the patient should not sign an IC document
prior to an adequate discussion.

(Choice E) While awaiting the attending's return, the resident may obtain additional
information to educate the patient. However, reading third-party references without having a
thorough understanding of, and experience with, a particular procedure is not adequate to
obtain IC, especially for a high-risk procedure (eg, pericardiocentesis).

Educational objective:

Informed consent (IC) should be obtained by the attending physician performing the
procedure, who can best explain the procedure and answer any questions. If IC is delegated
to another provider on the care team, the team member must thoroughly understand the
procedure and be able to answer the patient's questions.
