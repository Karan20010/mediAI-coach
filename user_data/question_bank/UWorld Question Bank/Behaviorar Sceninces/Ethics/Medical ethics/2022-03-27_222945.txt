Common scenarios include when patients have intellectual disability or a potentially reversible
impairment in decision-making capacity (eg, fluctuating mental illness [schizophrenia]).

(Choice C) Informed refusal refers to the patient's refusal of a recommended medical
treatment following an informed consent discussion (including full disclosure of the risks of
refusing treatment). This would occur in this case if, after discussion of the need for cesarean
delivery, the patient refuses the procedure.

(Choice E) Substituted judgment occurs when a surrogate decision-maker makes a health
care decision for an incapacitated patient based on the surrogate's knowledge of the patient's
wishes and values.

Educational objective:

Directive counseling is ethically appropriate when only one treatment option is medically
reasonable and has clearly superior evidence-based support. Patients with complete placenta
previa should be counseled that cesarean delivery is medically necessary.
