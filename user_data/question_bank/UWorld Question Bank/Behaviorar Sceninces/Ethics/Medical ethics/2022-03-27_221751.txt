A 65-year-old man is admitted to the inpatient unit of a busy community hospital for worsening
shortness of breath over the last few days. He has a 40-pack-year smoking history and was
initially diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and treated
accordingly. Chest x-ray on admission shows a large hilar opacity, and CT scan confirms the
presence of a 4-cm mass in the right hilum. During the process of obtaining informed consent
for bronchoscopy with biopsy, the patient says, "Doc, please don't tell me what they find,
because if it's cancer, | don't want to know." Which of the following is the most appropriate
response to this patient's request?

© A. "Hearing you have a lung mass is upsetting; perhaps take some time to think about
whether you really want to undergo this procedure."

©) B. "| can't imagine how stressful this is for you, but if the results do show cancer, it
would be important for you to make a decision about treatment."

() C."l won't share the results of the procedure if that is your preference, although |
would like to understand how you came to that decision."

©) D. "It's normal to try and avoid hearing bad news; however, the uncertainty of not
knowing your diagnosis can cause even more anxiety."
