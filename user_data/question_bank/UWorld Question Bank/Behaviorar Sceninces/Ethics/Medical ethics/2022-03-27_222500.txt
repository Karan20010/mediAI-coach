Question Id: 7767

Although gift giving as an expression of gratitude is common in many cultures, accepting gifts
from patients can raise complex issues in the physician-patient relationship. From an ethical
standpoint, expensive gifts may influence or appear to influence the physician's
professional judgment (eg, gift is given or perceived to be given in expectation of preferential
treatment and/or impacts the physician's adherence to the standard of care). The consensus
and professional standard are that it is unethical to accept gifts of significant monetary
value. Some medical offices and hospitals implement a no-gift rule to keep things simple
while others implement a dollar-amount rule.

Declining a valuable gift should be done with care to protect the patient's feelings and avoid
damaging the physician-patient relationship. The physician should acknowledge the patient's
generosity and thoughtfulness behind the gift, explain why the gift cannot be accepted (eg,
personal, practice, or hospital policy), and assure the patient that this does not in any way
change the care provided. Accepting gifts of low monetary value given as a token of
appreciation or cultural tradition and that are not intended to influence care is generally
considered appropriate (eg, homemade, small gifts that are clearly inexpensive). In this
situation, it would be appropriate to accept the cookies and card but decline the expensive

tickets with an explanation.
