(Choice C) According to the patient's wishes, he should not receive cardiopulmonary
resuscitation measures. However, nonresuscitative supportive care (eg, supplemental
oxygen) and comfort measures (eg, pain medication) should continue as usual and not be
withheld.

(Choice D) Court proceedings are time-consuming and disruptive. They are generally
necessary only when a suitable surrogate cannot be identified or when there are intractable
disagreements among surrogates (eg, multiple adult children).

(Choice E) Treatment of ventricular fibrillation with antiarrhythmic medications is considered
part of the ACLS resuscitation algorithm and is generally excluded as part of a do-not-
resuscitate order. In general, partial algorithm implementation should not be considered in the
absence of specific guidance from the patient or surrogate.

Educational objective:

When a patient is unable to communicate his or her wishes regarding care and does not have
an advance directive or designated surrogate decision-maker, decision-making falls to the next
of kin (eg, spouse). The next of kin is generally determined by the proximity of relationship
and is responsible for making decisions based on what they believe the patient would want
and the patient's best interest.
