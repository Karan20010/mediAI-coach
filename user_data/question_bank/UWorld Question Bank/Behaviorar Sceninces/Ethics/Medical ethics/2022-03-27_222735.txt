Question Id: 10533

Untreated bacterial meningitis is a medically dangerous and potentially lethal condition. This
mother's decision to take her child home and discontinue intravenous (IV) antibiotics after only
2 days places the child and his siblings at significant risk of serious harm and death. When
efforts to resolve the situation are unsuccessful, physicians have an ethical duty to advocate
for the best interests of the child and challenge parental authority to make medical decisions
for the child. In such cases, involvement of a state child protection agency becomes

necessary.

Whenever possible, efforts should first be made to collaborate with the parents with the goal of
reaching a mutually agreed upon treatment plan and safe outcome for the child. Physicians
should counsel and educate the parents to address any misconceptions about the illness and
treatment. It also may be helpful to consult with the ethics committee who can provide input
on ethical issues as well as mediate further discussion.

(Choice A) There is no indication that the mother lacks decision-making capacity. She
understands the risks of stopping treatment and provides a rationale for her decision.
However, in this case, the best interest of the child becomes the overriding focus, rather than
the mother's right to make autonomous decisions. The physician must act to protect the
child's life despite parental wishes.
