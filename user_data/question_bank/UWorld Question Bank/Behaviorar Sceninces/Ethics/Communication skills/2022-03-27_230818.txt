(Choice B) Handwriting can be time-consuming, leading to use of abbreviations and
shortcuts; many nuances can be lost or misinterpreted, and information may be left out for the
sake of brevity. Therefore, writing is not recommended as the primary mode of
communication.

(Choice C) Supplemental communication measures can include written information sheets,
standardized questionnaires, and captioned educational videos; however, the information
conveyed by these modalities is limited, and they should not be used as the primary method of
communication.

(Choice D) Many deaf and hard of hearing individuals learn lip reading and expressive
gestures to facilitate communication in casual settings. However, these methods are subject
to error or misunderstanding and should not be relied on as a primary communication modality
in health care.

Educational objective:

Deaf and hard of hearing patients should be offered the services of an interpreter trained in
medical translation and American Sign Language, subject to patient preference and consent.
Alternate modes of communication include computer-assisted real-time transcription and
