(Choices B and E) The patient has decision-making capacity, and his preference not to be
informed should be respected. Questioning the patient's decision and consulting with the
chaplain or the patient's son are not necessary and may be perceived as disrespectful.

(Choice C) This response puts pressure on the patient to accept the information when he has
clearly stated that he does not want to know.

Educational objective:

Patients have the right to refuse to receive medical information for individual or cultural
reasons. In some cultures, family members may make health care decisions to avoid
perceived harm, disrespect, or mental distress caused by direct disclosure to the patient.
