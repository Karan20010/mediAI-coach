responding to the wife's acute, emotional distress in a compassionate manner that allows for
open discussion.

(Choice C) This response attributes the suicide to medication changes when it is unclear to
what extent, if any, this was a contributing factor.

(Choice D) This statement empathizes with the wife's shock but asks her to share details of
her husband's death, which she may not feel comfortable doing. It is preferable to allow the
wife to express her grief and ask any questions she may have about her husband's illness and
treatment.

(Choice E) Asking the wife if she noticed anything unusual in the week leading up to the
suicide may have the unintended consequence of making her feel that she missed signs and is
in some way to blame.
