This afebrile patient with a normal lung examination most likely has a viral upper respiratory
infection. The physician is faced with the common clinical issue of responding to a request
for an unnecessary antibiotic prescription. Although many patients receive antibiotics for
upper respiratory infections, antibiotic use in uncomplicated upper respiratory infections is
associated with increased risk of adverse effects, no improvement compared to placebo, and
a rise in antibiotic resistance.

The most appropriate response is a patient-centered approach that validates the patient's
concerns, educates the patient about the adverse effects of antibiotics and their lack of
efficacy in treating viral infections, and provides options to treat the patient symptomatically.
This must be done in an empathic and nonjudgmental fashion that helps build, not undermine,
the physician-patient relationship. The physician should refrain from prescribing antibiotics
and advise the patient to return if symptoms persist or worsen.

(Choice A) This statement does not explain why antibiotics are not an appropriate treatment
at this time and may be interpreted as dismissive given the patient's specific request.

(Choice B) Although this may be true, it is not constructive to criticize previous treatment
providers.
