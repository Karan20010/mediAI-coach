(Choice A) This response redirects the conversation to the benefits of quitting and fails to
acknowledge or explore the patient's resistance to change and his personal barriers to quitting.

(Choice B) Although this statement acknowledges the patient's stress and conveys optimism
about his ability to quit, it fails to address his ambivalent feelings, which may cause the patient
to feel misunderstood and judged for his reluctance to quit.

(Choice D) This response explores the patient's understanding of specific health risks of
smoking but misses the opportunity to develop the patient's internal motivation to quit.

(Choice E) The physician should first explore the patient's personal concerns and barriers to
quitting before discussing smoking cessation treatment options.

Educational objective:

For patients who are not ready to quit smoking, it is helpful to explore their perspective about
the pros and cons of continuing to smoke. Acknowledging resistance in a nonjudgmental
manner while exploring ambivalence can help develop patients’ internal motivation to change.
