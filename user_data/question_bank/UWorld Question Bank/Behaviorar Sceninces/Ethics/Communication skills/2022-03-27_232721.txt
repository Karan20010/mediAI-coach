states he wants to make sure he is taking care of his health after his father had a myocardial
infarction a few months ago at the age of 61. He has been eating healthy and exercising 3 to
4 times a week. Past medical history is noncontributory, and the patient takes no
medications. He shares that his aunt is an herbalist and recently gave him a supplement that
is supposed to help prevent cardiovascular disease. The patient asks whether it is okay to
start taking the supplement and provides a list of the ingredients, which includes herbs
unfamiliar to the physician. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?

maintain cardiovascular health by eating healthy and exercising."

let you know what | find."

©) C."l'm not familiar with these herbs, but studies have shown that herbs don't have
significant effects on preventing cardiovascular disease."

©) D. "This supplement probably won't prevent cardiovascular disease, but it's likely safe

for you to take if you want to."
