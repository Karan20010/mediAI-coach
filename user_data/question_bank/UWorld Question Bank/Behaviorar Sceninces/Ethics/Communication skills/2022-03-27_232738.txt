(Choice D) Although many herbal supplements are benign, the physician should not assume
safety without first obtaining reliable information about the product. A number of herbal agents
(eg, ephedra, ma-huang) cause potentially severe cardiovascular toxicity.

(Choice E) This response honestly presents the physician's lack of knowledge but avoids the
patient's direct question and misses an opportunity to improve the patient's health and the
physician-patient relationship.

Educational objective:

When discussing complementary and alternative medical interventions, the physician should
be honest, helpful, and nonjudgmental, developing a trusting physician-patient relationship
conducive to sharing evidence-based information. Physicians should obtain more information
on unfamiliar products and follow up with the patient or direct the patient to reliable information

sources.
