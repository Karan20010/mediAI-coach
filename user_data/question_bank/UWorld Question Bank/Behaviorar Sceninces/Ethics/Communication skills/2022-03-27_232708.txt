medication and focus on the wife's concerns rather than the patient's. This may put the patient
on the defensive, leading to a deterioration of the physician-patient relationship. In addition,
asking the patient if he is having trouble with remembering his medications is an example of a

yes/no, closed-ended question.

(Choice C) Although patients should be given the opportunity to speak to the physician alone,

Educational objective:

Patient-centered medical interviewing should focus on the patient's perspective of the illness.
Interviews are best initiated with an open-ended question that elicits the patient's major
concerns in the patient's own words.
