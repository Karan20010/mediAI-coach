¢ explaining the risks, benefits, and limitations of vaccinations.

In this case, the first step is to establish trust by acknowledging the parent's concern and
recognizing a common goal, the well-being of the child.

(Choice B) Although proceeding with vaccination is the objective, this mother has expressed
specific concerns that should be addressed first.

(Choice C) Providing a list of evidence-based resources helps educate parents and is
recommended when discussing immunizations. However, active dialogue with this parent who
is vaccine-hesitant should be pursued first to discuss and correct misinformation.

(Choice D) Reopening the conversation at visits after initial refusal is critical because up to
half of vaccine-hesitant parents ultimately choose to vaccinate. However, every opportunity for
open dialogue should be taken rather than immediately deferring the conversation to a later
time.

(Choice E) Discussing the risks of natural infection is essential in addressing vaccine
benefits. However, this mother may perceive her fears about vaccination to be valid if the
provider does not dispel her inaccurate beliefs but instead focuses only on the risks of natural
infection.
