(Choices C and D) Friends and family members are not ideal for language interpretation due

to lack of impartiality and possible barriers to open communication regarding sensitive topics

(eg, domestic abuse). They may also be unfamiliar with medical terminology and may struggle

to accurately convey complex medical information (although this patient's son has medical

training). This patient should be offered the services of a trained medical translator; family

would be used only if the patient declines an outside translator.

(Choice E) Although this statement reflects a potential reason to avoid using family members
as interpreters, there is nothing in the family interaction to suggest a lack of objectivity, and
such a direct response may be taken as demeaning or insensitive.

Educational objective:

Physicians must ensure the appropriate use of medical interpreters to promote adequate
patient understanding and participation in the decision-making process. This is particularly
important when obtaining informed consent for treatment.
