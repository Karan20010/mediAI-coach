Congestive heart failure carries a high rate of hospital readmission. The potential reasons

for readmission are numerous and variable and can include premature discharge, inadequate
outpatient follow-up, inadequate social support, dietary indiscretion, and medication errors (eg,
missed or duplicate prescriptions). In addition, patients may not thoroughly understand how to
take their medications, what each medication is for, or what to do if their symptoms begin to
relapse.

Predischarge counseling typically begins with exploring patients' level of understanding
and health literacy (ie, ability to process basic health information and make appropriate health
decisions). Patients should have an opportunity to express their questions and concerns
about factors at home that may lead to readmission. If possible, education should be
provided by a multidisciplinary team (eg, pharmacist, physical therapist) that can address
specific aspects of care. In addition, follow-up phone calls and telemonitoring (eg, blood
pressure checks) after discharge may be helpful.

(Choice A) Friends and family members can often help patients by assisting with activities of
daily living, reinforcing treatment plans, and alerting outpatient providers to early signs of
clinical decompensation. However, it would be premature to enlist others to help before
understanding the reasons for readmission.
