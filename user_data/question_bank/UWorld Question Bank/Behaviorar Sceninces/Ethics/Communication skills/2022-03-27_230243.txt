Trust (ie, belief in the physician's recommendations and intentions) is central to the physician-
patient therapeutic alliance and necessary for optimal outcomes. Distrust may arise from
prior negative health care experiences, such as adverse events (eg, diagnostic error, treatment
failure) or overt or perceived physician bias (eg, against uninsured patients).

This patient with signs of posttraumatic peritonitis (eg, rebound tenderness, guarding)
expresses reluctance to undergo surgery in a way that signals distrust (ie, concern that she is
being treated as a guinea pig). To ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment and
an optimal outcome, the physician should apply the following principles to build trust and
promote treatment acceptability:

e Acknowledge trust as a central therapeutic goal.
¢ Find common ground (eg, identify a shared goal of feeling better).

¢ Seek patient perspectives and prioritize patient-centered care (ie, treatment aligned with
patient values).
(Choice A) This statement unnecessarily focuses the discussion on the physician's
perspective (eg, compensation) without addressing the patient's concern about being a guinea
pig or exploring her underlying reasons for refusing surgery.
