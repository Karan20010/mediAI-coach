provider. Such a statement might be appropriate as a cheerful end to the conversation but is

(Choice E) This patient's feelings of guilt may be related to his family background, but his
concerns focus specifically on his lifestyle habits and diabetic control rather than genetic
factors in the etiology of diabetes.

Educational objective:

Failure of oral medications is common in long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus due to
