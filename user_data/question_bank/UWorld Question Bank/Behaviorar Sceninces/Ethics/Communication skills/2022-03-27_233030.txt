(Choice B) This is an example of noncollaborative agenda-setting. It is less likely to be
effective than eliciting the patient's perspective.

(Choice C) Encouraging the patient to make a long list of changes is rarely helpful. It is likely
to overwhelm him and may actually decrease his motivation.

(Choice D) This question fails to consider the patient's perspective about his job (ie, "| can't
wait to get back to work") and reflects a premature suggestion. Exploring the patient's
thoughts and feelings about his work is a better approach, eliciting his suggestions about how
to best integrate his health goals into his schedule.

Educational objective:

When counseling a patient who has multiple unhealthy behaviors, the best approach is to
focus on 1 or 2 specific behaviors the patient feels most ready to change. This improves the
likelihood of change by focusing on realistic goals the patient is more likely to pursue.
