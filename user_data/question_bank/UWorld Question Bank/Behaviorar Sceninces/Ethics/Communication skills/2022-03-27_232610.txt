Question Id: 106757
Sex is a biologic identity determined by anatomy (eg, external genitalia), chromosomes, and
hormones. In contrast, gender identity is an internal identity that can be expressed externally
(eg, clothing, behavior). Although biologic sex is often used to guide medical diagnosis,
particularly for conditions such as abdominal pain, physicians must also recognize gender
diversity to provide culturally competent medical care to transgender patients.

This begins with accurately identifying the patient's preferred name and gender identifier.
Physicians should approach questions about gender identity in a supportive and tactful
manner. Because physical attributes and self-identifiers (eg, clothing) of transgender patients
may not be evident or may change over time, a tactful approach uses open-ended questions
to elicit the patient's preferences. It is helpful to use a routine opening statement (eg, "I ask all
my patients about their preferred name and pronouns") that normalizes gender diversity.
The patient's preferences should then be accurately and consistently documented in the
electronic medical record.

(Choices A and C) Although these questions acknowledge gender diversity, they are both
closed-ended and too abrupt for an introduction. They also assume a binary male-female
paradigm and exclude recognition of a nonbinary gender, in which a person views gender as a
spectrum and identifies as neither male nor female.
