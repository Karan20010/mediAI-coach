This patient has a family history of lung cancer and multiple risk factors for cardiovascular
illness, including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and family history of stroke. Although
he states that he is not ready to quit smoking, he is ambivalent and aware that he probably
should. An effective approach to patients who are not ready to quit is to explore their
ambivalence (eg, worries about quitting vs not quitting), with the goal of enhancing the
patient's internal motivation to make a change.

Based on principles of motivational interviewing, the physician should acknowledge resistance
to change and help the patient identify discrepancies between habits and long-term goals.
Issues relevant to the patient's situation (eg, concern about his ability to manage work stress
without smoking) and other possible barriers (eg, fear of nicotine withdrawal, failure, or gaining
weight; enjoyment of tobacco) should be explored in a nonjudgmental way. Concerns about
not quitting, such as fear of long-term health risks, can then be elicited to highlight
ambivalence. Once the patient has identified the potential benefits and barriers to quitting, the
physician can target these specific issues (eg, education, counseling, medication).

(Choice A) This response redirects the conversation to the benefits of quitting and fails to

acknowledge or explore the patient's resistance to change and his personal barriers to quitting.

(Choice B) Although this statement acknowledges the patient's stress and conveys optimism
