(Choice D) Although it may be appropriate to explore a patient's discomfort with a particular
topic, this question is premature because it relies on the unverified assumption that the patient
is uncomfortable with the topic, which may make her defensive. Normalizing sexual history
and explaining why it is important is more likely to be productive.

(Choice E) It would be inappropriate to offer a diagnosis before completing a full evaluation
and workup.

Educational objective:
Sexual history is an essential part of gathering a complete medical history. This topic may be

uncomfortable for both patient and physician, so it is important to normalize it as a routine part
of a medical evaluation.
