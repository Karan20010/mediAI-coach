In the United States, disability is a form of insurance that is administered by private insurance
carriers or by the Social Security Administration. It provides financial assistance to workers
who are unable to continue working due to a medical or psychiatric condition. Certification of
disability by a physician is usually required by these entities before the benefit is granted.

This patient's demand that the physician sign a disability form presents a difficult situation.
Pain is highly subjective and, at this point in the interaction, the physician knows very little
about this patient. Possibilities include malingering or exaggeration of extent of disability to
obtain benefits, inadequately treated pain, or chronic pain resulting in legitimate disability.
This patient may also have had negative interactions with health care providers or a
psychiatric condition that contributes to his angry, demanding behavior. The best approach is
to politely but firmly explain that determining medical disability requires further
assessment of his symptoms, physical examination, and testing if indicated.

(Choice A) Many individuals with legitimate medical disabilities may use substances; it is not
a reason to deny disability benefits.

(Choice B) It is premature to suggest that this patient is attempting to commit fraud without
performing an appropriate history and physical examination.
