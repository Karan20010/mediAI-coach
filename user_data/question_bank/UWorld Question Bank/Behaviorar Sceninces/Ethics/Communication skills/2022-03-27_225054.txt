sexually transmitted disease testing), it should not be the focus of the initial statement after
patients make a vulnerable disclosure of sexual assault. Adequate time should be spent
reassuring safety and allowing patients to direct the pacing of the evaluation. In contrast,
recommending that patients undergo a pelvic examination without first setting them at ease
and discussing the indications and benefits may lead to retraumatization.

(Choice B) Emergency contraception is important to address following sexual assault;
however, it should be discussed with the patient after establishing rapport, performing the
examination, and obtaining appropriate testing (eg, urine pregnancy test).

(Choice E) Although trauma can affect memory, the most likely cause of this patient's hazy
memory is the assailant's use of a mind-altering date-rape drug. In addition, the statement is
dismissive of the patient's reason to not file a police report, and it may make her feel pressured
to involve the police or feel guilty if she chooses not to.

Educational objective:

Physicians are often the first line of support for survivors of sexual assault. Disclosure of
sexual assault should be met with supportive, nonjudgmental, and patient-centered
statements. Patients are encouraged to set the pacing of the evaluation.
