This patient experienced a severe medication allergy with respiratory distress. Although key
information did not accompany the patient at the time of transfer, this event was likely
preventable. In cases where important information is missing or incomplete, clinicians have a
duty to obtain the information as soon as possible. Because of the harm done to the patient,
this clinician is at risk for a medical malpractice claim.

Most patients who experience complications, even avoidable complications, do not initiate a
malpractice lawsuit. Patients who sue providers are typically not driven by financial rewards,
but are more likely to be motivated by anger, distrust, or a feeling that the clinician is not
concerned for their well-being. Often, patients report poor communication from the provider
and file a lawsuit simply to get a better understanding of what happened.

When speaking with a patient following a medical error, clinicians should directly and honestly
discuss that an error occurred; concealing an error can appear dishonest and generate
anger if the error is later discovered. The conversation should allow opportunity for the patient
to ask questions, and answers should be given with language that the patient can
understand. A plan to rectify the error should be provided. The provider should then convey
concern for the patient and remain engaged with the patient's care until the issue has been
resolved.
