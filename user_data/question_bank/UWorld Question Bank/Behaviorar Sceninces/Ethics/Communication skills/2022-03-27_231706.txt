A 27-year-old man comes to the office for follow-up regarding a herniated disc. He first injured
the disc 3 months ago while at work. Nonsurgical treatment options, including physical
therapy and as-needed NSAIDs and tramadol, were recommended. The patient has
completed physical therapy, and follow-up MRI indicates that the herniated disc has
regressed. He reports a significant amount of ongoing pain and asks for a dose increase and
refill of his pain medication. In the past month, the patient has been to the emergency
department on 2 occasions to request pain medication due to running out before his next
scheduled refill. Vital signs are within normal limits, and physical examination is
unremarkable. Which of the following statements by the physician would be most appropriate
at this time?

©) A. "Given your recent refill requests and interest in increasing your dose, | am
concerned that you may be dependent on pain medication."

©) B. "It doesn't seem like medication is effective anymore; let's talk about alternate ways
to treat your pain."

(©) C. "Sometimes patients take pain medications to help with other types of symptoms;
how has your mood been recently?"
