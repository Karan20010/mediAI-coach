This child with a history of recurrent otitis media now has acute mastoiditis, a purulent infection
of the mastoid air cells. Untreated mastoiditis can lead to serious complications, including
brain abscess and death, and requires aggressive management. Initial treatment includes
parenteral antibiotics, and patients often require surgical intervention.

Patients and surrogate decision-makers (eg, parents, guardians) often have limited
understanding of serious but uncommon conditions, such as mastoiditis. They also may have
misconceptions regarding the potential risks and benefits of medical treatment. Decision-
making can be further complicated by the urgency to make life-or-death decisions quickly in
unfamiliar environments (eg, emergency department).

The initial step in counseling patients and surrogate decision-makers regarding refusal of
treatment is to calmly probe their understanding of the disease process. This can be
followed by counseling and education tailored to the decision-maker's level of
understanding and health literacy and an objective assessment of treatment options.
Although a court order may be necessary to compel the parents to allow life-saving treatment,
legal action can be distressing to all involved. Often, once the disease process and treatment
options are better understood, decision-makers become less resistant to treatment.
