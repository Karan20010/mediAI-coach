Question Id: 21423
This patient shows several signs that are concerning for potential violence, including a recent
incident of violent/self-destructive behavior resulting in injury and escalating agitation
and angry, demanding behavior in the emergency department. The self-harm incident
occurred in the context of an acute and devastating loss. The meaning of his vaguely
threatening statement ("have to get out of here and set things straight with my wife and kids")
is unclear and a concerning sign for potential further harm to himself or his family. His
agitation has likely been compounded by a long wait time, and the physician must respond to
the patient's impatience to leave and at the same time perform a necessary safety evaluation.

The potential for further violence should be addressed directly. The patient should be asked
if he is having any thoughts or impulses to hurt anyone or himself. If the patient is feeling
homicidal and/or suicidal, he should not be allowed to leave the emergency department and
should be placed on hold, involuntarily if necessary.

(Choice A) The disinhibiting effects of alcohol or drugs can increase the risk for violence, and
asking the patient what he has used can aid in his overall management. However, this patient
does not show signs of gross intoxication or withdrawal, which would require immediate
treatment. The more critical issue is determining if he is having thoughts of harming himself or
others because this would determine the need to hold him in the emergency department.
