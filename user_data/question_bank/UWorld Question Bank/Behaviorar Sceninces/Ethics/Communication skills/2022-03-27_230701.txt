This patient with chronic fatigue, concentration difficulties, and intermittent headaches has
various nonspecific physical symptoms causing her significant distress. Patients without a
clear diagnosis can spend excessive amounts of time researching possible explanations (eg,
case reports on rare presentations). This may lead to deeply held convictions about a
diagnosis (eg, "I Know this is what | have") and demands for specific diagnostic testing (eg,
immunologic tests), which may or may not be medically indicated.

These challenging situations are often compounded by patients’ anger and frustration with
previous providers who minimized or invalidated their concerns, which lead them to seek yet
another opinion. In response to these challenging patient encounters, physicians must
practice empathy and recognize patient suffering while also adhering to standard medical
care (eg, perform evaluation prior to testing).

In this scenario, the most appropriate response opens with nonjudgmental validation of the
patient's symptoms (eg, "You want an explanation for the symptoms you're experiencing").
This is followed by outlining the standard evaluation process (eg, "since this is our first
meeting, I'd like to do a thorough evaluation"). In contrast to other approaches, this response
