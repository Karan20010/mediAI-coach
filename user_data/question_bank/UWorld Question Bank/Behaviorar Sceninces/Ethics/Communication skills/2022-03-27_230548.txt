activity.

(Choices A and C) Although this patient appears irritable and assessing his mood further is
important, this should be done with the patient alone, where he can openly describe how he is
feeling without his mother present. Although asking the mother if she has concerns about her
son's mood may provide additional information, it is unlikely to give an accurate picture of his
mood given the mother's angry frustration with his behavior.

(Choice D) This statement is likely to be perceived as judgmental and to antagonize the
mother, especially if it is delivered in front of the patient. A more productive approach is to
speak with the patient privately and model appropriate behavior in joint discussions with the
patient and mother.

Educational objective:

In situations in which a parent's presence may interfere with obtaining honest answers from an
adolescent patient, physicians should politely ask the parent to wait outside and interview the
patient privately. All adolescent visits should include an opportunity to interview the patient
alone to discuss topics such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and sexual activity.
