A 19-year-old Hispanic woman comes to the clinic due to nausea and abdominal pain. She
struggles to describe the pain and frequently points to her lower abdomen. The patient shakes
her head no when asked if she could be pregnant or is sexually active. When she is asked
about her last menstrual period, she nods affirmatively and says "now." She is single and
immigrated to the United States several months ago. Physical examination shows moderate
abdominal tenderness with no rebound or guarding and vital signs are stable. The patient is
discharged home with a diagnosis of food poisoning. Later that day, she is taken by
ambulance to the emergency department after experiencing severe abdominal pain followed
by loss of consciousness. A diagnosis of ruptured ectopic pregnancy is made. Which of the
following interventions would most likely have prevented the delay in diagnosis?

© B. Assessing the patient’s cultural health beliefs
©) C. Assessing the patient’s current social situation
