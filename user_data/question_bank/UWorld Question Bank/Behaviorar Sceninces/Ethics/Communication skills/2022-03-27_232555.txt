Educational objective:

Patients and surrogate decision-makers often have misconceptions regarding medical
conditions and the potential risks and benefits of treatment. The initial step in counseling
patients and surrogate decision-makers regarding treatment refusal is to calmly probe their
understanding of the disease process. This can be followed by counseling and education
tailored to the decision-maker's level of understanding and health literacy.
