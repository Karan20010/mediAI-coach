negative associations rather than denial of the seriousness of the illness or likelihood of
recurrence. Discussing whether she believes another event is likely would be less productive
than encouraging new, positive associations.

(Choice D) This statement attempts to universalize the patient's concern and could be helpful
for someone who is resistant to therapy due to embarrassment or shame. However, it does
not promote positive associations with the treatment and is therefore less likely to improve
adherence in this patient.

(Choice E) Focusing on adverse outcomes and complications of nonadherence is likely to
reinforce this patient's negative associations of treatment and may make her more resistant to
treatment.

Educational objective:

The psychological impact of serious illness frequently affects patients’ self-image and personal
health decisions, including medication adherence. Encouraging patients to develop positive
associations (eg, linking treatment with improved health), rather than negative associations
(eg, linking treatment with memories of disease), can improve adherence to therapy.
