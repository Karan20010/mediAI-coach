(Choices B and E) These statements reject the patient's request for more medication without
discussion and prematurely shut down the conversation. This approach is likely to frustrate
the patient, making it less likely that he will be receptive to alternate approaches to pain
management.

(Choice C) This response prematurely switches the focus of the conversation to mood,
ignoring the patient's concerns. Raising the possibility of self-medication of mood symptoms
would be more appropriate once the patient has already engaged in a collaborative discussion
of how he is using the medication.

Educational objective:

When misuse of prescription opioids is suspected, physicians should first engage patients in a
nonjudgmental, collaborative discussion to understand the reasons for the misuse.
