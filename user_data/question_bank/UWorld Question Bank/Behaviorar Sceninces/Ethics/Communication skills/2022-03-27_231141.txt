A 33-year-old man comes to the office for a routine health maintenance visit. The patient
states he wants to make sure he is taking care of his health after his father had a myocardial
infarction a few months ago at the age of 61. He has been eating healthy and exercising 3 to
4 times a week. Past medical history is noncontributory, and the patient takes no
medications. He shares that his aunt is an herbalist and recently gave him a supplement that
is supposed to help prevent cardiovascular disease. The patient asks whether it is okay to
start taking the supplement and provides a list of the ingredients, which includes herbs
unfamiliar to the physician. Which of the following is the most appropriate response?

© A. "| suggest not starting the supplement because you're already taking steps to
maintain cardiovascular health by eating healthy and exercising."

©) B. "I'll need to read more about this combination of herbs, so I'll do some research and
let you know what | find."

©) C."l'm not familiar with these herbs, but studies have shown that herbs don't have
significant effects on preventing cardiovascular disease."

©) D. "This supplement probably won't prevent cardiovascular disease, but it's likely safe
for you to take if you want to." AGiVEKE Winelons
