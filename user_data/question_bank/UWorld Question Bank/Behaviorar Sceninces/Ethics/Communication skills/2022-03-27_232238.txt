about why consistent dosing is important.

(Choice C) Serum levels of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are not routinely used. A
paroxetine level can help confirm that the patient is taking the medication but does not indicate
how much or in what way it is being taken, and does not help guide treatment. Addressing the
patient's misconceptions about the medication is preferable.

(Choices D and E) This patient has already acknowledged that she knows she should take
the medication daily. Providing oral or written instructions or recommending that she take the
medication as prescribed does not address her lack of understanding that antidepressants
should not be taken as needed and require consistent dosing to sustain efficacy.

Educational objective:

Inconsistent dosing due to patient misconceptions regarding antidepressant use can result in
loss of efficacy and the potential for toxicity and withdrawal. Physicians must assess the
patient's understanding and provide targeted education to address misconceptions.
