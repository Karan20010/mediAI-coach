listen. It is more appropriate to provide an opportunity for the patient to disclose details if she
is willing.
(Choice C) This response puts pressure on the patient to provide further details without first

assessing her willingness to divulge more about the abuse.

(Choice D) This statement expresses sympathy (feeling sorry for) rather than empathy
(understanding the patient's feelings) and redirects the conversation away from the patient's
emotional distress to screening her for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. This could
be perceived by the patient as an implicit message that the physician is not comfortable with or
willing to discuss her emotions. Asking further questions about her response to the trauma
could be appropriate later in the interview.

Educational objective:

Physicians should respond to disclosure of past sexual abuse with empathy and concern.
Clearly acknowledging the trauma and communicating a willingness to discuss it when the
patient is ready will help strengthen the physician-patient relationship.
