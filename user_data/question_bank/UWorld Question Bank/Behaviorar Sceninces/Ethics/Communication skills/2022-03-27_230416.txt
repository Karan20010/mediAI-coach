Sexual history is a key part of comprehensive patient care and should be obtained at all initial
visits, routine preventive screenings, and visits when sexually transmitted infections are
suspected. Physicians should attempt to put patients of all sexual orientations and gender
identities at ease when reviewing sexual history because, for some, the discussion may feel
uncomfortable and intrusive. Normalizing the discussion as a routine component of the
medical examination, ensuring confidentiality, remaining nonjudgmental, and expressing a
willingness to address all sexual health concerns can facilitate the discussion.

When asking about sexual partners, the physician should avoid using labels or making
assumptions about patients or their partners’ sexual orientation or gender identity. Asking an
open-ended question about all sexual partners allows patients to describe their sexual
partners and behavior in terms that they are familiar with and that reflect their gender identity.
After inquiring about the gender of sexual partners (including trans, nonbinary), the physician
can ask about pertinent types of sex (eg, vaginal, oral, anal) with each partner in order to make
testing recommendations for sexually transmitted infections (eg, HIV) and discuss risk-
reduction strategies. Another possible formulation is, "What is/are the sex and gender of your

sexual partner(s)?"
