(Choice E) This response makes the inappropriate assumption that the patient is not ready or
does not want to receive additional information during this visit. Instead, the patient should be
allowed to express the full range of her emotions and invited to ask any questions. Depending
on her response, the physician can educate her about the condition and her options.

Educational objective:

Delivering serious news requires allowing the patient time to process the information and
express emotions. Empathic, supportive communication should include acknowledging the
patient's distress and being open to answering any questions.
