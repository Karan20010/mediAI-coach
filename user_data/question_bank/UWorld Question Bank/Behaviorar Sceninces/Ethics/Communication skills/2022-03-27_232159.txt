Hearing loss is common, impacting almost 20% of US adults; the prevalence increases with

age. Hearing loss is associated with increased rates of misdiagnosis, longer lengths of

hospitalizations, and increased readmission rates. As such, physicians should employ

strategies to improve communication, which include:

Decreasing background noise

Facing the patient directly when speaking and refraining from touching the face or mouth

Speaking clearly and loudly (ie, natural amplification) without shouting or shrieking,
which distorts the sound of speech

Speaking at a normal pace because speaking too slowly can decrease contextual clues
and make it hard for patients to understand

Using short and simple sentences and addressing one topic at a time

Using facial expressions, gestures, and visual aids when appropriate
e Asking the patient to repeat back specific instructions to ensure understanding

Hearing loss patients are heterogeneous with varying needs. Physicians should ask open-
ended questions such as, "What is the best way for me to communicate with you?" and
frequently ask for feedback to ensure that communication is effective. In addition, physicians
should document successful strategies to improve future encounters.
