In this initial patient encounter, the physician is faced with a specific request for an emotional
support animal letter but has very limited information. Although physicians should be
responsive to a patient's concerns, they should not feel pressured to make a recommendation
before fully evaluating the patient. The best approach is to validate the patient's concerns
and gather more information on which to base a decision.

The physician should begin with an empathic comment acknowledging this patient's distress
and then obtain a more complete understanding of the situation. This would include obtaining
a more detailed description of the patient's mood, evaluation for additional depressive
symptoms, and medical and psychiatric history as well as an assessment of other
psychosocial stressors and the patient's support system. Dismissing the patient's request or
coming to a premature decision should be avoided.

(Choice A) This statement fails to acknowledge the patient's distress, avoids addressing her

request, and offers specific advice without a full understanding of the situation.

(Choice B) This statement dismisses the patient's immediate concern as unimportant and
focuses on long-term strategies. This approach is likely to frustrate the patient and negatively
impact the physician-patient relationship.

Choice D) This statement may make the patient feel defensive about her decision to move.
