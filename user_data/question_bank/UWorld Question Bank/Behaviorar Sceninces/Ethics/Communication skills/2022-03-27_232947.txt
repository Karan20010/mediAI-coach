This patient is struggling to quit smoking and is discouraged by repeated failures. Rather than
repeat the health risks of smoking or prematurely focus on treatment, the physician can be
more productive by using motivational interviewing to build and support the patient's motivation
to change. Motivational interviewing is a patient-centered approach that invites
collaboration, helps develop internal motivation to change, and enhances the patient's
sense of optimism, self-confidence, and self-efficacy in reaching goals.

The physician's most appropriate response is to support the patient's sense of self-efficacy by
helping her reflect on her past success and apply it to her current difficulties. By reviewing
successful methods that enabled the patient to stop using cocaine, the physician can build the
patient's internal motivation and belief that she can change her smoking habits as well.

(Choices A and D) This patient has been counseled about smoking and has tried to quit
several times. She is likely aware that stopping smoking will improve her breathing and overall

health. Rather than express concern and repeat the risks of smoking, the physician would be
more effective by eliciting the patient's perspective and exploring her concerns about the
effects of smoking on her breathing.

(Choice B) Although this statement is empathic, it prematurely focuses on treatment without

attempting to elicit the patient's strengths and build her intrinsic motivation.
