(Choice A) Many experts recommend an apology be made to the patient following an error.
However, specific blame (including self-blame) is not necessary and may make defending a
claim more difficult later.

(Choice C) This statement does not acknowledge that an error occurred and may be taken as
blaming the patient. Plans for future prevention should generally come after an open
discussion of the initial error.

(Choice D) This statement conveys superficial concern but does not acknowledge the error
and is likely to be seen as detached or blasé on the part of the clinician.

(Choice E) Although factually correct, this statement conveys no empathy for the patient. It
also deflects blame to the referring provider, which often generates distrust toward all of the
involved parties.

Educational objective:

When speaking with a patient following a medical error, clinicians should directly discuss the
error. The conversation should allow opportunity for the patient to ask questions. A plan to
rectify the error should be provided. Finally, the provider should convey concern for the patient
and remain engaged with the patient's care.
