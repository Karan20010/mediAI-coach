(Choice A) The physician's primary duty is to protect the patient's confidentiality regardless of
whether her husband is a patient or not. Imposing one's personal belief that it would be in the
husband's best interest to know is inappropriate.

(Choices B and D) These statements could be considered directive and/or judgmental by the
patient. The physician should be neutral with regard to the patient's decision and not force her
into actions or a conversation with which she may be uncomfortable. It would be appropriate
to inquire about the patient's concerns, specifically if there are any safety concerns.

(Choice C) The physician has no legal or ethical obligation to inform the biological father.
Under current law, a father has no legal right to know that a child is his unless he is ordered to
make child support payments.

Educational objective:

Patient confidentiality is strongly protected because patients must feel free to disclose details
of all aspects of their lives so that physicians can provide optimal care. Exceptions to patient
confidentiality include suspected child, disabled person, or elder abuse; knife or gunshot
wounds; diagnosis of a reportable communicable disease; and patients at risk of physically
harming themselves or others.
