(Choice D) The gastroenterologist is not required to lie to protect patient confidentiality; a
more neutral statement that neither confirms nor denies a therapeutic relationship with the
patient is sufficient.
(Choice E) To protect patient privacy, discussion of protected health information should take

place in a private location rather than a public area (eg, cafeteria, elevator). However,
because the hospitalist is not directly involved in the patient's care, the gastroenterologist
cannot discuss whether or not the patient is receiving treatment.

Educational objective:

Patient confidentiality prohibits physicians from disclosing a patient's protected health
information (eg, diagnosis, treatment) to anyone not directly involved in the patient's medical
care, including physician colleagues. Physicians should not identify their patients when it is
not medically necessary because doing so is a breach of patient privacy.
