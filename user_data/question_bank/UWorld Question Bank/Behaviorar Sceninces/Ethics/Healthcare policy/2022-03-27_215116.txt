patient's share of cost for the services they receive (eg, copayments, deductibles) and limiting

payment for services that do not meet established evidence-based guidelines.

This patient's chronic conditions require daily medications, regular physician visits, and serial
laboratory testing. In addition, diabetes can increase the risk of additional complications,
