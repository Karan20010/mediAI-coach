the patient could be undergoing a contentious divorce and not want any information released
to his wife. HIPAA does not require proof of identity if the patient has given permission to
share information.

(Choice C) Providing minimal information that the patient is "stable" would be appropriate.
This response protects the patient's privacy by not revealing the diagnosis or other medical
details, but also limits emotional harm to the patient by informing those who are likely to be
family about the patient's condition. If permission to share information is obtained later, the
physician should ask the patient whether he prefers that potentially sensitive details be omitted
(eg, if the myocardial infarction was due to cocaine use and the patient did not want this
revealed).

Educational objective:

Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, physicians may disclose patient
information to friends and family members in emergency situations or when the patient is
otherwise incapacitated, depending on what is in the best interest of the patient. Otherwise,
patient information may be disclosed only when the patient gives explicit permission or does
not object when given a reasonable opportunity.
