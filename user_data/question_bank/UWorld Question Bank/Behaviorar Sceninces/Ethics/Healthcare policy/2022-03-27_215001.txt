Medicare is a federal socialized medical insurance program that covers select individuals. It
provides health insurance for patients age 65 and older who have worked and paid into the
system (ie, have paid taxes). Individuals must also hold residence and citizenship in the
United States. Medicare also covers younger individuals with disabilities, end-stage renal
disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Medicare consists of several parts, with Part A
covering inpatient hospital visits, Part B covering a select number of outpatient services and
medical devices, Part C as an optional capitated plan with additional benefits (vision, dental),
and Part D as an optional prescription drug plan. Medicare is different from Medicaid, a state-
run medical insurance program that covers the homeless, undocumented immigrants,
pregnant women, and low-income families.

In this situation, only the disabled son would be eligible for Medicare.

(Choices A, B, C, and E) The pregnant woman, her boyfriend, and the child (when born) can
be covered by Medicaid only, not Medicare.

Educational objective:
Medicare is a federal socialized medical insurance program that covers individuals age 65 and
older who have a work history and younger individuals with disabilities.
