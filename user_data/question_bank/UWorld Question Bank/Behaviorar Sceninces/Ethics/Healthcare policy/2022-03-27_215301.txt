Confidentiality is a basic tenet of medical ethics and a prerequisite for a trusting physician-
patient relationship. Physicians are ethically obligated to protect patient privacy and
maintain confidentiality in most situations, including during interactions with other physicians

who are not directly involved in the patient's medical care.

The hospitalist has asked the gastroenterologist whether a certain man, a former neighbor and
close family friend, is being treated by the gastroenterologist. Because the inquiry is based on
personal and not professional interest or medical necessity, the most appropriate response
by the gastroenterologist is to avoid divulging the man's protected health information, such as
his diagnosis, treatment, and whether he is, in fact, the gastroenterologist's patient (Choice
A). Identifying the man as a patient and admitting to treating him could indirectly confirm a
diagnosis of colon cancer, which is a breach of patient privacy because sharing this
information is not medically necessary. Therefore, the most appropriate response is for the
physician to state that they cannot say whether or not the patient is under their care.

(Choice B) Although this statement does not directly admit to treating the patient, it insinuates
that the patient has a serious medical diagnosis, which violates patient confidentiality. In
addition, encouraging the hospitalist to "check in" with the patient is not advisable because the
patient may not wish to share his diagnosis or receive support from others at this time.
