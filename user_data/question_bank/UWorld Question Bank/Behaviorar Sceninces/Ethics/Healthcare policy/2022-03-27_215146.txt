released without the patient's authorization. Although HIPAA does not require proof of identity

to respond to callers, providers may establish their own rules for verifying identity.

(Choice D) Asking whether the patient's wife is aware that he is calling does not address the
issue at hand, which is the requirement for a release of information prior to disclosure of
medical information.

(Choice E) It would be inappropriate for the physician to ask the patient's husband about his
physical symptoms as they do not have a patient-doctor relationship at this time. Furthermore,
discussing these symptoms may inadvertently violate the patient's confidentiality.
Recommending that the husband seek medical evaluation for his symptoms would be
reasonable.

Educational objective:

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects health information by requiring
verbal or written authorization for release of information. Family members who contact the
physician for information about their relative should not be given any information about the
patient without the patient's consent.
