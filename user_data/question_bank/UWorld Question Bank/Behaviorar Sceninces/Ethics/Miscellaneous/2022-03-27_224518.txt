A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his mother due to an asthma
exacerbation. He has a history of poorly controlled asthma, with nonadherence to medication
and outpatient follow-up visits. The mother works 2 jobs to support the family and says she
has difficulty bringing the patient to appointments. Initial physical examination shows
expiratory wheezes in both lungs. The patient is given nebulized albuterol, and his breathing
improves. On repeat examination, a healing, round burn mark is seen on the back. When
asked about the burn, the patient says, "That happens when I'm bad." His mother explains
that it was an accident resulting from the boy "playing with the cigarette lighter in the car."
