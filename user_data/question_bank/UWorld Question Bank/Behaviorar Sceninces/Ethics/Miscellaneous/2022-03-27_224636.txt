provide resources to help the patient find another provider who will perform it in a timely

manner to respect the patient's autonomy.

(Choice B) Encouraging the patient to reconsider her decision is inappropriate because it
imposes the physician's own judgment and values. Discussing age-related infertility risks in
this situation can inadvertently place guilt or shame on the patient and should be avoided.

(Choice C) Encouraging the patient to take additional time to make a decision is not advisable
because this could place her past the first trimester and increase complexity/risk to the
procedure.

Educational objective:

Conscientious refusal of treatment occurs when a provider refuses to provide care due to
moral conflict. Providers who cannot, in good conscience, provide treatment that a patient
requests, are obligated to refer the patient in a timely fashion to another provider who can.
This respects the patient's autonomy.
