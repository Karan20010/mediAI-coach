A 28-year-old woman comes to the gynecologist, who has provided routine care for the patient
over the past 10 years. The patient has not menstruated for over 2 months and had a positive
home pregnancy test last week. Although she hopes to have children in the future, she has
been under a lot of stress lately and says that caring for a child is the last thing she needs right
now. A pelvic ultrasound confirms an intrauterine pregnancy at 7 weeks gestation, and the
patient requests that the gynecologist terminate the pregnancy as soon as possible. The
gynecologist does not perform abortions on moral grounds but does have training in the
procedure. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?

©) A. Agree to perform the abortion because the procedure is within the physician's scope
of training and there is a duty to provide care in a timely manner.

©) B. Discuss the risks of age-related fertility decline and encourage the patient to
reconsider because she wants to have children someday.

() C. Encourage the patient to take additional time to consider alternate options for the
pregnancy.

() D. Politely explain that on moral grounds, the physician is unable to perform the
abortion or refer the patient for an abortion.
