addition, administering a medication that could have an adverse reaction is problematic, even

if vital signs are being monitored.

(Choice C) It is appropriate to explain the risks and benefits of the medication to the patient,
who ultimately decides whether to take it. However, it is unprofessional to involve the patient
before clarifying the rationale for the attending's recommendation.

(Choice D) It is unprofessional to refuse to follow the suggestions of an attending physician
without first consulting him or her (if the attending is directly responsible for care of the patient,

as in this case).

Educational objective:
Physicians are ethically obligated to question orders that raise concern about potential harm to
patients. Issues should initially be discussed directly with the physician who made the order

and not involve ancillary staff.
