A 52-year-old woman undergoes a fine needle aspiration procedure for evaluation of a thyroid
nodule. The physician completes the biopsy successfully without complication. However, a
week later, the physician is concerned because no pathology results are seen in the electronic
medical record. Upon contacting the laboratory, the physician learns that the specimen was
never received. The physician inquires further among his staff and learns that the staff
member normally in charge of transporting specimens was absent the day the procedure was
performed, and a temporary off-site assistant had filled in for the staff member. The patient is
scheduled to come to the office the following day to receive her results. After informing the
patient of the need for a repeat procedure due to sample misplacement, which of the following
additional statements by the physician would be most appropriate?
