An 82-year-old woman is hospitalized in a busy tertiary care hospital due to fever and

shortness of breath. The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. She

is diagnosed with pneumonia and started on empiric antibiotic therapy overnight by the

admitting physician. After several days of treatment, the patient's condition deteriorates, and

she is transferred to the intensive care unit. Sputum cultures were obtained on admission, but

the results were not checked by the daytime team, resulting in a delay in initiating more

specific antibiotic treatment. Which of the following interventions would be most effective to

prevent this type of medical error?
