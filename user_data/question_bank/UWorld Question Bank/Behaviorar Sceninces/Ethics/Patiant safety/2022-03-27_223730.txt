A 46-year-old woman is hospitalized due to severe depression and fatigue. She has no other
medical problems. Routine laboratory tests are ordered and the patient is started on
antidepressant medication. After a week, her depression improves slightly and she is
discharged home to continue with outpatient care. However, the patient remains severely
fatigued and is unable to return to her job, forcing her to take a leave of absence. At her
follow-up appointment 2 weeks later, review of the hospital record by the outpatient physician
reveals a TSH level of 15.2 wU/mL that was never addressed by the inpatient physician.
Subsequent evaluation and treatment with thyroid hormone result in rapid improvement of her
depression and fatigue. Which of the following is the appropriate categorization for this type of
medical error?

A. Malpractice (18%)
B. Near miss (13%)
C. Non-preventable adverse event (0%)
