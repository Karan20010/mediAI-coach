critical information is transmitted consistently between providers.

(Choice C) Consulting an infectious disease specialist would help ensure correct antibiotic
treatment and could be appropriate in this patient depending on the clinical scenario and/or
culture results. However, this intervention is not cost-effective for every patient and therefore
would not be the most effective intervention.

(Choice D) Requiring more detailed sign-out notes provides more information on each patient
but decreases efficiency and increases the probability that important details will be
overlooked. Applying a systematic organization method to sign-out notes is a more effective
strategy to ensure that essential tasks are not neglected.

Educational objective:
Communication failures between physicians during patient handoffs are a major cause of
medical errors and can be reduced by use of a standardized handoff process including

systematic sign-out notes.
