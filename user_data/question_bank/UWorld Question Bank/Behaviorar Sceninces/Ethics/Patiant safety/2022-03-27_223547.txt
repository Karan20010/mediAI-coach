This patient has multiple risk factors for falls, including advanced age, arthritis, prior history of
falls, cognitive impairment, and use of multiple medications associated with increased risk
of falling (ie, psychotropic and cardiovascular drugs). Medication use is one of the most
modifiable risk factors for falls.

Psychotropic drugs, including antipsychotics such as aripiprazole; antidepressants, such as
sertraline and amitriptyline; and benzodiazepines are most commonly associated with
increased fall risk. Cardiovascular drugs that reduce circulating blood volume or blood
pressure such as calcium channel blockers (eg, amlodipine), beta blockers, and diuretics are
also associated with falls. The patient should undergo a medication review with the goal of
finding the lowest effective dose, eliminating unnecessary medications, and/or switching to
those associated with a lower fall risk.

(Choices A and D) Bed rails and soft physical restraints have not been shown to reduce falls
in long-term care facilities. Some studies indicate a slightly increased risk of falls and injury in
nursing home patients who are physically restrained.

(Choices B and E) Assistive devices such as canes and walkers are often used to improve
mobility in patients with gait or balance disturbances. However, there is a lack of evidence
