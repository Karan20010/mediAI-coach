Illegible orders and transcribing errors are preventable causes of medication errors. In this
case, the medication error could be due to an unclear decimal point or a transcription error.
Although the increased use of computerized physician order entry systems with drop-down
menus for drug, dose, route, and frequency has reduced the incidence of these errors, the
systems are not universally available. Physicians must write or enter orders clearly and
specifically avoid using trailing zeros to prevent errors in dosage. Studies show that
educational interventions to reduce the use of certain abbreviations (eg, QD, ug) and avoid
trailing zeros lead to a significant decrease in transcription errors.

(Choice A) Confirming the dosage with the patient may be helpful. However, it is an
inadequate double-check due to many patients being unaware of their medication dosage or in
a mental state (due to a psychiatric or medical condition) that may prevent them from thinking
clearly about it.

(Choice C) Because a particular medication may be available in different dosages,
computerized checks with automated alerts may not consistently identify a higher dosage as
an error. Computerized systems are helpful in eliminating illegible orders; identifying patients
at high risk for an adverse event; and alerting physicians to medication allergies, drug
interactions, and dosage limits.
