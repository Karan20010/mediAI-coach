Sleep deprivation is common among physicians and can have a profound effect on patient
safety. Sleep science has demonstrated "dose-dependent" effects of sleep deprivation on
physician cognitive performance and risk of medical errors. Impairments in cognitive
performance and motor skills typically manifest after 17 hours of wakefulness and are
comparable to those seen in an alcohol-intoxicated individual. Although the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education has mandated limitations on resident work hours in
response to patient safety concerns, extended work hours of attending physicians are
unregulated. Physicians typically do a poor job of self-regulating their workload, often
underestimate their cumulative sleep debt, and minimize its impact on their clinical skills. In
this scenario, the physician has been working continuously for more than 24 hours; fatigue is
the most likely contributor to his forgetting to check the patient's anion gap, which resulted in
the adverse outcome.

(Choices A, B, and D) There is no evidence that the physician lacks knowledge, had an
excessive patient caseload, or committed an error in judgment.

(Choice C) Inadequate patient handoffs carry a high risk of medical errors. Optimal patient
handoffs should include a checklist of tasks and clinical status for each patient, as occurred in
this case.
