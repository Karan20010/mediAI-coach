(Choice B) Communication with outpatient specialists is an important component of the
discharge process, but it does not help the patient manage the complex follow-up tasks
required.

(Choice C) Adischarge summary is prepared by the hospital physician to document the
hospital course and assist other medical providers and support staff in the care of the patient.
It uses technical language that may be confusing to the patient. In contrast, the discharge
instruction checklist uses simple and clear language intended to optimize patient
understanding.

(Choice E) Reviewing discharge instructions with the patient's daughter would be appropriate
if the patient lived with her or if the daughter was helping the patient obtain medication or was
providing transportation to follow-up appointments.

Educational objective:

A discharge checklist detailing medication changes and follow-up appointments can
significantly facilitate a patient's transition from the hospital and improve adherence to
outpatient treatment. Individuals who experience a smooth transition from the inpatient to the
outpatient setting are at lower risk for early rehospitalization.
