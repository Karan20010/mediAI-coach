Clear communication between health care team members is an essential component of high-
quality patient care. Errors can occur frequently when communication is unclear or vague, and
communication errors are one of the most common factors involved in malpractice claims for
medical errors.

Closed-loop communication is a form of effective communication used in health care
settings and other high-risk fields. This technique lowers the risk of misunderstandings by
ensuring clear communication. It enhances the team's ability to exchange clear, concise
information; acknowledges receipt of the information; and confirms its understanding. Closed-
loop communication typically involves an individual (the sender) transmitting a message to
another individual (the receiver), who then repeats the message back to the sender. The
sender typically will confirm the message by saying "yes".

In this situation, the nurse must repeat the order in an accurate and concise manner to convey
that the physician's message has been received. The physician should confirm by saying
"yes" following the nurse's statement to convey that this is correct.

(Choice B) Although this response conveys that the nurse has comprehended that the patient
needs diphenhydramine immediately, it does not convey the nurse’s understanding of the

correct route of administration.
