these conditions involves altered mental status, hyperthermia, or sympathetic hyperactivity.

(Choice D) Lithium is a mood stabilizer used in bipolar disorder but is not used to control
acute agitation and psychosis. Acute lithium toxicity typically begins with nausea, vomiting,
and diarrhea, with neuromuscular signs developing later.

(Choice F) Although serotonin syndrome (due to overdose or combinations of serotonergic
drugs) can also present with mental status changes, hyperthermia, and sympathetic
hyperactivity, it typically presents with neuromuscular hyperactivity (eg, clonus, hyperreflexia)
as opposed to the diffuse rigidity seen in NMS and in this patient.

Educational objective:

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an adverse reaction to antipsychotic medication
characterized by severe "lead-pipe" rigidity, hyperthermia, sympathetic hyperactivity, and
mental status changes. NMS is characterized by severe rigidity rather than the neuromuscular
irritability (eg, hyperreflexia, myoclonus) seen in serotonin syndrome.
