Question Id: 2045

A 25-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by ambulance after being found
sitting in the street drinking his own urine. The patient's mother says that a year ago he
expressed the belief that he was being watched by an unidentified government agency and
subsequently broke up with his girlfriend, quit his job, and disconnected his phone. The
patient's mother has noticed that he no longer seems to care about activities that used to
interest him, and last month she found out that he had moved into the family garden shed with
his dog. On examination, the patient is malodorous, disheveled, and laughs for no apparent
reason. He later becomes angry and refuses to sit in a chair for the interview. The patient
switches among unrelated topics and when asked where he lives says, "in the holy buffet of
diplomacy." Temperature is 36.7 C (98 F), blood pressure is 122/79 mm Hg, and pulse is
80/min. Physical examination and laboratory evaluation, including urine toxicology, are
unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

©) A. Bipolar | disorder

©) B. Brief psychotic disorder

|) C. Major depression with psychotic features

-) D. Psychotic disorder due to a general medical condition
