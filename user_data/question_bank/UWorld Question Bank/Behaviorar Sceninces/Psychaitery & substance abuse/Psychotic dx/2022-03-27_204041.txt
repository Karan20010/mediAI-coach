Question Id: 513

This patient likely has developed amenorrhea and galactorrhea as an adverse effect of
dopamine-2 (D2) receptor blockade from treatment with antipsychotics. There are 4 major
dopaminergic pathways in the brain (eg, mesolimbic, mesocortical, tuberoinfundibular,
nigrostriatal); dopamine hyperactivity in the mesolimbic pathway is associated with positive
psychotic symptoms (eg hallucinations, delusions).

The side effects of antipsychotic therapy are largely caused by D2 receptor blockade in other
dopaminergic pathways. The tuberoinfundibular pathway connects the hypothalamus to the
pituitary gland and is responsible for the tonic inhibition of prolactin secretion. Neurons in the
arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus secrete dopamine, which binds to D2 receptors on
pituitary lactotrophs, resulting in decreased prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary
gland. Antipsychotics can interrupt the tuberoinfundibular pathway, causing increased blood
prolactin levels (hyperprolactinemia), which may lead to galactorrhea (milky nipple
discharge unrelated to pregnancy/breastfeeding) and menstrual irregularities (eg,
amenorrhea).

(Choice A) The arcuate fasciculus is a neural pathway that connects the Broca and Wernicke

areas, which are responsible for expressive and receptive language, respectively. Disruption
of the arcuate fasciculus classically results in conduction aphasia, characterized by fluent
