Question Id: 2045

(Choices B and G) Brief psychotic disorder is characterized by acute onset of psychotic
symptoms lasting 21 day but <1 month, with full return to premorbid level of functioning.
Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished from schizophrenia by a symptom duration of >1
month and <6 months. Because this patient's symptoms have lasted 26 months, he meets the
criteria for schizophrenia.

(Choice D) Although it is important to definitively rule out medical causes of psychosis, this
patient's normal vital signs and unremarkable physical examination and laboratory evaluation

make a primary psychiatric disorder more likely.

(Choice E) Schizoaffective disorder requires that the patient meet the criteria for a major
depressive or manic episode concurrent with active-phase symptoms of schizophrenia. The
diagnosis also requires that delusions or hallucinations occur in the absence of mood
symptoms for 22 weeks at some point during the illness.

Educational objective:

The diagnosis of schizophrenia requires 22 of the following 5 symptoms: delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized behavior, and negative symptoms.
The total impairment duration must be 26 months.
