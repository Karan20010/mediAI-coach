Question Id: 222

This patient with amenorrhea and breast tenderness likely has drug-induced
hyperprolactinemia due to risperidone, an antipsychotic drug used in the management of
schizophrenia. Its primary action is to inhibit dopamine D2 receptors, but it also has
inhibitory effects on serotonergic and alpha-adrenergic pathways.

Secretion of prolactin from the anterior pituitary is primarily regulated by the inhibitory effect of
hypothalamic dopamine; stimulation of D2 receptors on lactotrophs decreases the synthesis
and release of prolactin. Because risperidone and other antipsychotic drugs block D2 receptor
activation, there is a loss of the normal tonic inhibition of prolactin release, leading to
hyperprolactinemia in some cases. This can result in galactorrhea and breast soreness. In
addition, elevated prolactin levels inhibit release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from the

hypothalamus, resulting in central hypogonadism and amenorrhea.

(Choice A) Nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may be associated with menstrual
irregularity (most often oligomenorrhea), hirsutism, and acne in women. Nonclassic 21-
hydroxylase deficiency most often presents in childhood or adolescence.

(Choice B) Asherman syndrome refers to the presence of severe intrauterine adhesions that
cause amenorrhea and infertility. It typically occurs in patients who have had multiple dilation

and curettage procedures or those with chronic endometritis.
