symptoms are better explained by a medical condition, such as progressive dementia.
(Choice C) Major depression with psychotic features is a subtype of major depressive
disorder characterized by very severe depressive symptoms and delusions and/or
hallucinations consistent with depressive themes (eg, guilt, worthlessness). This patient has

insufficient depressive symptoms to diagnose an episode of major depressive disorder; his
apathy and deterioration in personal hygiene are consistent with AD.

(Choice E) Some medications (eg, corticosteroids, dopamine agonists) can induce psychotic
symptoms and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of new-onset psychotic
symptoms. This patient's medications are not known to induce psychosis, and his symptoms
are better explained by AD.

Educational objective:
Psychotic symptoms (eg, delusions, hallucinations) are common in Alzheimer disease and
increase with the severity of illness.
