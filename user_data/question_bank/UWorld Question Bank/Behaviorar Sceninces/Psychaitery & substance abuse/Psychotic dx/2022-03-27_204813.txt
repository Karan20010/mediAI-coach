muscle spasm in his neck that developed several days after starting treatment with

haloperidol. He is extremely distressed and unable to turn his head. The patient is treated

with intravenous diphenhydramine, which relieves his symptoms within minutes. A psychiatrist

is consulted, and recommendations are made to discontinue haloperidol and start the second-

generation antipsychotic quetiapine because of its lower risk for similar dystonic side effects.
