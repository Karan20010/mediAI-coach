schizophrenia, clozapine would be the preferred agent.

(Choice B) Chlorpromazine is a low-potency, first-generation antipsychotic that is unlikely to
be effective in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

(Choice C) Clonazepam is a benzodiazepine that can be used adjunctively to target agitation
in individuals with psychosis, but it does not specifically treat psychotic symptoms.

(Choice E) Haloperidol long-acting injectable would be a good strategy for a patient who is
nonadherent and has a history of responding well to oral haloperidol. However, this patient is
adherent and has responded poorly to haloperidol.

(Choice F) Valproate is an anticonvulsant mood stabilizer used in the treatment of bipolar
disorder.

Educational objective:

The antipsychotic clozapine is the drug of choice for treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
Treatment requires monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due to the risks of neutropenia
and agranulocytosis.
