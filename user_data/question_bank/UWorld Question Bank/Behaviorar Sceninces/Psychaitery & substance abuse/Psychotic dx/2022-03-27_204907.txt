Question Id: 512

This patient is experiencing a manic episode with psychotic features and most likely received
multiple doses of antipsychotic medication to control his agitation in the emergency
department. His hyperthermia, sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, diaphoresis, tachycardia),
severe muscle rigidity (frequently described as "lead-pipe rigidity"), and altered mental
status are characteristic of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

NMS is a potentially life-threatening adverse reaction to antipsychotics (ie, neuroleptics) that
typically presents 1-3 days after initiation or dose escalation. It is thought to be caused by
antagonism of central dopaminergic systems involved in thermoregulation and regulation of
muscle tone and movement. Treatment involves cessation of the causative agent;
benzodiazepines and dantrolene (a postsynaptic muscle relaxant) are used for treating

severe cases.

(Choices A, B, and C) Antipsychotic D2 dopamine receptor antagonism in the nigrostriatal
pathway can cause a variety of reactions (known as extrapyramidal symptoms) that can be
confused with NMS. Acute dystonic reactions involve distressing contractions of the neck,
mouth, and tongue. Akathisia is a subjective feeling of intense restlessness and an inability to
sit still. Drug-induced parkinsonism manifests as rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. None of
these conditions involves altered mental status, hyperthermia, or sympathetic hyperactivity.
