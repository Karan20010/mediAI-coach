(Choice D) Although a baseline ECG is required and physicians should be alert to the
development of cardiovascular symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, routine ECGs are not
required. Among the second-generation antipsychotics, ziprasidone is most often noted for
causing a prolonged QT interval.

(Choices E and F) Liver function tests may be mildly elevated with the use of many
psychotropic medications, including antipsychotics and anticonvulsants; thrombocytopenia can
be caused by some anticonvulsants. However, routine monitoring of liver function tests and

platelets is not required with clozapine.

(Choice G) Prolactin levels are not routinely monitored. Among the second-generation
antipsychotics, risperidone has been associated with a greater risk of prolactin elevation.

Educational objective:
Patients treated with clozapine are required to have regular monitoring of the absolute
neutrophil count due to the risk of life-threatening agranulocytosis.
