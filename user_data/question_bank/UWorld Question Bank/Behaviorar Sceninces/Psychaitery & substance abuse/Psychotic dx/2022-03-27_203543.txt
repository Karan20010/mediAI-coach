Schizophrenia is a chronic psychotic illness with typical onset in early adulthood (peak age:
men, early 20s; women, late 20s). Although the disease is chronic, the level of morbidity that
those with schizophrenia experience can be dictated by types of symptoms, psychosocial
influences, and health care interventions. Notable favorable prognostic factors include:

¢ Early intervention

¢ Presence of a multidisciplinary care team (eg, case manager, psychiatrist)

¢ Limited extent of external stressors (eg, trauma, conflict)

¢ Favorable socioeconomic circumstances

¢ Symptom types (positive > negative)
Patients with predominantly positive psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, delusions),
such as this patient, tend to have a more favorable prognosis than patients with
predominantly negative symptoms (eg, flat affect, loss of motivation, anhedonia). This is
because antipsychotic medications are more effective for treating positive psychotic
symptoms than negative symptoms. Early intervention with antipsychotic medication to
decrease the duration of active psychosis also improves the course of illness.
