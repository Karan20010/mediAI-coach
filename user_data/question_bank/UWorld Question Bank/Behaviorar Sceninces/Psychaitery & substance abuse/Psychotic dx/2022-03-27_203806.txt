An 82-year-old man is brought to the office by his daughter due to behavioral changes. She
reports that over the past year her father has become increasingly paranoid and frequently
talks out loud as if in conversation when no one else is present. The daughter says, "During a
recent argument, he accused me of being an imposter and stealing his personal items. Also,
he used to be very clean, but his personal hygiene has gotten really bad. He also stopped
watching baseball, which used to be his favorite hobby." The patient's medical history is
significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Medications
include lisinopril, simvastatin, and metformin. The patient has been unable to live
independently for the past 2 years due to increasing forgetfulness and an inability to perform
self-care. Vital signs are stable, and physical examination and laboratory evaluation are
unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's behavior?

© A. Alzheimer disease
©) B. Delusional disorder
©) C. Major depression with psychotic features

©) D. Schizophrenia
