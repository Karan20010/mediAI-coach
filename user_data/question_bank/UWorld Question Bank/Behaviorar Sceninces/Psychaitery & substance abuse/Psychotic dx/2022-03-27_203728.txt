(Choice C) Closing window blinds during the day restricts the ability of the intrinsic circadian
system to synchronize with the 24-hour day, which disrupts the sleep-wake cycle and
increases delirium risk.

(Choice D) Removing hearing aids contributes to disorientation and sensory deprivation, thus
increasing delirium risk. Providing hearing aids helps reduce delirium incidence.

(Choice E) Nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pain management is desirable because opioids
frequently precipitate delirium. However, postsurgical pain also significantly increases delirium
risk and typically requires pharmacologic treatment.

Educational objective:

Because disruption of the sleep-wake cycle is both a risk factor and manifestation of delirium,
facilitation of nocturnal sleep (eg, minimizing noise & patient interventions, appropriate
day/night lighting) is helpful for delirium prevention and management.
