This patient likely has schizophrenia, a chronic mental illness characterized by delusions,
hallucinations, disorganized speech and behavior, and negative symptoms. Antipsychotic
medication is the treatment of choice. This patient is considered treatment-resistant as he has
had a poor response to at least 2 antipsychotics and continues to experience multiple
delusions and disorganized speech and behavior. The second-generation antipsychotic
clozapine is the only medication that has consistently shown superior efficacy in treatment-
resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine has an affinity for multiple dopamine and serotonin
receptors, but the precise pharmacological mechanism responsible for its superior efficacy is
unknown.

Treatment with clozapine involves mandatory monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count due
to the risk of neutropenia and life-threatening agranulocytosis. Although clozapine is
associated with neutropenia, weight gain, and metabolic effects, the potential benefit of
improving symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia often outweighs these risks.
(Choices A and G) Aripiprazole and ziprasidone are second-generation antipsychotics used
in schizophrenia. However this patient has already failed 2 trials with second-generation
antipsychotics (risperidone and quetiapine). Due to its superior efficacy in treatment-resistant
schizophrenia, clozapine would be the preferred agent.
