A 32-year-old man with schizophrenia comes to the office for follow-up. The patient has been
stable on his antipsychotic medication for many years. He has infrequent auditory
hallucinations and says that the medication "has helped a lot to turn down the volume of the
voices." The patient works stocking grocery shelves part-time and lives with his parents, who

are supportive. His symptoms first developed gradually at age 14 when he exhibited
nonspecific anxiety and became increasingly paranoid that others were talking about him
behind his back; he also became preoccupied with finding special meanings in certain
numbers. A year later he was hospitalized for a psychotic episode characterized by paranoid
delusions and auditory hallucinations that responded rapidly to antipsychotic medication. The
patient was able to finish high school. He was hospitalized again briefly at age 22 but has
remained out of the hospital since then. Which of the following factors is most predictive of a
favorable prognosis for this patient?

() A. Gradual onset of symptoms
©) B. Lack of precipitating event
© C. Male sex

() D. Onset before the age of 20 Activate Windows
