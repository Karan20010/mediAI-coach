(Choice C) Routine ECG monitoring is not required with antipsychotic treatment unless the
patient has known pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors (eg, long QT syndrome). Among
SGAs, ziprasidone is most often associated with QT prolongation.

(Choice E) Although antipsychotics can cause prolactin elevation due to D2 receptor
antagonism in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, prolactin levels are not routinely monitored
unless the patient has symptoms of prolactin dysfunction (eg, galactorrhea, sexual
impairment). Among SGAs, risperidone has been associated with a greater risk of prolactin
elevation.

Educational objective:

As a class, second-generation antipsychotics are associated with metabolic adverse effects
(eg, weight gain, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, increased risk of diabetes). Within the class,
olanzapine and clozapine carry the greatest risk.
