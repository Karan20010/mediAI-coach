—— Question Id: 511

This patient has a diagnosis of schizophrenia and has likely been treated with antipsychotic
medications for many years. Her abnormal movements are characteristic of tardive
dyskinesia (TD), a movement disorder associated with long-term treatment with dopamine
antagonist medications (eg, antipsychotics, metoclopramide). Possible mechanisms of TD
include development of hypersensitive post-synaptic D2 receptors following prolonged D2
blockade and an imbalance between D1 and D2 receptor-mediated effects.

TD typically consists of repetitive, rhythmic, involuntary movements of the tongue, lips,
face, trunk, and extremities. Orofacial dyskinesias (eg, facial grimacing, tongue movements,
lip smacking and puckering) are most common, but choreoathetoid movements of the trunk
and limbs can also occur. Older age and exposure to first-generation antipsychotics increase
the risk of developing TD. Treatment typically includes discontinuing the offending agent when

feasible.

(Choices A, C, and D) TD can be differentiated from acute extrapyramidal syndromes that
also result from exposure to dopamine antagonists. Acute dystonia involves a distressing,
sustained, involuntary contraction of the neck, mouth, tongue, or eye muscles that typically
occurs within the first few days of receiving a dopamine antagonist. Akathisia is characterized
by physical restlessness, difficulty sitting still, and a compelling need to move. Drug-induced
