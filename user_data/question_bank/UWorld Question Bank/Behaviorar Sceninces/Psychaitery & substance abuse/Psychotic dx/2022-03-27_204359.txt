This patient likely has schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder with a prevalence of 1 percent
worldwide. Her auditory hallucinations and delusions of being poisoned and receiving signals
are characteristic positive symptoms of the disorder. Positive psychotic symptoms are
thought to be caused by an excess of dopamine in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway.
The mesolimbic pathway projects from the ventral tegmental area to various regions
throughout the limbic system.

The treatment of choice for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication. Most antipsychotics are
dopamine antagonists that produce their therapeutic effects (ie, decreased intensity of
delusions and hallucinations) by decreasing dopamine activity in the mesolimbic pathway
(Choice A). Dopamine antagonism in the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways
accounts for some of the common side effects of antipsychotics.

(Choices B and E) The nigrostriatal pathway extends from the substantia nigra to the basal
ganglia and is involved in the coordination of movement. Decreased dopamine activity in the
nigrostriatal pathway causes the extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotics (eg, acute
dystonic reactions, akathisia, drug-induced parkinsonism). Increased dopamine activity in the
nigrostriatal pathway is thought to be involved in some movement disorders such as chorea

and tics.
