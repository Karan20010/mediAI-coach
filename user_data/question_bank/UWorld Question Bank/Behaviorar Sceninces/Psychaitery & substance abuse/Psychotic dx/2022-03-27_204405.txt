(Choices C and F) The tuberoinfundibular dopamine pathway projects from the

hypothalamus to the pituitary gland. Normally, neurons in the tuberoinfundibular pathway

secrete dopamine, which inhibits prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland.

Antipsychotics can cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking the inhibition of dopamine activity in

the tuberoinfundibular pathway, resulting in amenorrhea, galactorrhea, gynecomastia, and

sexual dysfunction.

Educational objective:

Positive symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, delusions, hallucinations) are associated with
increased activity of dopamine in the mesolimbic pathway. Antipsychotics work by
antagonizing dopamine receptors in this pathway.
