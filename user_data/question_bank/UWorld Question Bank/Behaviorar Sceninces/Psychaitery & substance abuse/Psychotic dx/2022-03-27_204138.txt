This patient's psychotic episode was most likely treated with an antipsychotic, and his current

symptoms are consistent with drug-induced parkinsonism, an extrapyramidal side effect of

antipsychotics. Symptoms include rigidity (may be experienced as subjective stiffness),

resting/postural tremor, masked facies, and bradykinesia and typically occur within the first

3 months of drug initiation. Other extrapyramidal side effects of antipsychotic medications

include acute dystonia (sudden, sustained contraction of muscle groups) and akathisia

(subjective restlessness and inability to sit still).

Drug-induced parkinsonism is caused by dopamine (D2) receptor blockade in the
nigrostriatal pathway. If the antipsychotic cannot be reduced or discontinued, drug-induced
parkinsonism is best treated with a centrally acting anticholinergic agent (eg, benztropine).
Levodopa should not be used to treat antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism as it can exacerbate
or even precipitate psychosis (Choice E).

(Choice B) Dantrolene is a direct-acting skeletal muscle relaxant used in the treatment of
neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS presents with diffuse muscle rigidity, high fever,
sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, hypertension, tachycardia), and altered mental status and is
unlikely in this oriented, afebrile patient with normal vital signs.

(Choices C and F) The benzodiazepine diazepam and the beta blocker propranolol may both
