First-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), also known as typical or conventional antipsychotics,
are effective in treating schizophrenia and psychosis due to other causes. FGAs are classified
according to potency, which refers to the dose required to produce an effect. Low-potency
FGAs primarily cause histaminergic, cholinergic, and noradrenergic blockade side
effects. These drugs are highly sedating and often cause anticholinergic side effects and
orthostatic hypotension. High-potency FGAs are associated primarily with extrapyramidal
symptoms (eg, dystonia, akathisia, parkinsonism) due to potent D2 dopamine receptor

antagonism in the nigrostriatal pathway.

This patient's medication was changed from a low-potency FGA (chlorpromazine) to a high-
potency FGA (fluphenazine). Muscular rigidity, an extrapyramidal side effect, is seen in drug-
induced parkinsonism; it is more likely to occur with a high-potency agent.

(Choices A, C, and G) Constipation, dry mouth, and urinary retention are anticholinergic side
effects due to cholinergic receptor blockade. They are more common with low-potency
antipsychotics. Other anticholinergic side effects include blurred vision and impaired cognitive

function.

(Choice B) Dizziness and orthostatic hypotension are due to alpha-1 adrenergic blockade
and are more common with low-potency FGAs. Orthostatic hypotension is particularly
