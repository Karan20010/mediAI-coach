Delirium is a common confusional state characterized by altered consciousness and
cognitive disturbances such as disorientation or altered perception (eg, hallucinations,
delusions). The key features of acute onset and fluctuating course distinguish it from other
cognitive (eg, dementia) and perception (eg, psychosis) disorders. Delirium most commonly
affects patients with predisposing risk factors (eg, advanced age, dementia, sensory
impairment).

Because sleep-wake cycle disruption can be both a risk factor as well as a manifestation of
delirium, facilitation of nocturnal sleep is helpful in prevention and management. Delirium
and sleep disturbances are both significantly increased by the hospital environment (eg,
ambient noise, frequent awakenings). Minimizing noise and patient interventions at night
promotes uninterrupted sleep, and physiologically appropriate lighting (ie, bright day/dim night)
helps maintain circadian alignment. These measures significantly decrease delirium incidence
and sedative-hypnotic use (an additional delirium risk factor).

(Choice B) Benzodiazepines have a limited role in the treatment of delirium because they
frequently precipitate or prolong (rather than resolve) it. They are most useful in the setting of
alcohol withdrawal (which can cause hallucinations but would also cause abnormal vital signs).

(Choice C) Closing window blinds during the day restricts the ability of the intrinsic circadian
