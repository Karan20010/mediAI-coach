This patient's 2-week history of hearing voices and paranoid delusions is consistent with brief
psychotic disorder. Onset is typically sudden in response to an overwhelming stressor.
Diagnosis requires 21 psychotic symptoms (ie, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized
speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior) lasting >1 day and <1 month with
eventual return to premorbid functioning. The diagnosis requires ruling out psychosis
secondary to a mood disorder and psychosis due to substances or a medical condition.

Symptom duration is a key feature in differentiating brief psychotic disorder from other
psychotic disorders. If this patient's symptoms were to continue for >1 month but <6 months,
the diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder would be indicated (Choice G). If the symptoms
were to continue for 26 months, the accurate diagnosis would be schizophrenia (Choice F).

(Choice A) Acute stress disorder is characterized by symptoms of intrusion (eg, flashbacks),
negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, and arousal that occur in the initial month after
exposure to a life-threatening traumatic event.

(Choice B) Bipolar disorder can present with psychotic features; however, this patient lacks
other characteristic manic symptoms (eg, elated mood, increased energy, pressured speech,

decreased need for sleep, grandiosity).
