cogwheel rigidity, masked facies, bradykinesia, tremor, and decreased arm swing. Treatment
is usually with anticholinergics (eg, benztropine).

(Choice D) Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an acute, potentially fatal reaction to
antipsychotic medications. Patients have hyperthermia, sympathetic hyperactivity (eg,
tachycardia, diaphoresis), severe "lead pipe" rigidity, and altered mental status.

(Choice E) This patient reports that her auditory hallucinations have resolved and shows no
other signs of psychosis. The physical restlessness of akathisia may be mistaken for
psychotic agitation. It is important to differentiate the two etiologies as increasing the
antipsychotic dose will further exacerbate akathisia.

(Choice F) Tardive dyskinesia is an involuntary and potentially irreversible movement disorder
due to prolonged antipsychotic exposure (typically years). Characteristic movements include
lip smacking, biting, grimacing, tongue protrusions, and choreoathetoid movements of the
head, limbs, and trunk.

Educational objective:

Akathisia is an extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic medication characterized by inner
restlessness and an inability to sit or stand in one position. Treatment involves a reduction in
the antipsychotic dose, if possible, or the addition of a beta blocker or benzodiazepine.
