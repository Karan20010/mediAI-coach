(Choices C and F) Personality disorders involve persistent patterns of behavior usually
arising in early adulthood. They are pervasive across a broad range of situations (eg,
interpersonal, vocational) but do not involve specific delusions (eg, persistent false, fixed
beliefs). Paranoid personality disorder is characterized by overarching suspiciousness or
distrust (eg, if this patient were generally distrustful of many people, including the chemical
plant workers, but did not have fixed beliefs that they were poisoning him). Schizotypal
personality disorder is characterized by eccentric behavior and odd thoughts and perceptions

but no clear delusions.

(Choices D and E) Schizophrenia (26 months) and schizophreniform disorder (21 month and
<6 months) are characterized by 22 of the following: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized
speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, and negative symptoms. In contrast,
patients with delusional disorder have delusions but no other psychotic symptoms.

Educational objective:

Delusional disorder is characterized by 21 delusions for 21 months in the absence of other
psychotic symptoms. Behavior is not obviously bizarre, and functioning is not significantly
impaired apart from the direct impact of the delusions.
