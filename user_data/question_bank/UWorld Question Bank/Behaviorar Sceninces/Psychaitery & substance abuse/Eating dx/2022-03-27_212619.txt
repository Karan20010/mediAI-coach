This patient's low body weight, distorted body perception, and findings consistent with self-
induced vomiting (pharyngeal erythema, parotid hypertrophy) are suggestive of anorexia
nervosa. Significantly low body weight (BMI <18.5 kg/m: in adults) is a core feature of
anorexia nervosa and is accompanied by a distorted body image and fear of weight gain.
There are two subtypes of anorexia. In the restricting subtype, patients fast and exercise
excessively but do not purge. In the binge eating/purging subtype, patients engage in
vomiting and/or use substances (laxatives, enemas, or diuretics) to avoid weight gain.

Findings on physical examination in AN include emaciation, bradycardia, hypotension,
hypothermia, hair loss, dry skin, lanugo (fine, downy body hair), and abdominal distension. In
the purging subtype, hypokalemia and alkalosis are often present due to repetitive vomiting.

(Choice B) In body dysmorphic disorder, patients display a preoccupation with a perceived or
slight bodily defect. Dysmorphic disorder is not diagnosed when body distortion is
accompanied by symptoms of an eating disorder (eg, low body weight, fear of weight gain).

(Choice C) Discrete periods of uncontrollable eating, with subsequent compensatory behavior
(laxatives, diuretics, vomiting, excessive exercise), occur in bulimia nervosa. However,
patients with this condition have a normal or increased body weight (in comparison with AN in

which weight is significantly decreased).
