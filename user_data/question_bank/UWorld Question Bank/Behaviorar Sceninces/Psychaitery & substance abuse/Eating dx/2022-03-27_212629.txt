(Choice D) Although constipation (hypoactive bowel sounds) and fatigue can also be seen in
hypothyroidism, this patient's low weight, fear of gaining weight, distorted body image, and
purging make anorexia nervosa more likely.

(Choice E) Irritable bowel syndrome presents with chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel
habits (diarrhea, constipation, or mixed-type). Patients often have abdominal bloating. This
diagnosis would not explain signs of purging, distorted body image, and significantly low
weight.

(Choice F) This patient does not meet the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder.
Her depressed mood, fatigue, and poor concentration are consistent with the effects of
malnutrition.

Educational objective:

Anorexia nervosa is characterized by a distorted body image and fear of weight gain despite
significantly low body weight. Patients may restrict their food intake and/or binge and purge.
The key in distinguishing anorexia nervosa from bulimia nervosa is abnormally low body
weight.
