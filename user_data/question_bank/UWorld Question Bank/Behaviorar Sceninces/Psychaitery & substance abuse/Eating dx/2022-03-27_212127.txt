This patient's history of recurrent binge eating followed by compensatory exercise—
accompanied by physical findings and laboratory values suggestive of self-induced vomiting
(pharyngeal erythema, parotid enlargement, hypokalemia and hyperamylasemia)—is
consistent with bulimia nervosa. Other findings seen in bulimia include hypotension,
tachycardia, dry skin, menstrual irregularities, erosion of dental enamel, and metabolic
alkalosis.

Treatment options for bulimia nervosa include nutritional rehabilitation (establishing a
structured and consistent meal pattern), cognitive-behavioral therapy, and pharmacotherapy
with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Fluoxetine is considered the drug of
choice and has the best evidence of being most effective in combination with nutritional
rehabilitation and psychotherapy.

(Choice A) The antidepressant bupropion is a norepinephrine dopamine reuptake inhibitor
that is contraindicated in bulimia nervosa due to elevated risk of seizures.

(Choice B) Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine are not first-line treatment for
bulimia nervosa.

(Choice D) The amphetamine lisdexamfetamine has been used to treat binge eating disorder,

but not bulimia nervosa.
