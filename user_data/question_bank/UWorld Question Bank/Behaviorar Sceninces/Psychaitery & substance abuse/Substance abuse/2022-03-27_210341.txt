(Choice C) Increased activity of alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the CNS decreases
sympathetic output and results in peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, and reduced
blood pressure.
(Choice D) Increased activation of the opioid mu receptor occurs with opioid intoxication. It

would lead to somnolence with shallow breathing and a decreased respiratory rate.
Bradycardia, rather than tachycardia, would be expected.

(Choice E) Serotonin syndrome is caused by overactivation of 5-HT receptors. Although it
also results in increased sympathetic activity, it is caused by use of serotonergic agents (eg,
SSRIs) rather than alcohol use.

Educational objective:

Chronic alcohol use downregulates inhibitory GABA receptors and upregulates excitatory
NMDA glutamate receptors. Therefore, sudden cessation of alcohol leads to decreased GABA
activity and increased glutamate activity, resulting in CNS overexcitation (eg, agitation,
disorientation, tremulousness, autonomic hyperactivity).
