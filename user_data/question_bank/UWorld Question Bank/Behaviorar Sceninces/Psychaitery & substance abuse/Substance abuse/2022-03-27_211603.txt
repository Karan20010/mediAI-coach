(Choice B) Carbamazepine may have a role in outpatient management of mild alcohol

withdrawal, but there is insufficient evidence for its use in moderate to severe alcohol
withdrawal.

(Choices C and D) Chlorpromazine and haloperidol are antipsychotic medications that lower
the seizure threshold. They should not be used to treat alcohol withdrawal as these patients
are already at significant risk for seizure.

(Choice F) Phenobarbital is a barbiturate anticonvulsant that enhances GABA activity. It is no
longer used as first-line treatment for alcohol withdrawal because it has a worse safety profile
than benzodiazepines.

(Choice G) The beta blocker propranolol can treat tremor, tachycardia, and hypertension, but
it has not been shown to prevent development of seizures or delirium tremens. Treatment with
benzodiazepines is the most crucial step in the management of alcohol withdrawal.

Educational objective:

Alcohol withdrawal should be considered in hospitalized patients who develop tremulousness,

agitation, and elevated pulse and blood pressure within 48 hours following admission.
Benzodiazepines act as a substitute for the effects of alcohol on GABA receptors, preventing

alcohol withdrawal from occuring.
