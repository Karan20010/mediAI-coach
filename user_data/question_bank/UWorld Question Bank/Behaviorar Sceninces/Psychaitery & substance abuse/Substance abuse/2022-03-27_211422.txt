Question Id: 20736

A 35-year-old woman is hospitalized following a high-speed motor vehicle collision in which
she was an unrestrained passenger. She sustained multiple deep lacerations on her
extremities, rib contusions, and a complex humerus fracture requiring surgical fixation. Over
the next 2 days, the patient's pain is treated with oral morphine every 6 hours and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every 4 hours. Her pain is controlled with this regimen but
recurs if the interval between morphine doses is extended to 8 hours. The patient is otherwise
medically stable for discharge. She is concerned about continuing to use narcotics at home to
treat her pain because her cousin had a history of opioid use disorder and passed away
several years earlier due to an overdose. Which of the following actions by the physician is
most appropriate?

©) A. Administer opioids transdermally rather than orally to reduce addiction risk
©) B. Continue opioid therapy but monitor the patient in the hospital
() C. Recommend benzodiazepines as they are less likely to result in addiction

() D. Recommend NSAIDs only for pain control given the patient's high risk of addiction

©) E. Prescribe a brief course of opioids to be used only for breakthrough pain
