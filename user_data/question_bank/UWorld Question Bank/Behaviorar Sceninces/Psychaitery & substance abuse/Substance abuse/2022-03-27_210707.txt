This patient's initial symptoms (eg, lethargy, ataxia, disorientation, slurred speech) followed by
rapid improvement and a perioral and perinasal rash on examination are most likely due to
inhalant use disorder. Inhalants, in the form of glue, toluene, nitrous oxide, amyl nitrite, and
spray paints, are often the first drugs that adolescents misuse as they are inexpensive and
readily available. They may be inhaled from a saturated cloth held near the face, from a bag
placed over the nose and mouth, or by sniffing directly. A dermatitis known as "glue sniffer's
rash" may be seen around the mouth or nostrils of chronic users.

Inhalants cause immediate effects as they are highly lipid soluble and act as CNS
depressants. They can produce brief transient euphoria, lethargy, disorientation, loss of
consciousness, poor coordination, and slurred speech. Effects typically last 15-45

minutes. Severe complications include cardiac dysrhythmias, dangerous behavior, seizures,
and death. Nitrous oxide misuse in particular is associated with vitamin B,, deficiency and
resultant symptoms of polyneuropathy (eg, symmetric numbness, gait abnormalities).
(Choices A and B) Although alcohol and benzodiazepine use can cause similar mental status

changes, this patient's rapid improvement and facial rash are more consistent with inhalant
use disorder. Alcohol and benzodiazepine intoxication would likely result in a significantly

longer period of intoxication.
