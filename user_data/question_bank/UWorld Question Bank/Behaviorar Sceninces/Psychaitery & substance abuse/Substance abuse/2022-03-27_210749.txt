An 18-year-old woman comes to the office to discuss her pain medication. Five months ago,
the patient fractured her vertebrae in a ski accident, requiring surgery and prolonged
postsurgical rehabilitation. Since the accident, she has been prescribed
hydrocodone/acetaminophen 4 times a day for pain. The patient's pain is adequately
controlled and does not interfere with day-to-day activities. Over the past month, she has tried
to stop the medication, but each time, she develops rhinorrhea, lacrimation, and vomiting,
requiring her to take it to relieve the discomfort. The patient has reduced
hydrocodone/acetaminophen intake from 4 to 3 times daily and cannot reduce it further due to
these symptoms. She is anxious and frustrated about not being able to discontinue it. Urine
drug screen is positive for hydrocodone only. A review of the state prescription drug
monitoring database reveals no other controlled substances or irregularities. Which of the
following best describes this patient's condition?
