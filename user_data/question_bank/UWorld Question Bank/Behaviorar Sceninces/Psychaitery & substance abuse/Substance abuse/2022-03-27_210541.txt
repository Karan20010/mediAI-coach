Methadone is a mu-opioid receptor agonist used for maintenance treatment of opioid use
disorder. It has a long half-life, which allows it to effectively suppress cravings and withdrawal
symptoms. Like all opioid medications, methadone carries a risk of overdose, which is
characterized by somnolence, miosis, and respiratory depression (ie, bradypnea). Another
side effect is QTc prolongation, which can predispose to torsade de pointes.

Methadone is extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system, particularly by
CYP3A4. In this case, the patient likely received fluconazole, an antifungal medication that is
used in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis (which typically occurs in patients with a
CD4 count <100 cells/uL). Fluconazole inhibits CYP3A4, which can increase plasma
methadone concentration and lead to opioid toxicity. Interestingly, not all P-450 3A4
inhibitors prolong methadone effects; other medications known to cause similar interactions
with methadone include voriconazole, ketoconazole, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, cimetidine,

and fluvoxamine.

(Choices A and B) Atovaquone and dapsone are alternative agents used to prevent
pneumocystis pneumonia in patients with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole allergy. Common
side effects of dapsone include hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia, particularly in
patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Neither medication has
