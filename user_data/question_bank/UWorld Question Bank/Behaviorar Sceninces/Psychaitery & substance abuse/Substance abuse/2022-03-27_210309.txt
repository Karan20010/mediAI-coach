cocaine).
(Choices D and G) Delusional disorder is characterized by 21 delusions lasting for 21 month
that are not accompanied by other psychotic symptoms. Schizophreniform disorder may be
diagnosed in patients who meet symptomatic criteria for schizophrenia for >1 month and <6

months. Neither diagnosis explains this patient's physical findings.

(Choice E) Opioid withdrawal presents with gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, diarrhea,
abdominal cramping), myalgias, mydriasis, piloerection, and lacrimation. Psychotic features
are not seen.

(Choice F) Phencyclidine (ie, PCP) intoxication may cause psychotic symptoms and violent
behavior. It typically presents with prominent nystagmus, a finding notably absent in this
patient.

Educational objective:

Cocaine intoxication can produce psychotic symptoms (eg, paranoid delusions), euphoria, and
agitation. Physical signs indicating sympathetic stimulation (eg, tachycardia, diaphoresis,
mydriasis) can assist in differentiating cocaine intoxication from primary psychiatric disorders.
