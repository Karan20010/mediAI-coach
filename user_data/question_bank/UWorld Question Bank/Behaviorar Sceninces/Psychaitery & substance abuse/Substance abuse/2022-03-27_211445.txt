Harm from opioid use (eg, overdose, addiction) represents a major patient safety concern and

is the leading cause of injury-related death in young adults. Physicians should prescribe
opioids only when indicated and minimize dose and duration of therapy. This patient's
acute, post-traumatic pain, which is uncontrolled with NSAIDS alone (eg, she experiences
breakthrough pain), is an appropriate indication for opioid therapy. Most patients with
traumatic or postoperative pain have significant improvement within the first 3-5 days and
may be prescribed a limited quantity of opioid medication with low risk of addiction.

When prescribing opioids, physicians should apply the following strategies to promote safety

and minimize potential harms:

¢ Prescribe a brief course of therapy (eg, 3-5 days), as risk of long-term opioid use in
opioid-naive patients increases after 5 days

e Prescribe short-acting opioids (eg, hydrocodone, oxycodone) only for breakthrough pain
(ie, instead of around-the-clock dosing)

e Maximize concurrent non-opioid therapies (eg, NSAIDs, heat, stretching), which increase
complementary analgesic effects and reduce opioid requirements

In addition, patients should receive close outpatient follow-up for pain reassessment, along
with proper counseling on safe opioid use and disposal of excess medications.
