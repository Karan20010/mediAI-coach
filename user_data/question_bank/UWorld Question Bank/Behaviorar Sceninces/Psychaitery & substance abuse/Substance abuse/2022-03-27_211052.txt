(Choice B) Prenatal exposure to cocaine can result in jitteriness, excessive sucking, and a
hyperactive Moro reflex (due to the toxic effects of cocaine); by contrast, withdrawal symptoms
from cocaine are usually not as severe as with opiates. Long-term effects on behavior,
attention level, and intelligence may be seen.

(Choice D) Prenatal exposure to phenytoin can result in fetal hydantoin syndrome, which is
characterized by nail and digit hypoplasia, dysmorphic facies, and intellectual disability.

Growth deficiency can also be seen.

(Choice E) Fetal exposure to valproic acid significantly increases the risk of neural tube
defects; may result in cardiac anomalies; and can produce dysmorphic facies, including a cleft
lip, narrow bifrontal diameter, midface hypoplasia, broad and depressed nasal bridge, and long

philtrum.

Educational objective:

Neonatal abstinence syndrome is caused by infant withdrawal to opiates (eg, heroin) and
usually presents in the first few days of life. It is characterized by irritability, a high-pitched cry,
poor sleeping, tremors, seizures, sweating, sneezing, tachypnea, poor feeding, vomiting, and

diarrhea.
