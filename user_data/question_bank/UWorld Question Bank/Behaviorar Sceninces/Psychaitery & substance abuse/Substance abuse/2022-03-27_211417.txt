dependent enzyme in the citric acid cycle is alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase.

Educational objective:

Several enzymes involved in glucose metabolism (eg, pyruvate dehydrogenase, alpha-
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase) require thiamine as a cofactor. The administration of glucose to
thiamine-deficient patients (eg, chronic alcohol use) can precipitate Wernicke encephalopathy
(eg, acute confusion, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia) due to rapid thiamine consumption.
