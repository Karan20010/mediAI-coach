Ethanol use leads to a number of biochemical changes in the CNS. It acutely potentiates the
effects of GABA (the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS) at GABA-A receptors,
leading to sedation. Chronic ethanol use causes downregulation of GABA receptors.
Alcohol also weakly inhibits excitatory NMDA receptors in the brain, and chronic exposure
leads to upregulation of these receptors. These adaptive changes result in tolerance (ie, the
need to increase the dose to achieve the desirable effect) and symptoms of withdrawal on
abrupt alcohol cessation, a common occurrence during hospital admission. Both tolerance
and withdrawal are signs of substance dependence.

Withdrawal symptoms can begin as early as 6 hours after the patient's last drink, typically
reach maximal intensity in 2-3 days, and subside in 4-5 days if the withdrawal is not severe.
Tremor, or "the shakes," is the most common initial finding. Patients also typically have
signs of mild autonomic dysfunction (eg, increased heart rate and respirations),
gastrointestinal distress (eg, nausea, vomiting), and anxiety.

(Choice A) Fluctuating arousal levels are characteristic of delirium tremens, a potentially fatal
manifestation of alcohol withdrawal that typically begins 48-96 hours after the last drink. Other
findings include sympathetic hyperactivity (eg, hyperthermia, hypertension), hallucinations (eg,
visual, auditory, and/or tactile), and confusion.
