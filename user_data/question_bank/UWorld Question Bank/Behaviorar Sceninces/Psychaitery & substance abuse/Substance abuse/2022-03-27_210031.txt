(Choices B and E) Delta and kappa are also opioid receptors that modulate pain. Although
naloxone does bind to these receptors, it binds to mu opioid receptors with greatest affinity.

(Choices C and D) GABAis the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain and is the
target of many drugs. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates work by binding to specific sites on
GABAA receptors to facilitate inhibitory effects of GABA. Flumazenil is a GABAA
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist used to reverse benzodiazepine intoxication. Baclofen is
an agonist at the GABA B receptor that acts as a skeletal muscle relaxant. This patient's
miosis and profound respiratory depression are more indicative of opioid overdose than
benzodiazepine or baclofen intoxication.

(Choice G) Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that binds to NMDA receptors.
Ketamine, a general anesthetic, is an example of an NMDA receptor antagonist. Naloxone
does not have effects on NMDA receptors.

Educational objective:

Naloxone is a pure opioid receptor antagonist used to treat opioid intoxication or overdose.
Although it binds to mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors, it has the greatest affinity for mu
receptors (which mediate opioid-induced bradycardia and respiratory depression), making it an
ideal agent for treating opioid intoxication.
