(Choice B) Opioid use disorder is characterized by uncontrolled use despite harmful
consequences (eg, social, professional). Although this patient exhibits withdrawal symptoms,
her opioid use remains controlled. Also, her primary focus is stopping opioid therapy rather
than securing the next dose, which is a feature common in patients with opioid use disorder.

(Choice D) Opioid tolerance refers to increasing dose requirements to achieve the same pain
control. Tolerance is commonly seen in patients with physical dependence, but would not
explain this patient's withdrawal symptoms upon attempted dose reduction.

Educational objective:

Chronic opioid therapy can lead to tolerance (ie, increased amount of opioids to achieve the
same pain relief), physical dependence (ie, development of withdrawal symptoms after abrupt
cessation), and opioid use disorder (ie, uncontrolled use despite harmful effects).
