quantity of alcohol consumption) are seen.

(Choices B and D) In the precontemplation stage, patients deny the problem or attribute it to

for change and is not yet considering specific strategies for change.

(Choices C and F) Intellectualization and rationalization are defense mechanisms rather than
stages of change. Intellectualization is the use of intellectual argument to avoid painful

Defense mechanisms are often used in the precontemplation or contemplation phases to avoid

acknowledging the problem or making behavioral changes.

which the individual has committed to behavioral change and is considering change strategies
