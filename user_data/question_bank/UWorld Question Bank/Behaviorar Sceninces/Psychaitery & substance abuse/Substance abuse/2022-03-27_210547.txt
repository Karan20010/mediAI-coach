patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. Neither medication has
significant interactions with methadone.
(Choice D) Rifampin is used (in combination with other antibiotics) in the treatment of multiple
mycobacterial infections (eg, tuberculosis, mycobacterium avium complex). It is a cytochrome
P-450 inducer and can result in lower plasma concentrations of methadone, thereby

decreasing its effects.

(Choice E) Valganciclovir is used for treatment and secondary prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus
retinitis. Side effects include bone marrow suppression and diarrhea. It does not interact with

methadone.

Educational objective:

Methadone is a mu-opioid receptor agonist used for maintenance treatment for opioid use
disorder; it is metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system, particularly by CYP3A4. Certain
inhibitors of CYP3A4 (eg, azoles, fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, cimetidine) can
increase plasma methadone concentration and lead to opioid toxicity (eg, sedation, respiratory

depression, miosis).
