Question Id: 20736
(Choice A) Transdermal opioids (eg, fentanyl) have similar pharmacodynamic properties as

oral opioids and carry a similar risk of misuse and addiction. In general, transdermal and other
long-acting opioid preparations are not recommended for acute pain in opioid-naive patients.

(Choice B) The patient is medically stable for discharge. Extending the hospitalization is
unlikely to provide additional benefit, may increase harms (eg, iatrogenic infections), and
represents inappropriate resource use.

(Choice C) Benzodiazepines have negligible analgesic benefits and also carry a risk of

addiction.

(Choice D) Because this patient's family history of opioid use disorder involved a cousin
rather than a first-degree relative, her personal risk of addiction is not significantly increased.
Moreover, using only NSAIDs is likely to undertreat her pain; limited use of short-acting opioids
for breakthrough pain is more appropriate.

Educational objective:

Most patients with acute pain (eg, trauma, post-operation) have significant improvement within
3-5 days and may be prescribed a brief course of opioid medication for breakthrough pain with
low risk of addiction. Physicians should minimize opioid duration and dose, counsel patients
on proper use, and maximize concurrent non-opioid therapies (eg, NSAIDs).
