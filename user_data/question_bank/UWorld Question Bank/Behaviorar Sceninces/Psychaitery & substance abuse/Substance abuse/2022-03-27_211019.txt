A 2-day-old infant is evaluated in the newborn nursery due to poor feeding. The infant is

irritable, is not sleeping well, and has had several episodes of vomiting and loose stools today.

A review of the maternal history reveals that the mother had poor prenatal care and that the

pregnancy was complicated by fetal growth restriction. On examination, the infant is

diaphoretic and has a high-pitched cry. The infant is also noted to have occasional sneezing

and is mildly tachypneic. No dysmorphic features are noted, and the remainder of the

examination is unremarkable. This infant's symptoms are most likely caused by prenatal

exposure to which of the following?

SY C. Heroin (55%)

A. Alcohol (11%)
B. Cocaine (27%)

E. Valproic acid (2%)
