This child's behavioral difficulties (distractibility, hyperactivity, hitting), growth retardation, poor
coordination, and facial anomalies are suggestive of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol
is a teratogen that affects multiple organ systems (eg, heart, joints, kidneys, visual systems,
auditory systems), most characteristically the CNS. Features of FAS include facial
dysmorphism (short palpebral fissures, thin upper lip, smooth philtrum), growth retardation,
and CNS involvement (structural and/or neurobehavioral).

Intrauterine alcohol exposure can cause reduction in the volume of the caudate, striatum,
thalamus, and cerebellum, resulting in abnormal reflexes, tone, and coordination. A decrease
in the volume of the frontal lobe and dysfunction of the amygdala contribute to deficits in
executive functioning, impulse control, and emotion regulation. Other neurobehavioral
manifestations include cognitive impairment, learning disabilities, and social skill deficits.

(Choice A) Fragile X syndrome is caused by unstable CGG (cytosine-guanine-guanine)
trinucleotide repeats on the X chromosome. Features include intellectual disability; a long,
narrow face; large, protruding ears; macrocephaly; and macroorchidism.

(Choice C) Cocaine exposure in utero is associated with hypertonia and tremors in neonates
and impairments in attention, language development, and behavioral regulation in school-aged

children. It would not cause the facial anomalies seen in this patient.
