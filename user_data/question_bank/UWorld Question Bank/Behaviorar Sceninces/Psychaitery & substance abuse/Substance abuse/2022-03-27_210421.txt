Back pain accompanied by a request for opioid medication is a relatively common occurrence
in the emergency department that requires differentiating inadequate pain management from
drug-seeking behavior. This patient exhibits many features concerning for drug-seeking
behavior, including requesting a specific medication by name, running out of medication,
and claiming pain out of proportion to the physical examination. Reporting lost or stolen
medication and obtaining multiple opioid prescriptions from different providers are other red
flags indicating misuse or diversion.

The best initial approach is to clarify the patient's medication history to determine which drugs
have been prescribed, by whom, and at what frequency. State-based, online, prescription
drug—monitoring programs are increasingly used in emergency departments to check for
undisclosed prescriptions, clarify prescription patterns, and identify patients who obtain
prescriptions from multiple providers. By identifying potential opioid misuse, physicians can
make more informed decisions regarding pain prescriptions.

(Choice A) It would be inappropriate to challenge the patient prior to clarifying her pattern of
medication use.

(Choice C) Repeating an MRI of the spine would not be the next step in a patient with a
normal physical examination and recent normal MRI.
