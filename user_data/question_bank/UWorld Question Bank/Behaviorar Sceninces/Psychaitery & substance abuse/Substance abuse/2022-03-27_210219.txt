Opioids work by selectively binding to G protein-coupled opioid receptors, mimicking the
actions of endogenous opioid peptides. However, long-term activation of mu-opioid receptors
on nociception-transmitting neurons is associated with increased pain sensitivity (central
sensitization) due to:

Â¢ Increased turnover of inhibitory opioid receptors (receptor downregulation) and decoupling
of receptors from their second messenger system (receptor decoupling)

e Upregulation of excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors

This manifests as an increasing dose requirement to provide the same level of pain relief
(tolerance) and pain sensations triggered by benign stimuli (opioid-induced hyperalgesia).
Opioid withdrawal can occur within 24-48 hours of acute cessation in opioid-tolerant patients
and is characterized by nausea/vomiting, myalgias, dilated pupils, diaphoresis, and
tachycardia.

Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that has low intrinsic activity (efficacy) for opioid mu-
receptors. However, it binds with high affinity (potency) and can prevent binding of other
opioid medications. Therefore, buprenorphine acts as an opioid receptor antagonist in the
presence of full opioid agonists and can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-tolerant patients with
