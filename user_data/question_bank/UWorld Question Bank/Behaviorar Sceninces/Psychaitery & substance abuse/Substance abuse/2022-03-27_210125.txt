withdrawal (eg, lacrimation) make opioid withdrawal more likely.

(Choice F) Nicotine withdrawal is commonly seen in the inpatient setting in chronic tobacco

irritability, anxiety, and increased appetite/weight gain.

(Choice H) Viral gastroenteritis is characterized by diarrhea, vomiting, and fever.
