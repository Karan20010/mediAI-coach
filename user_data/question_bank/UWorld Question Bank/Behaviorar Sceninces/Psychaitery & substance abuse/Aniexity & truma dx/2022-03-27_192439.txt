Benzodiazepines are typically divided into categories based on their half-lives (eg, short,

intermediate, long).

In selecting a benzodiazepine for this patient, it is important to minimize undesirable side
effects (eg, sedation, fatigue, impaired judgment), especially given the nature of her work.
This is best achieved by prescribing a short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepine such as
lorazepam (average half-life of 12 hours) at bedtime, which will lower her anxiety, help her fall

longer elimination half-lives are associated with prolonged side effects and should be avoided
when trying to minimize side effects.
