This patient's preoccupation with unexplained medical symptoms and excessive health care
use are characteristic of somatic symptom disorder. The best approach is to schedule
regular visits with her primary care provider, who can monitor her condition and avoid
unnecessary diagnostic testing and specialist referrals (Choices B and C).

In contrast to symptom-driven visits, regular visits provide patients with an opportunity to
discuss their concerns without the need to have new or worsening symptoms. This may
decrease the use of emergency services and encourage formation of a therapeutic alliance.
Rather than focusing on symptom elimination, office visits should emphasize a return to
occupational and social activities (functional improvement) and promotion of stress reduction
and healthy behaviors (eg, diet, exercise).

(Choices A and F) This patient currently has no insight into the psychological nature of her
disorder and would likely feel invalidated and unreceptive to being told that her condition is
psychogenic and/or by getting referred to a psychiatrist for treatment. Once a physician-
patient relationship is established, she may be able to accept that psychological distress plays
a role in her condition and be more receptive to psychiatric referral.

(Choice D) Use of potentially addictive pain medication should be avoided.
