This patient developed anxiety symptoms in the setting of a recent stressor (eg, divorce and
relocation); the absence of previous anxiety and brief duration make adjustment disorder the
most appropriate diagnosis. Adjustment disorder involves emotional or behavioral symptoms
(eg, anxiety, depression, disturbance of conduct) developing within 3 months of an
identifiable stressor and lasting no longer than 6 months once the stressor or its
consequences ceases. Symptoms in an adjustment disorder must be distressing and
impairing (eg, this patient seeks medical attention for insomnia and is socially isolative) but
are insufficient to meet full criteria for another mental disorder.

(Choice A) In acute stress disorder, the symptoms of re-experiencing (ie, intrusive memories

and flashbacks), avoidance, negative mood, dissociation, and hyperarousal last from 3 days to
1 month following a life-threatening traumatic event. This patient's symptoms do not meet the

criteria for this disorder, and her stressor is not life-threatening.

(Choices C and E) Although untreated thyroid conditions and excessive doses of
levothyroxine may cause mood and sleep disturbance, this patient's hypothyroidism is
adequately controlled, as evidenced by her normal TSH level.

(Choice D) Although anxiety, tension, and poor sleep are symptoms of generalized anxiety
disorder, this diagnosis requires that symptoms last 26 months.
