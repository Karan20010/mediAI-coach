A 21-year-old woman comes to the office at her mother's urging due to irritability and low
mood. Two months ago, the patient was sexually assaulted in the parking lot of her
workplace. Since then, she has felt that "the world is not a safe place" and is reluctant to go
back to work, preferring to stay home. In the middle of the day she will "space out" and hear
the voice of her assailant, "as if | am right there in the parking lot." At other times, she feels a
sense of unreality as if she is outside her body and cannot recall the exact details about what
happened, and says that, "I feel like | am going crazy." The patient has become withdrawn
and either avoids her friends or becomes "snappy" when they visit her. She has lost interest in
her hobbies of writing poetry and exercising. There is a family history of major depression in
the patient's mother and schizoaffective disorder in her maternal grandmother. Which of the
following is the most likely diagnosis?

©) A. Acute stress disorder
(©) B. Agoraphobia
©) C. Brief psychotic disorder

©) D. Depersonalization/derealization disorder
