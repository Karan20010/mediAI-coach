hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The patient has a long-standing relationship with her
primary care physician, who has treated her children as well. During the examination, she

patient is worried about her daughter being away from home for the first time and whether she
will be successful at school. At work, the patient occasionally has lapses of concentration
when worrying about whether her daughter is okay, but it has not affected her productivity.

patient has occasional insomnia and tension headaches but notes that these are nothing new.

patient's condition?
