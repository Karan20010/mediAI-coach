A 24-year-old woman comes to the office due to recurrent episodes of chest pain, palpitations,
and shortness of breath over the past few months. During some episodes, she experiences
dizziness, diaphoresis, and paresthesias of the hands. The episodes last 5-10 minutes, and
the patient constantly worries about when and where she will have another one. She says,
"This keeps happening and no one has been able to tell me why. I'm scared something might
be seriously wrong with me." The patient has been to the emergency department twice in the
past month for similar episodes; prior evaluation, including complete metabolic profile, thyroid
function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, ECG, cardiac enzymes, and chest x-ray, showed no
abnormalities. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination is unremarkable.
