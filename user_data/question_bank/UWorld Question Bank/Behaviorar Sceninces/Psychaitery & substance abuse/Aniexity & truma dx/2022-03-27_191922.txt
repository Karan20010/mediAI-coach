A 22-year-old college student comes to the office due to tension headaches and neck pain.

He has had these symptoms for many years, but they have increased in frequency over the
past 7 months since he started working at a coffee shop. The patient attends college and says
that although his grades are passing, he feels overwhelmed and fatigued: "I can't concentrate
on my schoolwork and worry that | will flunk out of school and never get a good job." He
sleeps very fitfully and frequently worries about his grades, health, and social life. He
obsesses about minor comments his friends have made about how "serious" he is, and gets
depressed thinking that he is not attractive enough to get a girlfriend. Which of the following is

the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

(©) A. Adjustment disorder

©) B. Generalized anxiety disorder

() C. Major depressive disorder

() D. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
©) E. Social anxiety disorder
