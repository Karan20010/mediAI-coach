A 54-year-old man comes to the office due to concerns about having pancreatic cancer after a
coworker died of the disease 6 months ago. The patient has no epigastric pain, jaundice, or
weight loss. However, he worries constantly because in researching the illness he read that it
may not have obvious symptoms in early stages and can be rapidly fatal. The patient saw
another physician 2 months ago, who performed a physical examination, laboratory evaluation,
and abdominal CT scan. The results were normal and the physician reassured the patient that
he did not have cancer. However, the patient reports that he has noticed occasional stomach
noises after eating and would like to have additional testing done. Which of the following is the
most likely diagnosis?

©) A. Adjustment disorder with anxiety

©) B. Conversion disorder

©) C. Delusional disorder (somatic subtype)
©) D. Factitious disorder
