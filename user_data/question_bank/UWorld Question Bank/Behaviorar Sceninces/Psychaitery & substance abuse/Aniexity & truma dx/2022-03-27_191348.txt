This patient's 2-month history of intrusive flashbacks, avoidance, dissociative symptoms
(amnesia, depersonalization), and emotional detachment following a traumatic incident are
suggestive of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Patients suffering from PTSD
repeatedly relive a traumatic, life-threatening event in the form of nightmares and/or
flashbacks (in which the patient feels as if the traumatic event is actually recurring).
Individuals will often avoid people, places, and activities that remind them of the traumatic
event and experience sleep disturbance, hypervigilance, low mood, and irritability. PTSD
requires persistent symptoms for 21 month.
