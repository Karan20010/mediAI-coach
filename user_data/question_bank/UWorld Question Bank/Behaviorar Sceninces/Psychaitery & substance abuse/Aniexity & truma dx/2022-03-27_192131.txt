A 28-year-old man comes to the office due to occasional anxiety attacks over the past 6
months. The patient describes episodes that "come out of nowhere" in which he feels light-
headed, sweaty, shaky, and nauseated. He says, "At first | didn't really care because the
attacks don't last long, but now I'm worried I'll have one while I'm at work or when I'm driving."
The patient has no history of cardiac disease and takes no medications. He has 4 or 5
alcoholic drinks 3 times a week and adds, "Having some beers and watching football really

help take my mind off of things." The patient appears calm, and vital signs are within normal

limits. Physical examination, ECG, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid function tests
show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for
this patient?

©) A. Benzodiazepine

©) B. Beta blocker

(©) C. Monoamine oxidase inhibitor
