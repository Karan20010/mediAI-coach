A 32-year-old man comes to the office due to anxiety that has intensified since he was
promoted to a managerial position. Whereas he previously worked alone, his new position
requires him to interact with a team of five employees and handle customer service
complaints. The patient says he is anxious throughout the day and fears that he will say
something embarrassing or that his coworkers and customers will notice his anxiety and think
he is incompetent. He says he was very quiet and shy growing up and would always get
anxious when meeting new people. He has a few friends with whom he socializes, but he
typically has three or four alcoholic drinks before going out with them to feel more relaxed.

The patient does not feel depressed, and his sleep and appetite are normal. A medication with
which of the following mechanisms of action would be most appropriate for this patient?

(©) A. Beta adrenergic blockade

(©) B. Dopamine and serotonin receptor antagonism
©) C. GABAg receptor agonism

©) D. Histamine receptor antagonism

() E. Monoamine oxidase inhibition
