panic attack when exposed to the phobic stimulus. However, panic attacks in specific phobia
are always triggered by the phobic stimulus; diagnosis of panic disorder requires that patients
experience recurrent, unexpected panic attacks with no trigger.

(Choice D) Both specific phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may be associated
with anxiety and avoidance of situations related to a traumatic event. However, PTSD also
involves intrusive symptoms of reexperiencing (eg, flashbacks, nightmares) that are not
present in this patient.

Educational objective:

Specific phobia is a common anxiety disorder characterized by high levels of anxiety and panic
attacks triggered by exposure, or anticipation of exposure, to a feared stimulus. As a result,
these patients try to avoid the phobic stimulus whenever possible.
