(Choice B) In body dysmorphic disorder, individuals have a preoccupation with perceived
defects in physical appearance. In contrast, this patient's eating and grooming rituals are
driven by a symmetry obsession and the need to prevent a feared event.

(Choice C) Generalized anxiety disorder involves excessive worry about multiple issues and
is not associated with intrusive thoughts and compulsive behaviors.

(Choice E) Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder involves a lifelong pattern of insistence
on control, orderliness, and perfection and does not include frank obsessions and compulsions
that are present in OCD. Personality disorders are generally not diagnosed before age 18 (or
in young adolescents) and would not explain this patient's recurrent compulsions performed in

response to anxiety-inducing obsessions.

(Choice F) Trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) involves recurrent pulling of hair and
repeated attempts to decrease or stop the behavior. It would not be diagnosed in this patient
who pulls out her hair as part of a symmetry obsession and compulsions.

Educational objective:
Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by persistent, unwanted thoughts
(obsessions) and repetitive, time-consuming rituals (compulsions) that the individual feels

driven to perform to alleviate anxiety.
