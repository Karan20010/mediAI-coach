This patient's intrusive flashbacks, arousal (ie, panic-like symptoms, sleep disturbance,
irritability), avoidance of returning to his volunteer work, and derealization (feeling detached
from his surroundings) lasting for 3 weeks after experiencing a life-threatening event are
suggestive of acute stress disorder (ASD). Nightmares of the event, depressed mood,
difficulty concentrating, decreased interest in activities, and hypervigilance are also common.
Reminders of the event, such as being in an enclosed or crowded space, can result in anxiety
or panic and lead to avoidance. This often results in significant functional impairment.

In ASD, symptoms usually develop directly following the trauma and last from 3 days to 1
month, after which they can resolve or develop into more chronic symptoms. When
symptoms persist for more than 1 month, the diagnosis is changed to post-traumatic stress
disorder (Choice F).

(Choice B) The precipitating incidents in adjustment disorders are typically common stressors
rather than life-threatening traumas. Adjustment disorders are also not diagnosed when
symptoms meet the criteria for another, more specific disorder, such as ASD.

(Choice C) In agoraphobia, patients avoid situations where escape may not be possible or
help may not be available if panic or other embarrassing symptoms occur. This patient's
avoidance is secondary to a traumatic event, and his symptoms better meet criteria for ASD.
