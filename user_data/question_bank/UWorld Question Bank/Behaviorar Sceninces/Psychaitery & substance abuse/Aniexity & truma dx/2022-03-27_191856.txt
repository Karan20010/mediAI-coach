This patient's sleep disturbance, tense moods, feelings of detachment, intrusive images,
hypervigilance, and flashbacks are characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
First-line treatment consists of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy and
antidepressant medication. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have the best
evidence for efficacy, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are also
commonly used. Although patients with PTSD commonly experience anxiety, hyperarousal,
and insomnia, there is little evidence to support the use of benzodiazepines and non-
benzodiazepine hypnotics (Choices B and E).

(Choice A) Antipsychotics are not a first-line treatment for PTSD. They may have a limited
role as augmentation in patients who have inadequate response to an SSRI/SNRI.

(Choices C and G) The older antidepressants (monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic
antidepressants) are used as second-line treatments for depression, but they have not been
shown to be effective in PTSD.

(Choice D) Mood stabilizers (eg, lithium, anticonvulsants with mood-stabilizing properties)
have a major role in treating bipolar disorders, but they have not proven effective in treating
PTSD.
