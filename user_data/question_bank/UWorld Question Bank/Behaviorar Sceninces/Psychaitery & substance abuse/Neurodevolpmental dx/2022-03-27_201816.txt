This child who was previously meeting developmental milestones now has dramatic regression
of speech and motor milestones accompanied by repetitive hand movements, which is
concerning for Rett syndrome (RS). RS is a sporadic, X-linked genetic disorder characterized
by normal development until age 6-18 months, when regression of speech, loss of
purposeful hand movements, development of stereotypical movements (eg, clapping), and
gait abnormalities occur.

MECP2 is a gene encoded on the X chromosome that has abundant expression in the brain.
It is thought to impact synaptic maturation and cortical maintenance. Neuropathology is
consistent with arrested brain development (eg, impaired dendritic maturation, reduced
neuromelanin in substantia nigra) rather than death of neurons (ie, neurodegeneration). Brain
growth decelerates after birth, with no further growth after age 4.

(Choice A) The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, seen in Alzheimer disease,
is neurotoxic and can lead to neuronal cell death. However, neuropathology in RS is
characterized by arrested development rather than neuronal degeneration.

(Choice C) Copper deposition in the lenticular nucleus is characteristic of Wilson disease.
Although Wilson disease can present with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including dysarthria

and ataxia, it typically presents in adolescence with liver disease; Kayser-Fleischer rings are
