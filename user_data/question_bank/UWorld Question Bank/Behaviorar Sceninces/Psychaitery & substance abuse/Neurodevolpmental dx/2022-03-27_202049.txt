Question Id: 11592

(Choice C) ODD should be differentiated from conduct disorder, in which the problematic
behaviors are more severe and aggressive. This patient does not exhibit destruction of
property, physical aggression or cruelty toward people or animals, or the typical pattern of

stealing or deceit seen in conduct disorder.

(Choice D) In disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, patients also present with irritable
mood. However, this is accompanied by repetitive temper outbursts (verbal or physical) that
are out of proportion to the stimulus and inconsistent with developmental level. Symptoms
should manifest prior to age 10.

Educational objective:

Oppositional defiant disorder is a behavioral disorder of childhood characterized by
argumentative and defiant behavior toward authority figures. It does not involve the more
severe violations of the basic rights of others seen in conduct disorder.
