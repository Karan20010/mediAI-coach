Question Id: 11809

This patient's hyperactivity, impulsivity, and disorganization that are resulting in behavioral
problems both at school and at home are characteristic of attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD). Psychostimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are first-line
treatment for ADHD in school-age children and are generally safe and well tolerated. They
have a rapid onset of action, resulting in improvement in core ADHD symptoms for the
expected duration of action (Choices C and F).

The most common adverse effects include decreased appetite, weight loss, and
insomnia. Most affected children will experience a mild decrease in appetite that can typically
be managed by administering the medication after meals and encouraging the child to eat
nutrient-dense foods. Other psychostimulant adverse effects that are less common include
tics and increases in heart rate and blood pressure. During treatment, patients are typically
seen monthly to monitor weight, height, heart rate, and blood pressure.

(Choices A, E, and H) Increased appetite, weight gain, and sedation are adverse effects
commonly associated with second-generation antipsychotics; acute dystonia is an
extrapyramidal side effect most commonly seen with high-potency first-generation
antipsychotics. These drugs do not have a role in the treatment of ADHD.
