An 8-year-old boy is brought to the pediatrician for school refusal. He has not gone to school
for a few days, saying that he has a stomachache. However, when it comes time for soccer
practice, he has no physical symptoms. When the pediatrician asks how things are going at
school, the patient says, "kids laughed at me when the teacher said she couldn't read my
homework." His mother brings a recent report from the boy's teacher, which says that he is
able to read and do math, but that when writing he fidgets a lot and stares out the window. His
writing is unclear, disorganized, and below the level of his peers. His mother received a call
from his teacher last week after the boy threw his writing book on the floor and began to cry.
Vital signs and physical examination, including abdominal examination, are normal. At this
time, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

©) A. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
() B. Language disorder

©) C. Mild intellectual disability

©) D. Oppositional defiant disorder

©) E. Social anxiety disorder
