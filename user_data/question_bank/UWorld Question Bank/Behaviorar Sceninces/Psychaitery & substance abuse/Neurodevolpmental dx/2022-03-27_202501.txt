This patient's normal development through age 10 months followed by regression (eg, loss of
babbling and motor control) and development of hand wringing is characteristic of Rett
syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in girls. Most cases are due to
de novo mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene. Rett syndrome is characterized by normal
development until age 6-18 months, followed by a loss of motor and language skills and
the development of stereotypic hand movements. Deceleration of head growth is a
classic feature of Rett syndrome and can be an early sign. Other features include seizures,
intellectual disability, autistic features, and breathing abnormalities.

There is no specific therapy for Rett syndrome; many patients survive well into adulthood with

severe, permanent neurologic deficits.

(Choice A) Features of Angelman syndrome include a happy disposition, jerky gait, and hand
flapping. Development is commonly delayed rather than initially normal.

(Choice B) Although this patient has deficits in verbal communication and stereotypical hand
movements, she does not display other features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) such as
deficits in social reciprocity, emotional restriction, or repetitive interests. She plays and
snuggles with family and appears to be trying to interact with the doctor.
