(Choice B) Antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors is the mechanism of action of antipsychotic
medications. These drugs do not specifically treat ADHD.

(Choices D and E) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants increase availability
of serotonin by blocking serotonin reuptake from the synapse. Serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors block the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine. These agents are
commonly used to treat depressive and anxiety disorders, not ADHD.

(Choice F) Benzodiazepines work as positive allosteric modulators of GABA, facilitating the
increased frequency of chloride-channel opening in the GABA receptor. Benzodiazepines
have sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and muscle-relaxant properties.

Educational objective:
Stimulant medications are a first-line treatment for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. They
work by increasing the availability of norepinephrine and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex.
