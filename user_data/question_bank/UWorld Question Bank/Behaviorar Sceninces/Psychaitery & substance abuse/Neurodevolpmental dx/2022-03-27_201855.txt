This patient's inattention, inability to sit still, and impulsivity are concerning for possible
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The diagnosis of ADHD is made clinically and
requires evidence of symptoms in 22 settings (eg, home, school, after-school program).
Demonstration of functional impairment due to symptoms (eg, academic difficulties, impaired
social relationships, peer rejection) is also required.

Obtaining teacher evaluations to determine if the symptoms extend beyond the home
environment would be the most helpful step in establishing the diagnosis. Teachers can
provide observations of classroom behavior over an extended period (eg, 6 months) and assist
in determining if the symptoms are excessive compared to same-age peers (eg, comparative
degree of inattentiveness, difficulty staying seated and/or following directions, talkativeness,
disruptive classroom behavior). Teacher evaluations may also incorporate validated ADHD-
specific rating scales, which can help assess core symptom severity and monitor response to
treatment.

(Choices A and C) Brain imaging and EEG are not performed routinely in the work-up of
ADHD in the absence of other neurological symptoms. They would not be indicated in this

patient with no other medical history and a normal physical examination.
