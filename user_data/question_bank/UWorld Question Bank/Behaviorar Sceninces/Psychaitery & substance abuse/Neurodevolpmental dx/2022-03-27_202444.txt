(Choice C) Sydenham chorea is a manifestation of rheumatic fever (related to group A
streptococcal infection) characterized by choreiform movements (brief, random, irregular
contractions of the limbs and face), emotional lability, and hypotonia. Tics can be differentiated
from chorea by their patterned, repetitive appearance; ability to be temporarily suppressed;

and association with premonitory urges.

(Choice E) Wilson disease is caused by copper accumulation and can present in children and
adolescents. It is characterized by liver dysfunction, neurological signs (eg, dysarthria,
dystonia, ataxia) rather than tics, and psychiatric abnormalities (eg, depression, psychosis).

Educational objective:

Tourette syndrome is a common childhood neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by both
vocal and multiple motor tics. These tics characteristically wax and wane, can be suppressed
temporarily, and are preceded by a premonitory urge.
