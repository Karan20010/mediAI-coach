Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common behavioral disorder
characterized by a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity that
interferes with functioning in 22 settings (eg, school, home). Diagnosis requires the presence
of symptoms before age 12 with 26 inattentive and/or hyperactive/impulsive symptoms for 26
months. This patient's combination of inattentive symptoms (ie, forgetful, disorganized, loses
things) and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms (ie, difficulty staying seated, interrupts others) is
characteristic of the combined subtype. ADHD is more common in boys; girls are more likely

to have the inattentive subtype.

(Choice A) Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when symptoms develop within 3 months of
an identifiable stressor. This child's symptoms predated the family move.

(Choice C) Although this child occasionally tries to hit his sibling when frustrated, he does not
exhibit behavior that consistently violates major societal norms or the basic rights of others
(eg, repeated aggression, property destruction, theft, deceitfulness, rule violations), which
would characterize conduct disorder.

(Choice D) Children with ADHD often experience difficulty with peer relationships due to their
impulsive and disruptive behaviors. However, this child does not exhibit the excessive social
anxiety and fear of negative peer evaluation that is characteristic of social anxiety disorder.
