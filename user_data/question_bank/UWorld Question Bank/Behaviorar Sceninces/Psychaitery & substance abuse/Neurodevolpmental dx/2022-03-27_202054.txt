A 2-year-old boy is brought to the clinic by his mother, who is concerned about his language
development. She says, "I know that children speak at different ages and he is still young, but
lam concerned that his speech isn't progressing and that he needs to interact with other
children more. His day care teacher says that he is shy and sits in a corner playing with his
favorite truck. We have also been busy with a recent move and have not given him as much
attention, which doesn't help." The patient's birth history, medical history, and audiology
screening are unremarkable. His mother is 6 months pregnant with her second child, and the
family moved to a new home 3 months ago. In the examination room, the patient sits ina
corner, avoiding eye contact with the doctor and repeatedly spinning the wheels of a toy truck.

formed words. When his mother tries to take his truck away, he begins screaming and pulls it
back. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?

©) A. Adjustment disorder
©) B. Autism spectrum disorder
