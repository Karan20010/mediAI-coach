(Choice B) A hearing test is not routinely performed in the initial evaluation of ADHD, and
hearing impairment would have likely been identified by this age. However, a hearing test
should be performed if coexisting hearing impairment is suspected.

(Choice D) Aspeech and language evaluation would be warranted if the patient had problems
with speech articulation/production or his language development was delayed.

(Choice F) Toxicology screening is not routinely performed in the assessment of ADHD. It is
less likely to be helpful in the assessment of this patient who lacks any history pointing to
medical illness or substance use.

Educational objective:

Diagnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder requires evidence of inattentive and/or
hyperactive/impulsive symptoms for 26 months in 22 settings (eg, home, school, after-school
program). Teacher evaluations can assist in diagnosis.
