This patient's disorganization, forgetfulness, excessive procrastination, difficulty completing
tasks, irritability, restlessness, and distractibility are suggestive of adult attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidence of behavioral problems since childhood (some
symptoms prior to age 12 are required) and the chronic nature of his difficulties further support
this diagnosis. ADHD frequently persists into adulthood and may go unrecognized or

misdiagnosed as an anxiety, mood, or personality disorder.

Although the same diagnostic criteria are used, adults with ADHD are less overtly
hyperactive compared to children. They typically experience a sense of inner restlessness,
irritability, impulsive speech, and decision making and executive skills dysfunction (eg,
difficulties in organizing/prioritizing tasks, lack of follow-through, forgetfulness, poor time
management) that can result in significant social and occupational impairment (eg,
unemployment, reduced productivity, relationship difficulties). Stimulant medication is the first-
line treatment for adult ADHD.

(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is diagnosed when symptoms occur in response to a stressor
and do not meet the criteria for another mental disorder. This patient's symptoms and
impairment are long-standing and are likely the cause of his employment and relationship

difficulties.
