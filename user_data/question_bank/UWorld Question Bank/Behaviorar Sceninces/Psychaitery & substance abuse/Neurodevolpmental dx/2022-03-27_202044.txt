Question Id: 11592
This patient's pattern of deliberately annoying behavior and defiance of rules and authority
figures that causes problems at home and at school suggests a diagnosis of oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD). Blaming failures on others and being angry, argumentative or
resentful are also characteristic of the disorder. Although the behavior often manifests with
family members, it must also be observed during interactions with other individuals.

For diagnosis, the oppositional behaviors must be excessive in frequency and duration when
compared to normative age-appropriate behaviors. Although adolescents may test boundaries
and assert their independence, this patient's 1-year history of persistent defiance, skipping
classes, repeated refusal to follow rules, and irritable mood are beyond what would be
expected for a 12-year-old girl (Choice E).

(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for and
violation of the rights of others and is not diagnosed in individuals age <18.

(Choice B) Although attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is commonly comorbid
with ODD, this patient does not exhibit characteristic inattentive and hyperactive symptoms.
Children with ODD should be assessed and treated for comorbid ADHD and learning
disorders.
