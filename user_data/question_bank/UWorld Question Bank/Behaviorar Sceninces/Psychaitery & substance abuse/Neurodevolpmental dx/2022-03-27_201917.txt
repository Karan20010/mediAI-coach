At age 2, a child should have a vocabulary of 50-200 words and be able to use 2-word
phrases. This patient has an isolated language disorder; her motor and social skills are
normal. Language is the most commonly delayed milestone, with an estimated prevalence
of 10%-15% at age 2. Many children with isolated language delay will catch up in preschool
(prevalence falls to 5% after age 3). However, children with persistent language deficits are at
increased risk for writing and/or reading learning disorders in their school years. This child
should have a hearing examination as well as a speech and language evaluation, which can
help to assess and monitor her language development.

(Choice A) Although it is appropriate to reassure the mother that development varies among
children, it is incorrect to imply that no further action is required at this time. Children are
adaptable; their brains are constantly developing, and they can make great gains with early
intervention and close monitoring.

(Choice B) Autism spectrum disorder is characterized by impaired social
communication/interactions and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior or interests typically
presenting by age 2. This child interacts well with her peers and family, and her mother has
described no repetitive behaviors or fixed interests.
