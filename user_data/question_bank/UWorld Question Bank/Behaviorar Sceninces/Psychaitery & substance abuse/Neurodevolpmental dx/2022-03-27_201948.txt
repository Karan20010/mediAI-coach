(Choice C) Global developmental delay is characterized by a failure to meet age-related
expectations in multiple areas, including intellectual, communicative, social, and motor
functions. This child is functioning below her age in the area of language only.

(Choice D) This child's speech development is not within the normal range and requires
further assessment.

(Choice E) Selective mutism is a failure to speak in a specific social situation (eg, school) but
not in other situations (eg, home). It is often associated with anxiety, especially social phobia.
This child's language impairment is not specific to a certain situation.

Educational objective:

At age 2, children should have a vocabulary of 50-200 words and be using 2-word phrases.
Parents’ concerns about delayed milestones should be validated; they should be reassured
that children often catch up but may need help. Further evaluation and regular monitoring are
required.
