Delirium is an acute-onset "confusional state" characterized primarily by waxing and waning
mental status changes and impaired attention. Disorientation, agitation, psychosis, and sleep
disturbances may also occur. Delirium occurs secondary to an underlying medical condition,
such as a urinary tract infection, and therefore the primary management is treating the
underlying cause. The elderly and those with preexisting cognitive disorders are at a higher
risk for delirium and may present with varying degrees of agitation.

High-potency, first-generation antipsychotics (eg, haloperidol) and some second-generation
antipsychotics (eg, quetiapine) can be used for the acute treatment of agitation and
psychosis associated with delirium. Antipsychotic use is appropriate in the treatment of
delirium in the elderly if the patient is at risk of acute harm to self or others and behavioral
interventions have failed. Under these conditions, the benefits of antipsychotics (ie, the
provision of safety) outweigh the potential risks when used at low doses and short durations.

(Choice A) Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic that is reserved for patients with
treatment-refractory schizophrenia. It is not used for the short-term treatment of agitation in
delirium due to the risk of agranulocytosis.

(Choice B) Doxepin is a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic effects that can worsen

delirium. It may be used for the treatment of insomnia in other settings.
