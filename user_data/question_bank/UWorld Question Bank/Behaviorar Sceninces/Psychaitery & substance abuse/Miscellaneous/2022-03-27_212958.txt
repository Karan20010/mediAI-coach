(Choices A and E) 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is
the mechanism of action of many antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, antidepressants are not used in the
treatment of acute mania. Serotonergic drugs can cause serotonin syndrome (SS), but not
NMS. SS has overlapping features with NMS (eg, autonomic dysregulation, mental status
changes) but is characterized by neuromuscular irritability and hyperreflexia (eg, clonus) rather
than generalized muscle rigidity.

(Choice C) Medications that enhance the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (eg,
benzodiazepines) are often used as adjunctive treatment in acute mania to target agitation and
insomnia. However, benzodiazepines do not cause NMS.

(Choice D) Glutamate (which is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain) may be
affected by some antipsychotic medications and mood stabilizers, but it is not known to have a
primary role in the development of NMS.

Educational objective:

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is characterized by severe muscular rigidity, mental
status changes, autonomic dysregulation, and hyperthermia. Dopamine antagonism, the
mechanism of action of most antipsychotics, has been implicated as a primary cause of NMS.
