This patient initially had multiple symptoms of an acute manic episode (increased activity,
decreased need for sleep, racing thoughts, pressured speech, grandiose and paranoid
delusions) and likely received antipsychotic medication to target his agitation and
psychosis. His subsequent development of fever, confusion, abnormal vital signs, and
difficulty moving 5 days later is consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), an
uncommon but life-threatening complication of dopamine antagonists.

NMS is characterized by hyperthermia, severe muscular rigidity, altered mental status,
and autonomic dysfunction (eg, labile blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis). It most
commonly occurs within the first 2 weeks of initiation of therapy but can occur anytime during
treatment. NMS is thought to be primarily due to dysregulation of dopamine. D2
antagonism is the mechanism of action of all first-generation and most second-generation
antipsychotics. Central dopamine receptor blockade in the hypothalamus is believed to be
responsible for autonomic dysregulation and hyperthermia. Dopamine antagonism in the
nigrostriatal pathway may lead to the diffuse "lead-pipe" rigidity.

(Choices A and E) 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is
the mechanism of action of many antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,
serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, antidepressants are not used in the
