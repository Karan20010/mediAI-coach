This patient's repeated nocturnal episodes of violent motor behaviors reflecting dream
enactment are consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD).

Normal REM sleep is characterized by vivid dreams, rapid eye movements, and voluntary
muscle atonia due to inhibition of motor neurons. In patients with RBD, degeneration of the
brainstem nuclei responsible for inhibiting spinal motor neurons during normal REM sleep
leads to incomplete or absent muscle atonia (ie, excessive, sustained muscle tone during
REM sleep), facilitating dream enactment behaviors. Episodes typically occur at least 90
minutes after sleep onset, coinciding with the onset of REM sleep, and are more frequent in
the second half of the night when the percentage of REM sleep increases. Patients can
usually be awakened fairly easily and are alert and oriented. They may not recall their
movements during sleep but can often recall their dreams.

RBD is more likely to occur in older adult men (average age 61 years). It can be caused by
medications (eg, antidepressants, narcolepsy medications). It may also be a prodromal sign of
neurodegeneration with risk of subsequent onset of Parkinson disease or dementia with Lewy

bodies.

Epileptiform discharges often start from a specific focus (eg, temporal or frontal lobe) and may
