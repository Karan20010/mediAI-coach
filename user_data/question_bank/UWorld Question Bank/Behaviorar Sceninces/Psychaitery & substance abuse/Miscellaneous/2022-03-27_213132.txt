sleep apnea), and adverse eifects of pharmacotherapy (eg, benzodiazepines).

(Choices A, C, and F) This patient does not meet criteria for dementia (ie, progressive
cognitive impairment that impairs ADLs). Alzheimer disease presents with early and prominent
memory impairment. Frontotemporal dementia presents with personality and behavioral
changes. Vascular dementia is characterized by focal neurological deficits and evidence of
cerebrovascular disease on imaging.

(Choice B) Although depression may be associated with reversible cognitive impairment, this
patient does not meet criteria for major depressive disorder.

(Choice E) Although mild memory issues may be a part of normal aging (eg, difficulty
remembering names, decreased processing speed), this patient's objective evidence of
cognitive impairment on formal cognitive testing is not normal and requires further evaluation.

Mild cognitive impairment is diagnosed when cognitive decline is present but activities of daily
living (eg, bathing, preparing meals, managing finances) are preserved. In contrast, dementia
