A 34-year-old man comes to the office for evaluation of opioid use disorder. He was

prescribed oxycodone for a sports-related injury in his mid-20s, developed dependency, and

began using intravenous heroin in its place. In the past few years, the patient has had multiple

overdoses requiring naloxone administration. He recently tried quitting heroin on his own but

experienced recurrent relapses. He has now been abstinent for 2 days but reports significant

cravings. After a discussion of various treatment options, the patient is prescribed

buprenorphine. The dose-response curve of this medication is shown in the image below:
