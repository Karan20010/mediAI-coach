Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, are occasionally used for insomnia

or adjunctive pain management when other medications are not effective. However, TCAs

have strong anticholinergic properties that can lead to significant adverse effects such as

confusion, constipation, and acute urinary retention. Elderly patients are at increased risk

for side effects due to comorbid conditions (eg, dementia, benign prostatic hyperplasia),

decreased hepatic and renal clearance of medications, and a higher burden of concurrent

medications that can interact with TCA's and contribute to adverse effects. As a result, TCAs

are relatively contraindicated in elderly patients.

(Choices B and F) Metformin can cause lactic acidosis, and atorvastatin can cause hepatitis
and myositis. These drugs do not have significant anticholinergic side effects.

(Choice C) Duloxetine is a dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor used for the
treatment of depression, anxiety, and a variety of chronic pain disorders. Duloxetine can
cause confusion, but only rarely causes obstructive voiding symptoms.

(Choices D and G) Finasteride and tamsulosin are used for treatment of benign prostatic
hyperplasia and should not cause urinary obstruction or retention.

(Choice E) Gabapentin is useful for painful diabetic neuropathy. It can cause sedation,

confusion. and incoordination, but it does not have significant anticholinergic side effects.
