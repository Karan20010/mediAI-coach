This patient's inability to recall an event that cannot be explained as ordinary forgetfulness is
consistent with dissociative amnesia. This disorder typically consists of localized or
selective amnesia for a particular event, as in this patient's inability to recall her sister's
drowning, but it can also involve more generalized amnesia for personal identity and
autobiographical history. Onset is typically sudden and preceded by overwhelming or
intolerable events.

Definitive diagnosis requires ruling out the effects of a substance (eg, alcohol-induced
blackouts, illicit substances, medications) or a neurologic condition (eg, brain trauma).
Amnesia involving traumatic events can also occur as a feature of acute or posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD).

(Choice A) Adjustment disorder is characterized by psychologic symptoms that occur in
response to an identifiable, non-life threatening psychosocial stressor (eg, relationship conflict,
job loss). Adjustment disorder would not explain this patient's sudden amnesia in response to
an overwhelming traumatic event.

(Choice B) Although complicated grief reaction may include a sense of disbelief, itis a
persistent disorder that lasts at least 6-12 months after the loss. It is characterized by intense
yearning for the deceased, ruminative thoughts, and dysfunctional behavior.
