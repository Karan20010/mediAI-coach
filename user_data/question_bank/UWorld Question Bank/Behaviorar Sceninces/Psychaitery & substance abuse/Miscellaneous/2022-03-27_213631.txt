drowning of her younger sister a week ago. The patient, her sister, and 2 friends had gone
swimming in the ocean. When the sister became submerged, the patient attempted to rescue
her but was overpowered by strong rip currents and was forced to return to shore. The mother
is concerned that her daughter seems to be unaware of her sister's death and believes she is
"in denial." The patient was unable to answer questions from the police about the drowning
and reports she cannot remember any details of what happened that day. Physical
examination is unremarkable. On mental status examination, the patient is alert and fully
oriented. She becomes upset and confused when the incident is discussed. Which of the
