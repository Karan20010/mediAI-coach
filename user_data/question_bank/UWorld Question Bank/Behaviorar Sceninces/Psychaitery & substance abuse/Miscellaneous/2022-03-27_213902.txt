This patient's repeated nocturnal episodes of complex motor behaviors that reflect dream
enactment are consistent with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). RBD is a parasomnia
characterized by dream enactment that occurs because the muscle atonia usually
accompanying REM sleep is absent or incomplete. When awakened, patients may be
transiently confused but very quickly become fully alert. They may not recall their movements
during sleep but can frequently remember their dreams.

RBD is more likely to occur in men age >50 and is strongly associated with alpha-synuclein
neurodegenerative disorders. Alpha-synuclein is a synaptic protein that accumulates in
neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and
multiple system atrophy. Spontaneous (ie, not associated with medications) RBD is
considered a prodromal syndrome of alpha-synuclein neurodegeneration because up to 90%
of patients with idiopathic RBD eventually develop one of these conditions.

(Choices B and D) Extracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid and/or tau proteins occurs in
Alzheimer dementia, which typically presents with early and prominent memory impairment
with language deficits and spatial disorientation. Although sleep disturbances commonly occur
in patients with Alzheimer dementia, they usually impact sleep initiation and continuity and

occur later in the disease process.
