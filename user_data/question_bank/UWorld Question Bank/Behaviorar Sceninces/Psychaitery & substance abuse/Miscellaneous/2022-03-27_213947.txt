(Choice B) Excessive anxiety related to unexplained physical symptoms is characteristic of
somatic symptom disorder. These patients do not intentionally falsify their symptoms; their
presentation is genuine. In contrast, this patient is not excessively anxious and appears to be
exaggerating his symptoms for an external gain.

(Choice C) Preoccupation with having a serious illness is a key feature of illness anxiety
disorder. These patients fear having a serious diagnosis despite few or no symptoms. This
patient has exaggerated symptoms and is focused on avoiding work responsibilities rather
than fear that a serious medical condition has been missed.

(Choice D) Although malingering can be associated with conditional threats of self-harm,
suicide, or violence (eg, a patient threatens to kill himself if demands are not met), recurrent
suicidal behaviors (eg, gestures and attempts) are associated with borderline personality
disorder and are often motivated by fears of abandonment.

Educational objective:

Malingering is a behavior characterized by intentional falsification or exaggeration of
symptoms to obtain an obvious external reward. The presentation is typically based on a
subjective report of symptoms, and these patients commonly refuse to undergo invasive
medical procedures.
