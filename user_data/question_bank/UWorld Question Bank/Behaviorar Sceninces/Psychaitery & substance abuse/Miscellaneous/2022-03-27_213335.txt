microtubules, and it normally takes part in microtubule stabilization. In patients with FTD,

tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disassociates from the microtubules, which may
lead to instability and disrupted axonal transport. Phosphorylated tau aggregates to form
inclusions that can appear as neurofibrillary tangles (similar to those seen in Alzheimer
disease) or round inclusions (ie, Pick bodies).

¢ Abnormal TDP-43 protein inclusions: TDP-43 is a protein involved in DNA repair and
transcription, and it becomes abnormally ubiquitinated in FTD. Pathologic TDP-43 is also
found in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

(Choice B) Cytoplasm inclusions with alpha synuclein are characteristic of dementia with

Lewy bodies, which is characterized by visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive

fluctuations, and REM sleep behavior disorder.

(Choice C) Cytosolic vacuolation of neurons and glia with prion inclusions are seen in

patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a prion disease. Although behavioral changes are

common, dementia is rapidly progressive and associated with myoclonus and/or seizures.

(Choices D and E) Presenilin is a component of the gamma-secretase complex, which is

involved in cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Abnormal cleavage of APP leads

to increased beta amyloid deposition that is commonly seen in patients with Alzheimer
