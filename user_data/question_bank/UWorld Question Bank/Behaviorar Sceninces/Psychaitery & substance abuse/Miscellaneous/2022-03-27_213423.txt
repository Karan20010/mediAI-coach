(Choice A) Baclofen, a selective agonist of the GABA B receptor, works as a skeletal muscle
relaxant by inhibiting reflexes at the spinal cord level. Its common adverse effects include
sedation and dizziness.
(Choices B and D) Celecoxib and naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

commonly used as initial therapy for acute low back pain. Celecoxib is a selective inhibitor of
cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), whereas naproxen is a nonselective inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-
2. Neither drug is associated with serotonin syndrome.

(Choice C) Diazepam is a benzodiazepine that works by binding to GABAA receptors.
Benzodiazepines have sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsive, and muscle-relaxing properties;
adverse effects include impairment of psychomotor performance, amnesia, and dependence.

Educational objective:

Coadministration of tramadol with serotonergic medications such as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors increases the risk of serotonin syndrome, which presents with the
characteristic triad of mental status changes (agitation, confusion), autonomic instability
(hyperthermia, diaphoresis), and neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremor, myoclonus).
