resides for evaluation of mental status changes. At baseline, she has mild memory impairment
but is otherwise cognitively intact, calm, and cooperative with the nursing home staff. Over the
past 24 hours, she has become increasingly combative and agitated and stayed up all night.
Behavioral interventions and environmental modifications have not been helpful. The patient's
medical conditions include hypertension and a history of anxiety and depression. Temperature
is 37.2 C (99 F), blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg, pulse is 84/min, and respirations are
18/min. Neurological examination is normal, but the patient is unable to attend to the
conversation, is mildly disoriented, and cannot state the days of the week backwards. Without
provocation, she strikes out at a nurse's aide standing next to her. Laboratory results are
normal except for urinalysis, which shows an increased presence of white blood cells and is:
positive for nitrites. Head CT scan is negative. In addition to starting antibiotic therapy, which
of the following medications is most appropriate to treat this patient's behavioral symptoms?
