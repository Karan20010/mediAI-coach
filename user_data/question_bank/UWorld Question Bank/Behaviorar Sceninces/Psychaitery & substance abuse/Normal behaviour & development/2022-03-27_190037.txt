This patient's distress at interacting with unfamiliar people is typical of stranger anxiety, a
normal part of development that begins around age 6 months. It is characterized by distress
(expressed by crying, screaming, clinging) when unfamiliar people approach and occurs
even in the presence of the caregiver. The development of stranger anxiety at this age
indicates that the infant has made a specific attachment to the primary caregiver (mother) and

is able to distinguish her from a strange or less familiar individual.

Stranger anxiety typically peaks around age 9 months and resolves on its own by 2 years of
age. Adjustment disorders are diagnosed when the response to a stressor is greater than
would be expected and associated with impairment (Choice A). Stranger anxiety is a normal
and expected developmental milestone.

(Choice B) It is normal for an 11-month-old infant to avoid contact with a stranger if
distressed. If an infant persistently shows poor eye contact, lacks joint attention, and has no
response to being called by name at age 12-15 months, these may represent early signs of an
autism spectrum disorder and should be evaluated further.

(Choice D) Reactive attachment disorder occurs in children exposed to neglect and abuse
and is characterized by decreased emotional responsiveness and lack of response to adult

comfort. This infant appears to be appropriately attached to his mother.
