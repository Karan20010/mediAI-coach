disorder, she lacks the pervasive pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships and self-
image, marked impulsivity, and self-injury that characterize the disorder. Personality disorders
are not diagnosed in adolescence, as the personality is still forming.

(Choice C) Cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving
numerous periods of hypomanic and depressive symptoms that are insufficient to meet the
criteria for hypomanic or major depressive episodes. Symptoms must be present for at least a
year in children and adolescents and cause significant distress and impairment; this is not the
case in this patient.

(Choice D) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a new diagnosis in DSM-5, is
characterized by persistent irritability and frequent, developmentally inappropriate temper
outbursts. This patient's transient emotional outburst related to insecurity about social
acceptance is consistent with normal adolescent development.

(Choice F) This patient does not exhibit the argumentative, defiant, and vindictive behavior
required for the diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder.
