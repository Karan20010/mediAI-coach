This patient's sadness, insomnia, and decreased appetite are consistent with a normal grief
reaction precipitated by the loss of a loved one (bereavement). In a normal grief reaction, the
sadness revolves around feelings of loss and typically occurs in "waves" intermixed with
positive memories of the deceased. For most, the natural mourning process lasts 6-12
months and is followed by the integration of grief, in which the individual continues to feel
transient but less pronounced sadness, and life plans/routines have adapted to living without
the deceased.

Normal grief can resemble a major depressive episode as both may include intense
sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss. However, this
woman's positive memories about her husband, ability to continue volunteering, and lack of
other depressive symptoms (eg, hopelessness, feelings of low self-worth, guilt, suicidal
ideation) make major depression less likely (Choice B). A major depressive disorder can be
diagnosed during a grief reaction if a sufficient number and severity of depressive symptoms
are present.

(Choice A) Dependent personality disorder is diagnosed when there is a lifelong pattern of
excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive, clingy behavior and fears of
separation.
