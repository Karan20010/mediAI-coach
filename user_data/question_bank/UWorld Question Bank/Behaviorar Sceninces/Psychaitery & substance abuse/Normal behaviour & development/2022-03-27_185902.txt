A 3-year-old boy is brought to the office by his parents due to behavioral difficulties. His
mother says, "He is physically healthy and affectionate but has become more defiant and often
resists our instructions about getting ready for bed. He plays roughly with his 6-year-old
brother and throws tantrums when he has to share his toys or put them away." His preschool
teacher describes him as an “active child" who sometimes talks out loud to classmates while
the teacher is speaking. He is easily distracted and often gets up to walk around the
classroom. The patient is able to draw circles, speak 3-word sentences, go up stairs with
alternating feet, and use the toilet but cannot wipe himself. His parents express concern about
his inability to dress himself and about his bed-wetting that occurs approximately twice a
week. Physical examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely
explanation for the child's behavior?

© A. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(©) B. Conduct disorder
©, C. Developmental delay

©) D. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder
