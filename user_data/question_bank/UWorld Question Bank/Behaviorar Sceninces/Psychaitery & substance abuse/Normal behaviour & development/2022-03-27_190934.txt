(Choice E) Reaction formation is the unconscious transformation of an unacceptable impulse
or emotion into its opposite (eg, if this patient tells her physician she enjoys clinic visits and
acts extremely relaxed during the examination to defend against underlying anxiety).

(Choice F) Regression is a defense mechanism that involves unconsciously reverting to a
less mature way of coping with difficulties (eg, if this patient starts sleeping with a stuffed
animal to manage anxiety about an upcoming appointment).

Educational objective:

Classical conditioning involves a neutral stimulus being repeatedly paired with a non-neutral
stimulus that elicits a reflexive, unconditioned response. Over time, the formerly neutral
stimulus is able to evoke a conditioned response by itself in absence of the non-neutral
stimulus.
