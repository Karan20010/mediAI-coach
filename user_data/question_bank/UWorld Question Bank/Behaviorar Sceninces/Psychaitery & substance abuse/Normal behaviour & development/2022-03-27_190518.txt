dysphoria. Further evaluation and professional support might be warranted in this child if he
had a more persistent desire to be the opposite sex or disliked his own genitalia.

(Choice E) Children usually know their gender by age 4 and understand that it is permanent
by age 5-6.

Educational objective:

Although children understand the concept of gender by age 4, it is normal for them to explore
activities culturally associated with the opposite gender. In contrast, gender dysphoria is
diagnosed when there is marked distress associated with a prolonged and intense feeling that

one is a different gender from one's birth sex.
