procrastination, and purposeful inefficiency.

(Choice C) Projection is a defense mechanism that involves misattributing one's own
unacceptable feelings to another person (eg, a woman who is angry with her mother accuses
her mother of being angry with her).

(Choice D) Reaction formation is a defense mechanism in which uncomfortable feelings are
unconsciously transformed into their extreme opposites (eg, if this resident was excessively
gracious to the patient to defend against underlying anger).

(Choice E) Regression is a defense mechanism that involves returning to an earlier level of
functioning to alleviate psychological distress (eg, a child starts sucking his thumb after a
sibling is born).

(Choice F) Transference refers to the redirection of a patient's emotions from a significant
person in the past to that patient's current physician or therapist. It may explain some patients’
emotional responses to their physicians (eg, an elderly patient who feels an immediate sense
of comfort and familiarity with a physician who resembles her daughter). Transference is
distinguished from countertransference by describing the patient's reaction to the provider,
whereas countertransference refers to the provider's reaction to the patient.
