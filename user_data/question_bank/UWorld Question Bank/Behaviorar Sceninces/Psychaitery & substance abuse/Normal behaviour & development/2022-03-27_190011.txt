improve long-term asthma symptoms or to prevent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is
unlikely to be a major motivating factor.

(Choice B) Although learning about role models (eg, famous athletes) with asthma might be
helpful, similar peer behavior is more likely to decrease this patient's embarrassment about
using an inhaler in the school setting.

(Choice C) Physician education about the patient's illness is unlikely to be as strong a factor
in adherence as peer acceptance. As adolescents strive to become more independent, they
may rebel against authority figures, including physicians.

(Choice F) Although parental attitudes and support are important in helping adolescents
maintain adherence, making the patient feel responsible for causing his mother's concern is
inappropriate and unlikely to facilitate adherence.

Educational objective:

Adolescents have low treatment adherence rates due to issues with autonomy, rebellion
against authority, increased self-consciousness, and a lack of understanding of potential risks.
Peer behavior has a strong influence on adherence due to adolescentsâ€™ desire to fit in with
their social groups.
