This patient's redirection of his anger from his wife to the receptionist is an example of the
defense mechanism displacement. In displacement, emotions are unconsciously
transferred from their actual target to someone or something else that is less threatening.

In this case, the patient is angry with his wife but cannot express it directly as it may impact the
child custody proceedings. Instead, he unconsciously transfers the emotion to the
receptionist, resulting in his angry outburst over a minor incident.

(Choice A) Acting out refers to the expression of unacceptable thoughts or impulses through
actions (eg, if this patient were to react to his wife's pursuit of full custody by vandalizing her
Car).

(Choice B) In denial, an individual avoids awareness of external realities that are difficult to

face (eq, if this patient were to insist that his marriage is conflict-free).

(Choice D) In intellectualization, an individual focuses on nonemotional aspects of a
distressing situation to make it more tolerable (eg, if this patient were solely preoccupied with
thinking about the legal, not the emotional, aspects of his divorce).

(Choice E) Reaction formation involves transforming unacceptable feelings into their opposite
(eg, if this patient, who is angry at his wife, were to act in an overly loving manner toward her).
