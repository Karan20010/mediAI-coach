(Choice B) Dissociation is an immature defense in which a transient disruption to memory,
identity, and/or consciousness occurs as a way to cope with a distressing event (eg, this
student does not remember taking the exam and feels numb when her peers discuss the
questions).

(Choice C) Intellectualization is an immature defense mechanism that involves focusing on
nonemotional components of a distressing event to make it more tolerable (eg, this student
becomes preoccupied with thinking about the passing rates and other statistics of the exam).

(Choice D) Rationalization involves making excuses for unacceptable feelings or situations
(eg, a student explaining that poor performance on an exam was due to the trickiness of the
questions).

(Choice E) Reaction formation involves unconsciously transforming an unacceptable thought
or feeling into its opposite (eg, a student hiding fears of failing the exam by being overly
confident).

Educational objective:
Suppression is a mature defense mechanism involving a conscious choice not to dwell on a
particular thought or feeling.
