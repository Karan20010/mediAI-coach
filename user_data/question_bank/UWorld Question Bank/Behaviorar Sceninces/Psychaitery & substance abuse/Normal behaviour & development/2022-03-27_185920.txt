This boy's behavior is most consistent with age-appropriate behavior. His motor, language,
and social skills are within normal range for a 3-year-old. A short attention span, increased
motor activity (eg, difficulty staying seated), occasional impulsivity (eg, speaking out of turn,
tantrums when toys are taken), and oppositional behavior at bedtime are consistent with

normal developmental variation in young children.

Due to the overlap of normal behavior in preschoolers and symptoms of attention-deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), this diagnosis is not given before age 4-5 (Choice A). If
symptoms of inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsivity continue and persist through
kindergarten and cause impairment in at least 2 settings (eg, school and home), then further
evaluation for ADHD and other behavioral disorders is appropriate.

(Choices B and F) In conduct disorder, the basic rights of others or major societal norms are
violated (not seen in this patient). This boy's oppositional behavior at bedtime and fighting with
his sibling are common at his age. Assisting parents to set consistent limits with age-
appropriate consequences can be helpful in managing this behavior. The diagnosis of
oppositional defiant disorder is reserved for children and adolescents with a persistent pattern

of irritability, defiance, and vindictiveness.

(Choice C) This patient's developmental milestones are on track. Children are not expected
