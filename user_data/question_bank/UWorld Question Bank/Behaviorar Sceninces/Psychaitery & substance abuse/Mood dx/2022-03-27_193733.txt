This patient initially had symptoms of major depressive disorder (ie, loss of interest, low
energy, weight loss, insomnia, impaired concentration) and was most likely prescribed an
antidepressant (eg, sertraline) as first-line therapy. Three weeks later in the emergency
department, she exhibits symptoms of mania (ie, decreased need for sleep, increased energy,
reckless spending, and grandiosity). All antidepressants carry a risk of inducing mania in
susceptible patients. Antidepressant-induced mania can occur early in the first few days or
weeks of starting the medication (even before the time frame normally expected for an
antidepressant to take effect).

In this case, the mother's history of severe mood swings suggests a family history of bipolar
disorder that places the patient at increased risk for developing this disorder. If a patient
becomes manic or hypomanic on antidepressant therapy, the antidepressant should be
stopped.

(Choices A, C, and F) Carbamazepine, lithium, and valproate are mood stabilizers used in
acute episodes and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. This patient presented with
depression, with no known history of bipolar disorder at that time. A mood stabilizer would not
have been the initial first-line treatment.
