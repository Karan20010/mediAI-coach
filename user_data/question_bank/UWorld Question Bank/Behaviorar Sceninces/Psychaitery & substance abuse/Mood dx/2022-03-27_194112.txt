completed suicide 3 times more often. Suicide risk is highest in individuals who have never
married, followed by those who are widowed, separated, or divorced.

(Choices D and E) A history of adverse childhood experiences (eg, abuse, parental discord,
parental substance abuse) and a family history of suicide increase the risk of suicide, most
likely due to both environmental and genetic factors.

(Choice G) Psychiatric illness, especially when associated with hopelessness, is a strong
predictive factor for suicide. Of patients who die by suicide, 90% have a diagnosable
psychiatric disorder at the time of death. Increased severity of illness and recent discharge
from psychiatric inpatient care are additional risk factors.

Educational objective:
Suicide risk assessment includes consideration of both risk and protective factors. A history of
a previous suicide attempt is the strongest single risk factor for further attempts and completed

suicide.
