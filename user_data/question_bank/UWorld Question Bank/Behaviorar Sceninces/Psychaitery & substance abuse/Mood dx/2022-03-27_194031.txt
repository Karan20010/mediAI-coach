Question Id: 1193
This patient's history of major depression along with his current manic symptoms (ie,
decreased need for sleep, grandiosity, goal-directed activity) indicate a diagnosis of bipolar
disorder. Valproate (valproic acid) is used as an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer. It
blocks voltage-gated sodium channels and enhances the availability of GABA. As a mood
stabilizer, it is used in acute mania and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. As an
anticonvulsant, it effectively treats absence, myoclonic, and generalized tonic-clonic
seizures. It is the drug of choice for myoclonic seizures and a second-line agent for
absence seizures (for which ethosuximide is preferred).

Other anticonvulsants used as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder include carbamazepine and
lamotrigine. Carbamazepine is a CYP450 inducer that can cause lower levels of concomitant
medications. Lamotrigine is associated with skin rash, which rarely can progress to life-
threatening mucocutaneous reactions (eg, Stevens-Johnson syndrome).

(Choice A) Aripiprazole is a second-generation antipsychotic used to treat psychotic and
mood disorders. Antipsychotics are not indicated for seizures and may lower the seizure
threshold.

(Choice B) Citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant.
SSRI monotherapy is avoided in bipolar disorder due to the risk of inducing mania. SSRIs
