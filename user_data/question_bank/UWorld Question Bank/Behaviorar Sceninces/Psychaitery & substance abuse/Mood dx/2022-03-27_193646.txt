movements). The sudden onset of a spasm in a specific muscle group is more consistent with
a dystonic reaction.

(Choice B) Conversion disorder (functional neurologic symptom disorder) is characterized by
neurologic symptoms (eg, weakness, abnormal movements, nonepileptic seizures) that are
inconsistent with known neurologic disease. It would not be diagnosed in a patient whose
abnormal movements are readily explained by a medication reaction.

(Choice D) Symptoms of opioid withdrawal include gastrointestinal distress, lacrimation,
rhinorrhea, myalgias/arthralgias, and yawning. These symptoms are not present in this patient
and opioid withdrawal would not explain her tongue protrusion.

(Choice E) Patients with psychotic agitation may exhibit unusual movements and postures.
However, the abrupt onset of tongue protrusion following administration of haloperidol is more
likely explained as an acute dystonic reaction.

Educational objective:

Acute dystonic reaction is characterized by sudden, involuntary contraction of a major muscle
group. Itis a type of extrapyramidal symptom and a common adverse effect of antipsychotic
medications, particularly high-potency, first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol.
