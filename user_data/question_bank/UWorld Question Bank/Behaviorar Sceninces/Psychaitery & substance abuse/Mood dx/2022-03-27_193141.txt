(Choices B, C, and E) Clonidine, hydralazine, and metoprolol do not alter renal ion exchange
or cause volume depletion and therefore do not cause lithium toxicity.

Educational objective:

Chronic lithium toxicity (eg, confusion, ataxia, neuromuscular excitability) can be precipitated
by volume depletion and drug interactions with thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
