This patient is likely experiencing an acute dystonic reaction in response to administration of
haloperidol, a high-potency, first-generation antipsychotic. Acute dystonic reactions are a type
of extrapyramidal symptom (EPS) thought to result from D2 antagonism in the nigrostriatal
pathway. The condition develops abruptly within hours to days after receiving antipsychotic
medication and is characterized by sudden involuntary contraction of a major muscle
group (eg, this patient's tongue protrusion and facial grimacing). Other examples include
torticollis (neck muscle contraction), oculogyric crisis (forced, sustained elevation of the eyes in
an upward position), opisthotonus (arching of the back with the head thrown backward), and,
rarely, laryngospasm.

Treatment of dystonic reactions consists of medications with anticholinergic properties (eg,
diphenhydramine, benztropine), which alter cholinergic signaling in the striatum to decrease
spontaneous movement. In addition to acute dystonia, other types of antipsychotic-induced
EPS include akathisia (inner restlessness) and drug-induced parkinsonism (tremor, rigidity,
bradykinesia, masked facies).

(Choice A) Catatonia is a motor disturbance seen in severe psychiatric or medical illness

characterized by inability to move normally and resulting in either marked reduction in
movements (eg, immobility, stupor) or marked agitation (stereotypy, hyperkinetic limb
