A 36-year-old woman comes to the office for follow-up of a mood disorder. The patient has a
history of several depressive episodes that started in her twenties. Two years ago, she was
hospitalized after staying up for several nights without sleeping and claiming that she had
special powers to "end global poverty and climate change." Her symptoms responded well to
treatment and she has remained on the same drug regimen since then. However, the patient
now has new-onset constipation, dry skin, and hair loss. She is also concerned about a weight
gain of 2.27 kg (5 Ib) over the last 3-4 months despite eating healthy, low-calorie foods. Blood
pressure is 110/70 mm Hg and pulse is 55/min. The patient appears tired, but physical
examination is otherwise normal. The diagnosis is established and her current condition is
attributed to adverse effects from one of her medications. Which of the following is the most
likely culprit drug?

(©) A. Carbamazepine
© B. Citalopram
©) C. Clozapine

©) D. Lamotrigine
