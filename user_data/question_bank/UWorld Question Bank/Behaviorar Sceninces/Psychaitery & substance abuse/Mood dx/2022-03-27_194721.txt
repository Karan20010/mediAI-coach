Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (eg, phenelzine, tranylcypromine) are antidepressants

that work by inhibiting oxidative deamination, thereby increasing the presynaptic availability of
serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Due to their risk of severe adverse effects (eg,
hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome), MAOIs are not considered first- or second-line
antidepressant treatments. However, MAOls are still useful in certain situations when other
antidepressants fail. In addition to their role in treatment-resistant major depressive
disorder (MDD), there is some evidence to suggest that they are superior to other classes of
antidepressants in the treatment of MDD with atypical features.

MDD with atypical features is characterized by mood reactivity (ie, mood improves in
response to positive events), leaden paralysis (ie, patient's arms and legs feel extremely
heavy), rejection sensitivity (ie, overly sensitive to slight criticism), and the reversed
vegetative signs of increased sleep and appetite. This patient is both treatment-resistant
(failure of multiple antidepressant agents) and has atypical features, making him a good
candidate for a trial of an MAOI.

(Choices A and C) The presence of psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and

delusions would be consistent with MDD with psychotic features. This subtype of MDD
requires the addition of an antipsychotic as it is unlikely to respond to an antidepressant alone.
