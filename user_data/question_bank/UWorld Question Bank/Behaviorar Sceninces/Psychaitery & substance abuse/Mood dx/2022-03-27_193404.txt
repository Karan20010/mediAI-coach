(T4) replacement and does not require discontinuation of lithium therapy.

Long-term lithium therapy is also associated with adverse effects on renal function (eg,
nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy), requiring regular
monitoring of blood lithium levels and renal function (blood urea nitrogen and creatinine).
