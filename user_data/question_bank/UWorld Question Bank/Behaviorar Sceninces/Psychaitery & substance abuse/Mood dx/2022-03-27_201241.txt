(Choice B) Tolerance refers to diminished response to a drug with repeated use. This patient
has not yet developed an effective therapeutic response.

(Choice E) Difficulties with medication adherence should always be considered in a patient
who is not responding to medication. However, this patient discloses that he is thinking about
stopping the medication; therefore, there is no reason to suspect that he has already done so.

(Choice F) Treatment-resistant depression is commonly defined as failure to respond to at
least 2 adequate antidepressant trials. This patient cannot be considered treatment resistant
because he has had an inadequate trial of a single medication.

Educational objective:
Antidepressants (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) take 4-6 weeks to achieve
