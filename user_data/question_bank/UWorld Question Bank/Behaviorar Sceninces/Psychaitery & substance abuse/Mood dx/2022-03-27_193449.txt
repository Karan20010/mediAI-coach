Lithium, a mood stabilizer used to treat bipolar disorder, has a narrow therapeutic index and is
excreted by the kidneys. As a result, drugs or medical conditions that affect kidney function or
compete with lithium for clearance may interfere with lithium excretion and lead to toxicity.
This patient's acute gastrointestinal upset followed by the development of neurologic
symptoms (ie, confusion, coarse tremors, ataxia) is consistent with lithium toxicity.

The most likely cause of lithium toxicity in this patient is a drug interaction with a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), such as ibuprofen. NSAIDs decrease renal blood flow and
lithium clearance, increasing serum lithium levels. Other drugs that increase lithium levels and
the risk for toxicity include thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, tetracyclines, and
metronidazole. Lithium levels should be monitored closely in patients taking these
medications.

(Choices A, C, and E) Acetaminophen, ondansetron (5-HT; antagonist), and tramadol (opioid
agonist) do not impair renal clearance of lithium and therefore are not associated with an
increased risk for lithium toxicity.

(Choice D) Although prednisone can precipitate neuropsychiatric symptoms (eg, confusion,

emotional lability, akathisia), it does not increase the risk for lithium toxicity because it does not
interfere with kidney function or lithium clearance.
