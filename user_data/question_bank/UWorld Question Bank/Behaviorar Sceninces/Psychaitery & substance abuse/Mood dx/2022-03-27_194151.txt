Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, inhibit the reuptake of
norepinephrine and serotonin and are used in the treatment of depression. They also inhibit
fast sodium channel conduction, slowing down myocardial depolarization and potentially
leading to cardiac arrhythmias in overdose. Refractory hypotension results from
decreased cardiac contractility and direct peripheral vasodilation (from peripheral alpha-1
adrenergic receptor antagonism). Most deaths from TCA overdose are due to cardiac
arrhythmias and refractory hypotension.

Treatment of TCA overdose involves sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO.) therapy. NaHCO,
increases serum pH, promoting TCA dissociation from sodium channels, and increases
extracellular sodium concentration. These effects help overcome the sodium channel
blockade induced by TCAs.

(Choice A) TCAs cause antihistaminic effects by antagonizing histamine (H1) receptors. This
can cause increased sedation and appetite but is not implicated in death from TCAs.

(Choice C) TCAs block the amine reuptake pumps within the synaptic cleft, which normally
terminate amine transmission. This permits a longer interaction between the neurotransmitter
and the receptor, which is thought to account for TCA antidepressant properties. However,
synaptic norepinephrine accumulation is not the mechanism by which death occurs following
