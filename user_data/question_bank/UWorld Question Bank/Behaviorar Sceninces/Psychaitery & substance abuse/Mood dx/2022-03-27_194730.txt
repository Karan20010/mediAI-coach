(Choice B) Many antidepressants, including MAOIs, have sexual side effects that can worsen
preexisting sexual dysfunction. Bupropion and mirtazapine are antidepressants that do not
cause sexual side effects.

(Choice D) Memory impairment would be a relative contraindication for use of an MAOI.
Patients taking MAOIs must be cognitively intact and remember to avoid tyramine-containing
foods and drug-drug interactions that could lead to a hypertensive crisis or serotonin
syndrome.

(Choice F) Rapid speech is a possible manic symptom that would raise concern about the
presence of mixed depressive and manic symptoms. Antidepressants, particularly MAOIs, are
not indicated for patients exhibiting mixed features.

Educational objective:

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are particularly useful in patients with treatment-resistant major
depressive disorder with atypical features. Increased appetite and sleep, leaden paralysis,
rejection sensitivity, and mood reactivity are hallmarks of the atypical subtype.
