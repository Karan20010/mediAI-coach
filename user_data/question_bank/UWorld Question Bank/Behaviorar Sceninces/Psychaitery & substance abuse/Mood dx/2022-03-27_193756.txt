Bupropion is an antidepressant that works by inhibiting the reuptake of norepinephrine and
dopamine. It is commonly used to treat major depression and is often preferred by patients
because it does not cause weight gain or sexual side effects.

Seizures are a potential side effect of bupropion therapy, especially when the medication is
given at high doses. The risk is even greater in patients with pre-existing seizure disorders or
eating disorders with potential electrolyte imbalances. Bupropion is therefore contraindicated
in patients with seizure disorders or current or prior diagnosis of bulimia or anorexia
nervosa. This patient's possible food restriction and excessive exercise suggest the
possibility of an eating disorder, and the increased seizure risk with a higher dosage of
bupropion would be of primary concern.

(Choice A) Agranulocytosis is a side effect related to treatment with the antipsychotic
clozapine. The mood-stabilizing agents carbamazepine and valproate can also be associated
with bone marrow abnormalities.

(Choice B) Bupropion has minimal effects on blood pressure. The serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine has been associated with increased blood pressure, especially
at higher doses.
