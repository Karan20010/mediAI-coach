additional property of serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonism, which underlies their lower risk of
extrapyramidal side effects. An antipsychotic would not be appropriate monotherapy for major
depression without psychotic features.

(Choice C) Inhibition of sodium channels, resulting in stabilization of neuronal membranes, is
the mechanism of action of some antiepileptic drugs (eg, carbamazepine). These drugs also
have a role as mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder but are not a primary treatment for unipolar
major depression.

(Choice E) Inhibition of monoamine oxidase is the mechanism of action of monoamine
oxidase inhibitors used in treatment-resistant depression. These drugs are not used as first-
line therapy due to their dietary restrictions and risk of serious adverse events (eg,
hypertensive crisis, serotonin syndrome).

(Choice F) Benzodiazepines work to potentiate the effects of GABA, the major inhibitory
neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, by facilitating the increased frequency of
chloride channel opening in the GABAA receptor. They have sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic,
