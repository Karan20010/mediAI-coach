A 34-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his wife after she found him
running around the yard in his underwear shouting, "| am going to change the world." She
reports that he has a lot of energy despite hardly sleeping for the past 7 days, and that he
recently quit his job to write a 500-page novel that he says "explains everything about the
universe." The patient's history is significant for epilepsy with generalized seizures since
childhood and a psychiatric hospitalization a year ago for a major depressive episode. Family
history is significant for alcoholism and hypertension in his father and schizophrenia in his
grandmother. Which of the following medications would be most helpful for long-term
treatment of this patient's psychiatric condition as well as his seizure disorder?
