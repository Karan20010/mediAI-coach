(Choice D) Although alcohol use increases the risk for suicide by impairing judgment, this
teenager does not acknowledge that he has an alcohol problem and may not be willing to start
counseling at this time. Removing access to weapons is a more immediate measure.

(Choice E) Although decreasing this patient's isolation and improving his future prospects by
helping him return to school is important in the long term, limiting access to firearms is the
most pressing concern.

(Choice F) Chronic illness involving pain is a strong risk factor for attempted suicide.
Although the patient's Lyme disease should be treated to prevent further disability, removal of
access to firearms is more likely to prevent a completed suicide at this stage.

Educational objective:

Access to firearms greatly increases the risk of completed suicide. Evaluation of a patient's
access to guns is a key part of suicide risk assessment. Other interventions to reduce suicide
risk include decreasing stress, increasing psychosocial support, treating psychiatric illness and
substance use, and managing pain.
