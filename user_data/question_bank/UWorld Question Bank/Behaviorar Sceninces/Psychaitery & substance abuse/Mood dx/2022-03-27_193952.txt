least 2 weeks after MAO inhibitor discontinuation before initiating SSRI therapy, thereby
allowing sufficient time for regeneration of the MAO enzyme.

(Choice A) Monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors are G protein—coupled receptors.
Internalization of activated G protein-coupled receptors plays a role in downregulating
postsynaptic signal transduction when synaptic monoamine levels are chronically increased.
However, this is not the reason for the 2-week washout period from phenelzine, which is
required to resynthesize the irreversibly inhibited MAO enzyme.

(Choice B) Inositol monophosphatase inhibition is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms
by which lithium exerts its antidepressant and antimanic effects. Inositol monophosphatase is
not affected by MAO inhibitors.

(Choice C) MAO inhibition arrests the breakdown of monoamines, thereby increasing their
release into the synaptic cleft. Overall MAO functioning gradually increases after
discontinuation of irreversible MAO inhibitors (eg, tranylcypromine, phenelzine) as new MAO is
synthesized.

(Choice D) Increased monoamine neurotransmission due to antidepressant treatment causes

downregulation of postsynaptic monoamine (eg, serotonin) receptors, decreasing their density
within the synaptic cleft. This (along with other chronic, downstream neuromodulatory
