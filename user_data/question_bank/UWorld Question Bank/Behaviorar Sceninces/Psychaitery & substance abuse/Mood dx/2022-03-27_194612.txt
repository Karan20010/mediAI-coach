This patient's several-week history of depressed mood, loss of interest, fatigue, impaired
sleep, poor concentration and appetite, and thoughts of death is consistent with major
depressive disorder. The major neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of
depression are thought to be serotonin and norepinephrine (and dopamine to a lesser extent).
Most available antidepressant medications affect serotonin or both serotonin and
norepinephrine at the synapse.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line antidepressants that work
by inhibiting the serotonin transporter (SERT) protein, which is normally responsible for
transporting serotonin out of the synaptic cleft back into the presynaptic neuron. The inhibition
of SERT prevents the normal reuptake of serotonin, resulting in increased availability of
serotonin in the synaptic cleft.

(Choices A and B) These receptor activities are the primary mechanisms of action of
antipsychotics used mainly to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders and to
augment antidepressants in the treatment of mood disorders. Potent antagonism of dopamine
2 receptors is the mechanism of action of first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol.
Second-generation antipsychotics have comparatively less affinity for D2 receptors and the
additional property of serotonin 5-HT2 receptor antagonism, which underlies their lower risk of
