This patient was most likely treated with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), a
commonly prescribed initial treatment for major depressive disorder that causes sexual
dysfunction in up to 50% of patients. SSRI-related sexual side effects include decreased
libido, decreased arousal, anorgasmia, and increased ejaculation latency.

Bupropion is an antidepressant that does not cause sexual dysfunction. Itis classified as
a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Because of its stimulating effects, bupropion is
useful in treating depression associated with hypersomnia and low energy. Bupropion is also
preferred because it causes less weight gain compared with other antidepressants.

Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa, and seizure
disorders because it lowers the seizure threshold.

(Choices B and D) Citalopram and sertraline are SSRIs that would likely cause sexual
dysfunction in this patient. Switching to a non-SSRI such as bupropion is more likely to
improve his sexual dysfunction.

(Choice C) Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant with numerous side effects, including
sexual dysfunction. These types of antidepressants are dangerous in overdose because of
cardiotoxicity, so they are not a first-line treatment for depression.
