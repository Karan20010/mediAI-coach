(Choice E) Persistent depressive disorder is diagnosed when depressive symptoms have
lasted 22 years. It includes both pure dysthymia and chronic major depression.

(Choice F) Some women with mood disorders report that their symptoms worsen before their
menstrual periods. However, in premenstrual dysphoric disorder, depressive symptoms must
remit with the onset of menses and the diagnosis must be confirmed by daily prospective
ratings over several cycles.

(Choice G) In substance-induced depressive disorder, a substance (eg, drug of abuse,
medication, toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The extent of
this patient's substance use makes it an unlikely cause of her depressive disorder.

Educational objective:
Patients with sufficient depressive symptoms are diagnosed with major depressive disorder
even if there is a clear psychosocial stressor that precipitated the depression.
