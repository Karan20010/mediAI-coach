This patient's 2-month history of low energy, weight gain, insomnia with early morning
awakening, impaired concentration (forgetfulness), and loss of interest is most consistent
with major depressive disorder (MDD). Some individuals with MDD do not report feeling
depressed due to poor recognition or concerns of stigma and may come to their primary care
physicians with excessive worry over physical health, pain symptoms (eg, muscle aches,
abdominal cramps, headaches), and other somatic symptoms (eg, fatigue, sleep
disturbance, appetite change). When medical illness has been ruled out, MDD should be
considered high in the differential diagnosis of patients with these symptoms.

(Choice A) Some signs and symptoms of MDD are identical to those of a general medical
condition (eg, weight loss in cancer, fatigue in hypothyroidism). Depressive disorder due to
another medical condition is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical
examination, or laboratory tests that the symptoms can be entirely explained by the
physiologic mechanism of another illness. This patient's unremarkable physical examination
and normal laboratory results make MDD more likely.

(Choice B) Patients with MDD can have worry and psychomotor agitation (eg, restlessness,
fidgeting); however, generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by multiple worries, not just
health anxiety, lasting 26 months.
