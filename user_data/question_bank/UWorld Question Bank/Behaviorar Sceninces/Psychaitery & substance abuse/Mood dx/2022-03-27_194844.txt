This patient's symptoms (eg, depressed mood, feelings of worthlessness, low energy,
insomnia, weight loss, and poor concentration) lasting 22 weeks meets the criteria for major

her hypothyroidism is adequately controlled with levothyroxine and would not be considered a
medical cause of her depression (Choice C).

Patients with sufficient depressive symptoms are diagnosed with MDD even if there is a clear
