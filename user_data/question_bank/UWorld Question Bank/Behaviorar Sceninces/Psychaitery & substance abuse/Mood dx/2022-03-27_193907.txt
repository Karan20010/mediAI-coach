Suicide is a major public health issue that is linked to approximately 1 million deaths worldwide
each year. It is the second leading cause of death, after accidents, in those aged 15-24.
Suicide risk management involves controlling modifiable factors that decrease the risk of
suicide, such as decreasing stress, improving psychosocial support, treating psychiatric illness
and substance abuse, managing pain, and limiting access to firearms or other means of self-
harm. Other risk factors are static and cannot be modified. These include age (teenagers and
the elderly), male sex, family history of suicide, and history of previous attempts.

Individuals with access to firearms have 3 times the risk of suicide completion, as suicide by
firearm is associated with a higher fatality rate compared to other methods. Due to the
impulsivity often associated with suicide in teenagers, limiting this patient's access to firearms
is the most important next step to decrease his risk.

(Choice B) Treatment for this patient's depression should be offered. However, the next step
is to advise his mother to lock away her firearm, so that the risk of completed suicide is
decreased while treatment takes effect.

(Choice C) Providing the mother with assistance could decrease the patient's burden in the
long term but is not an immediate intervention.
