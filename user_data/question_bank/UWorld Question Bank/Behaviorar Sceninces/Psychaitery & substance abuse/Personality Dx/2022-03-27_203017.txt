(Choice E) Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive worry about multiple

issues and is associated with irritability, restlessness, muscle tension, fatigue, sleep

an

disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. This patient's anxiety is more consistent with
avoidant personality disorder because it revolves around a fear of judgment by others and
feelings of inadequacy, resulting in a pattern of social avoidance.

(Choice F) Paranoid personality disorder involves a pattern of distrust and suspiciousness of
others' motives. Patients with this disorder also avoid relationships and socialization, but do
so because they are concerned about personal information being used to exploit them.

(Choice G) Individuals with schizoid personality disorder are also socially avoidant, but they
tend to be content with their social isolation. Patients with this disorder are emotionally
detached, have a limited range of affect, do not desire social acceptance, and prefer to be
alone.

Educational objective:
Avoidant personality disorder is a maladaptive pattern of behavior characterized by social
inhibition, feelings of inadequacy, and fear of embarrassment and rejection.
