This patient's distrust, suspicion about the surgeon's motives, and lack of sustained
relationships are suggestive of paranoid personality disorder. Patients with this disorder
exhibit a pattern of pervasive distrust of others beginning in early adulthood. These
individuals tend to have minimal interpersonal relationships due to doubts about others'
intentions and concerns that personal information will be used against them.

Although paranoid personality disorder involves paranoid interpretations of benign comments
and events, it can be differentiated from psychotic disorders by the lack of persistent, well-
developed delusions and other psychotic symptoms (eg, hallucinations, disorganized speech
or behavior).

(Choice A) Antisocial personality disorder is characterized by a pattern of disregard for, and
violation of, the rights of others.

(Choice B) Although onset of brief psychotic disorder (21 psychotic symptoms lasting 21 day
and <1 month) is usually sudden and in the context of a stressor, this patient's pattern of
pervasive distrust of others started well before his appendectomy and is more consistent with
paranoid personality disorder.
