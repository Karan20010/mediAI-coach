(Choice D) Both borderline and histrionic personality disorders are characterized by attention-
seeking behavior, but this patient's excessive anger and self-destructive behavior are more

characteristic of BPD.

(Choice E) This patient has insufficient symptom quantity and duration for a diagnosis of
major depressive disorder (MDD). In MDD, 25 of the following symptoms are present for 22
weeks: depressed mood, sleep disturbances, anhedonia, guilt, decreased energy,
concentration difficulty, appetite changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, and suicidality.

(Choice F) Patients with BPD may experience transient, stress-related paranoid ideation but
do not exhibit the pervasive pattern of distrust and suspiciousness characteristic of paranoid
personality disorder.

(Choice G) This patient's alcohol misuse is a consequence, not the cause, of her behavioral
disturbance.

Educational objective:

Borderline personality disorder is characterized by a persistent pattern of unstable
relationships, mood lability, and impulsivity. Individuals with this disorder may exhibit suicidal
ideation or behavior in the context of an interpersonal crisis in which they feel rejected or
abandoned.
