This patient's depression, suicidal ideation, and impulsivity in the setting of feeling rejected are
characteristic of borderline personality disorder (BPD). Individuals with this disorder exhibit
a persistent pattern of unstable and intense relationships beginning in adolescence or early
adulthood. They experience marked mood reactivity to interpersonal stresses and frequently
alternate between extremes of idealizing and devaluing others (defense mechanism of
splitting). Difficulty controlling anger, impulsivity (eg, substance use, unsafe sex), recurrent
suicidality, and self-mutilating behavior (eg, cutting, burning) are common. Individuals with
BPD frequently seek clinical attention due to suicidal behavior or threats during an
interpersonal crisis and comprise approximately 20% of psychiatric inpatients.

(Choice A) Although bipolar II disorder and BPD can have similar clinical features, this patient
has insufficient symptom quantity and duration to diagnose discrete episodes of hypomania
and major depression required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. BPD is characterized by
transient mood shifts and impulsive behaviors that occur in response to environmental triggers
(eg, relationship breakup).

(Choice C) Individuals with dependent personality disorder fear abandonment but respond to
relationship strain by trying to appease others, versus being impulsive and having uncontrolled
anger as seen in BPD.
