(Choice D) Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by severe, persistent
irritability in childhood, accompanied by frequent verbal and/or aggressive outbursts. This
diagnosis is usually restricted to individuals age <18.

(Choice E) Intermittent explosive disorder also consists of recurrent impulsive and destructive
outbursts, but they are neither premeditated nor related to achieving secondary gain (eg, profit,
intimidation).

(Choice F) Although this patient exhibits some grandiosity, lack of empathy, and exploitative
behaviors that are also characteristic of narcissistic personality disorder, these would not
explain his lifelong pattern of involvement in violent and/or criminal activities.

(Choice G) Oppositional defiant disorder similarly consists of irritability and vindictiveness as
well as a lack of personal accountability for behaviors. However, individuals with this disorder
do not have a pattern of engaging in criminal activities.
