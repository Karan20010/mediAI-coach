This patient's operation of an illegal dog-fighting ring, unstable employment history, irritability
with coworkers, and repeated tardiness to work are most consistent with a diagnosis of

antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). This disorder is characterized by a pattern of

i

disregard for and violation of the rights of others, beginning by early adolescence and
persisting into adulthood (age 218 required for diagnosis). An essential feature for diagnosis
of ASPD is evidence of conduct disorder prior to age 15 (eg, this patient's history of truancy
and vindictive behavior toward his teacher).

Individuals with ASPD display consistent irresponsibility along with impulsivity and
irritability, which may result in physical aggression. Engagement in criminal activities (eg,
theft, illegal occupations) and lack of remorse for transgressions are typical in this disorder.

(Choice B) Borderline personality disorder also consists of a pattern of impulsivity and
manipulation. These individuals have marked emotional lability, tend to be less physically
aggressive, and display exploitative behaviors that are often driven by abandonment fears as
opposed to personal gain and/or profit.

(Choice C) When individuals with conduct disorder continue to display a pattern of violating
the rights of others into adulthood (age 218), they are diagnosed with ASPD.
