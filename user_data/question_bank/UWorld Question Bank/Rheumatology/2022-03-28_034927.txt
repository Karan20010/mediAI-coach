This patient has pain over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, suggesting lateral
epicondylitis (ie, tennis elbow). Lateral epicondylitis is classically seen in tennis players due
to repetitive wrist extension (backhand strikes) transmitting sudden, extreme forces through
the lateral epicondyle.

The lateral epicondyle serves as the primary attachment point for extensor carpi radialis
brevis and extensor digitorum, which are the primary muscles involved in wrist extension.
Overuse of these muscles can cause repetitive microtrauma of the tendons at their origins on
the lateral epicondyle, leading to angiofibroblastic tendinosis (ie, excess fibroblasts and
neovascularization) without a significant inflammatory infiltrate. This results in swelling and
pain over the lateral epicondyle and proximal extensor tendons.

Overuse of the wrist flexor muscles can cause medial epicondylitis (ie, golfer's elbow), which
occurs by a similar process in the tendons of the flexor muscles near their attachment on the
medial epicondyle (Choice F).

(Choice A) Adduction of the fingers is primarily accomplished by the palmar interosseous
muscles, which originate on the metacarpals.

(Choice B) Flexion of the forearm is primarily accomplished by the biceps brachii, brachialis,
