A 46-year-old man comes to the office due to skin lesions on his left hand and arm that
developed over the past several days. He first noticed a small papule on his left hand that has
increased in size. Additional nodules then appeared proximally on his arm. The lesions are
not particularly painful. The patient has never had similar symptoms. He has had no fever
and otherwise feels fine. He has no significant medical history, takes no medications, and has
no allergies. Temperature is 37.1 C (98.8 F). The lesions are shown in the image below.
