This patient has a displaced fracture of the distal clavicle, a commonly fractured bone. The
clavicle is the only bone affixing the upper extremity and shoulder girdle to the thorax, and it
can be subjected to significant forces during an injury, such as a fall onto the shoulder or
outstretched arm.

Because of their attachments on the clavicle, numerous muscles can apply tension on the
proximal or distal bone fragments of a clavicle fracture. The anterior portion of the deltoid
muscle originates on the distal clavicle and inserts onto the humerus. Normally, this part of
the muscle acts to abduct, flex, and medially rotate the humerus. However, in a distal clavicle
fracture, deltoid muscle tone and the weight of the upper extremity act to pull the distal
fragment in the inferolateral direction. The proximal segment of the bone is pulled in the
superomedial direction by the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The net effect is to
displace the fracture, which increases the risk of nonunion.

(Choice A) The biceps brachii originates on the supraglenoid tubercle (long head) and
coracoid process (short head) of the scapula. It inserts onto the radial tuberosity and bicipital
aponeurosis of the forearm.

(Choice C) The levator scapulae originates on the C1-C4 vertebrae and spans to the
superomedial scapula. This muscle raises the scapula and rotates the acromion inferiorly.
