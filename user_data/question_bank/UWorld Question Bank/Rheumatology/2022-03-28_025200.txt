The rotator cuff is made up of the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis,
and teres minor muscles. These tendons, along with the tendon of the long head of the biceps
brachii muscle and the ligaments of the glenohumeral joint, contribute to shoulder stability.

In rotator cuff syndrome, the most commonly injured tendon is the supraspinatus as this
tendon is prone to repeated impingement trauma between the humeral head and the
acromion, especially in abduction. The supraspinatus is primarily an abductor of the arm; it
originates in the supraspinous fossa of the scapula and inserts on the superior portion of the
head of the humerus. Therefore, supraspinatus tendinopathy is associated with pain on
abduction of the humerus, especially resisted active abduction.

(Choice B) Adduction of the humerus is accomplished by several muscles, including the
latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, coracobrachialis, subscapularis, and teres major and minor.

(Choice C) Extension of the humerus is accomplished primarily by the latissimus dorsi,
posterior deltoid, and teres major.

(Choice D) Flexion of the humerus at the shoulder is accomplished primarily by the pectoralis

major, coracobrachialis, biceps brachii, and anterior deltoid.

(Choice E) Internal rotation of the humerus is accomplished by the subscapularis muscle, ctivate V
