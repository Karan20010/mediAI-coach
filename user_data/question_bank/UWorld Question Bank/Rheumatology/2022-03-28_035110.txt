Educational objective:

Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) occurs due to disruption of the macrovasculature or
microvasculature of bone. The femoral head is the most common location. Sickle cell disease
can cause osteonecrosis due to the thrombotic occlusion of arteries. Other major risk factors
include embolic disorders, high-dose systemic corticosteroids, excessive alcohol use,
vasculitis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus), and femoral neck fracture.
