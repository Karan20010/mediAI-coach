ago, he suffered an injury during a football game. The patient was running with the football

aspect of his left shoulder. He developed severe pain immediately and did not return to the
game. The patient has had persistent shoulder pain since the injury despite using ice and

12 over-the-counter ibuprofen. He has been unable to resume playing football due to pain and
weakness in his shoulder. On examination, there is diffuse bruising over the posterior aspect
