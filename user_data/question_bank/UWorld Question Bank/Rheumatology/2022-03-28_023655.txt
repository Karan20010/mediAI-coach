Question Id: 1159

keratinocytes in the stratified squamous epithelium to attach to the basal lamina.

(Choice C) Intermediate junctions (zonula adherens) are a delicate network of cytoplasmic
filaments that radiate from the cell membrane to hold adjacent cells together. Intermediate
junctions are the second component of the junctional complex.

(Choice E) Desmosomes are small, circular, adherent patches circumferentially placed
around cells that comprise the third component of the junctional complex. These patches are
particularly common in stratified squamous epithelium and contribute significantly to the
structural cohesiveness of tissues subject to mechanical stressors.

Educational objective:

Osteocytes have long intracanalicular processes that extend through the ossified bone matrix.
These cytoplasmic processes send signals to and exchange nutrients and waste products with
the osteocytes within neighboring lamellae via gap junctions. Osteocytes can sense
mechanical stresses and send signals to modulate the activity of surface osteoblasts, thereby
helping to regulate bony remodeling.
