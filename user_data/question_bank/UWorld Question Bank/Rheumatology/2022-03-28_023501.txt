Prototype Soleus Triceps

The body's muscles are composed of 2 main fiber types: slow twitch (Type |) and fast twitch
(Type Il). Type | fibers perform actions requiring low-level sustained force (eg, postural
maintenance) and function primarily via aerobic metabolism, meaning they have high
myoglobin (oxygen storage) and mitochondrial (aerobic respiration) concentrations. The
soleus muscle of the lower leg and paraspinal muscles of the back are postural muscles
predominantly composed of Type | fibers.

Type Il fibers are specialized for generating rapid forceful movements and they fatigue
quickly. These fibers derive ATP energy mainly via glycogenolysis and subsequent
anaerobic glycolysis. Muscles that maneuver the upper extremities (Choices A, B, C, and
E) are primarily geared toward rapid forceful movements and are more likely to have a higher
percentage of Type II than Type | muscle fibers.

Educational objective:
Postural skeletal muscles such as the soleus and paraspinal muscles contain predominantly
Type |, slow twitch muscle fibers that derive ATP primarily via oxidative (aerobic) metabolism.
