and in those with other risk factors for osteoporosis (eg, low body weight, smoking).

Medications that reduce bone formation (eg, glucocorticoids) can also increase the risk of
osteoporosis. Because estrogen plays an important role in bone density, medications that
decrease estrogen production (eg, aromatase inhibitors, GnRH agonists) can increase
osteoporosis risk. In addition, anticonvulsants that induce the cytochrome P450 system in the
liver (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine) can increase catabolism of vitamin D and lead to lower
bone density. Levetiracetam does not induce the P450 enzyme system and has not been
shown to negatively affect bone mineral density in adults (Choice C).

(Choice A) Statins (eg, atorvastatin) do not increase the risk of osteoporosis, and some
studies have noted increased bone density in patients taking these medications.

(Choice B) Thiazide diuretics (eg, chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide) increase reabsorption
of calcium in the distal renal tubule and are associated with a small decrease in the risk of
osteoporosis.

(Choice D) Beta blockers (eg, metoprolol) may slightly decrease the risk of osteoporosis,
possibly due to increased formation and decreased resorption of bone.

(Choice E) Nitrates (eg, nitroglycerin) have been associated in some studies with increased
