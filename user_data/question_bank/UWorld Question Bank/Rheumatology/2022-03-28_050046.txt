This patient has pain and deformity of the long bones with hearing loss (due to bony deformity
of the skull); these are typical features of Paget's disease of bone. The initial abnormality in
Paget's disease is excessive osteoclastic bone resorption followed by increased bone
formation by osteoblasts; this results in high bone turnover in the affected areas. The new
bone formation is disorganized, and pagetic bone lesions typically appear on imaging as

thickened areas of mixed sclerosis and lucency.

Osteoblasts are cells with a single nucleus that arise from mesenchymal stem cells found in
the periosteum and bone marrow. In contrast, osteoclasts originate from the mononuclear
phagocytic cell lineage and are ultimately formed when several precursor cells fuse to create a
multinucleated mature cell. Osteoclasts in Paget's disease are typically very large and can
have up to 100 nuclei (normal osteoclasts have 2-5). The 2 most important factors for
osteoclastic differentiation, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor for
activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L), are produced by osteoblasts and bone
marrow stromal cells.

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a physiologic decoy receptor that decreases binding of RANK-L to
RANK. Inhibition of RANK-L to RANK receptor interaction reduces the differentiation and
survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density
