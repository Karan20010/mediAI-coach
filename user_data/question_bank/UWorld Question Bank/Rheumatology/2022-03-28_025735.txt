(myosin) (actin) ©UWorld
A sarcomere is composed of overlapping filaments of actin and myosin as well as structural
and binding proteins (eg, titin, a-actinin). A single sarcomere is defined as the distance
between two Z lines. Thin (actin) filaments are bound to structural proteins at the Z line.
The unbound ends of the actin filaments project into the middle of the sarcomere, where they
interact with thick (myosin) filaments during muscle contraction.

(Choice B) The Aband corresponds to myosin filaments in the sarcomere. In this region,
there are myosin filaments overlapped with actin filaments as well as non-overlapped myosin
filaments. The A band always remains the same length during muscle contraction.

(Choice C) The M line lies at the center of the A band and is where myosin filaments anchor
to structural elements in the center of the sarcomere.

(Choice D) Myosin and actin filaments overlap at the segment of the sarcomere between the
H and | bands.

(Choices E and F) The | band is the region of the sarcomere in which actin does not overlap
with myosin, and the H band is the region in which myosin does not overlap with actin. During
muscle contraction, both H and | bands decrease in length.
