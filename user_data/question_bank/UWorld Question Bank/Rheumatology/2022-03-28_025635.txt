infections are almost always seen in severely immunocompromised patients (eg, AIDS).

(Choice C) Mycobacterium marinum is an uncommon pathogen that causes infection
following inoculation of a wound with contaminated freshwater or seawater. Most cases are
marked by a solitary papule that ulcerates, but nodular lymphangitis can occasionally occur.
However, acid-fast bacilli, not yeasts, would be seen on culture.

(Choice D) Prolonged antibiotic use can disrupt mucocutaneous flora, leading to Candida
infection. Although Candida is a yeast that buds, it generally causes intertriginous infection
marked by erythematous plaques and erosions. Nodular lymphangitis would be uncommon.

(Choice E) Feline flea bite can transmit Bartonella henselae, the cause of catscratch
disease. Patients often develop a papule at the inoculation site, but the major symptom is
extremely tender regional lymphadenitis. Gram-negative rods, not yeasts, would be seen on
culture.

Educational objective:

Sporothrix schenckii is a dimorphic fungus that exists as yeasts at body temperature. Itis
found in decaying plant matter and soil and is usually transmitted via cutaneous or
