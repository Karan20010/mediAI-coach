Educational objective:

Ankylosing spondylitis presents with chronic back pain with reduced spinal mobility. X-rays of
the spine and pelvis can aid in diagnosis by identifying specific findings such as sacroiliitis (eg,
joint erosions with subchondral sclerosis and eventual ankylosis) and bridging
syndesmophytes (heterotopic ossification affecting vertebral body margins).
