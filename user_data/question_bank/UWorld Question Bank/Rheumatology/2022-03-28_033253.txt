innate immunity and migration of immune cells to the skeleton. The resulting skeletal
manifestations are most prominent in areas of mechanical stress, primarily at the
insertions of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules (collectively, entheses) on bone.

Enthesitis is a relatively specific finding in AS and other forms of spondyloarthritis and is
characterized by local pain, tenderness, and possible swelling. Common clinical syndromes
include Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, and dactylitis ("sausage digits"). Achilles
tendinitis affects the site of insertion of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneus and typically
presents with severe pain at the posterior aspect of the heel.

(Choices A and D) Peripheral arthritis is common in AS. In these cases, the inflammatory

process largely affects the articular cartilage and subchondral bone; synovial involvement is
typically minor. However, the pain is typically felt within the ankle (eg, tibiotalar and subtalar
arthritis) rather than at the posterior aspect of the foot.

(Choice B) Injury to the cortical bone of the calcaneus can occur acutely due to a high-
velocity fall or crush injury or chronically due to a stress fracture in athletes who run on hard
surfaces. This patient's inflammatory back pain makes enthesitis a more likely cause of his
heel pain.
