Educational objective:

The ulnar nerve can be injured at the medial epicondyle of the humerus ("funny bone") or in
Guyon's canal near the hook of the hamate and pisiform bone in the wrist. Patients often have
sensory loss over the medial 1% digits and hypothenar eminence, and weakness on wrist
flexion/adduction, finger abduction/adduction, and flexion of the fourth/fifth digits. The
hypothenar eminence may flatten due to muscle atrophy.
