arterial supply for the femoral head.

(Choice A) Achondroplasia is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by severely
restricted chondrocyte proliferation in growth plate cartilage and decreased endochondral
ossification. The shortened limbs and other features of this disorder are usually apparent in
childhood.

(Choices B and E) The chronic joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated
with the formation of synovial pannus, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial
cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells. At the same time, the affected joints undergo
a cytokine-mediated increase in bone resorption with loss of subchondral bone that is visible
on x-ray as periarticular erosions. Although RA can affect the hip, it typically affects the small
joints of the hand and wrist; hip monarthritis is rare.

(Choice C) Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is characterized by bony erosions with excessive bone
regrowth driven by overproduction of cytokines (eg, IL-17, IL-22, TNF-alpha). AS can affect
the hip, but most patients have chronic back and sacroiliac pain; large-joint monarthritis is rare.
