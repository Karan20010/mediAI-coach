The sciatic foramen is a pelvic opening serving as the major pathway for pelvic neurovascular
structures to the lower limbs. It is divided into greater and lesser sciatic foramina by the
sacrospinous ligament (Choice E). The greater sciatic foramen is bordered anterolaterally
by the greater sciatic notch of the ilium, inferiorly by the ischial spine and sacrospinous
ligament, superiorly by the anterior sacroiliac ligament, and posteromedially by the
sacrotuberous ligament (Choice F).

The piriformis originates on the anterior aspect of the sacrum and occupies most of the space
in the greater sciatic foramen. It inserts on the greater trochanter of the femur and acts to
externally rotate the thigh when extended and abduct the thigh when flexed. Structures
running above the piriformis include the superior gluteal vessels and superior gluteal nerve.
Structures crossing below the piriformis include the inferior gluteal vessels, internal pudendal
vessels, and multiple nerves (most notably the sciatic nerve). Muscle injury or hypertrophy
can compress the sciatic nerve to cause sciatica-like symptoms (eg, pain, tingling, and
numbness in the buttocks and along the nerve distribution) known as piriformis syndrome.
The muscle can be tender with deep palpation or on stretching with adduction and internal

rotation. aivetiov
