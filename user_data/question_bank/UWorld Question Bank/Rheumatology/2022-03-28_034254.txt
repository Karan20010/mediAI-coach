Prompt reduction of the dislocated lunate is required to prevent permanent damage to the
median nerve.

(Choices A and D) The deep motor branch of the ulnar nerve is responsible for both finger
abduction due to innervation of the dorsal and volar interossei and thumb adduction due to
innervation of the adductor pollicis. The ulnar nerve is susceptible to acute compression at the
wrist (ie, Guyon canal syndrome) when the hook of the hamate is fractured.

(Choice B) Branches of the median and ulnar nerves in the forearm innervate the flexor
digitorum superficialis and profundus muscles that control finger interphalangeal joint flexion.
These branches arise and innervate their respective muscles prior to the carpal tunnel and
Guyon canal and would not be affected by wrist trauma.

(Choice E) The radial nerve innervates the extensor pollicis longus and brevis, which control
thumb extension. All radial nerve—innervated muscles are located proximal to the wrist and
therefore would not be affected by lunate dislocation.

Educational objective:

Volar dislocation of the lunate from its normal position within the floor of the carpal tunnel can
cause median nerve compression and/or injury. Median nerve injury at the level of the carpal
tunnel may result in weakness of thumb abduction, flexion, and opposition. PCEVENO
