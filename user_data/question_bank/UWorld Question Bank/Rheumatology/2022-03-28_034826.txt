A 72-year-old man comes to the primary care clinic with a 6-month history of back and bilateral
thigh pain provoked by walking. He normally can walk only 2-3 blocks before having to stop
due to pain. However, when he is out walking with his grandchild, leaning on the stroller
seems to provide pain relief. The patient also notices an occasional tingling sensation in his
lower extremities. He has no prior trauma or history of rheumatologic disorders. On physical
examination, muscular strength is normal and the sensory findings are unremarkable.
Peripheral pulses are full and symmetric. Thickening of which of the following ligaments is
most likely contributing to this patient's current presentation?

A. Anterior longitudinal (10%)

B. lliolumbar (15%)

C. Interspinous (11%)
YD. Ligamentum flavum (31%)

E. Sacroiliac (30%)
