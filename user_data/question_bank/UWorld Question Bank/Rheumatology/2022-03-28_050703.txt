fractures, rather than cortical thickening.

(Choice C) The erythrocyte sedimentation rate reflects circulating levels of inflammatory
proteins and is elevated in many inflammatory and malignant conditions. It is classically
elevated in polymyalgia rheumatica; this condition causes pain in the shoulders, hips, and
proximal extremities, but x-rays are normal. It can also be strikingly elevated in multiple
myeloma, which can cause osteolytic lesions resembling early pagetic lesions but does not
cause cortical thickening.

(Choice D) Hyperparathyroidism can present with bone pain, typically in association with
hypercalcemic manifestations (eg, constipation, renal stones). X-ray of the vertebral column
reveals cortical thinning, not thickening.

(Choice E) Prostate-specific antigen is used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Bone
metastasis in prostate cancer appears on x-ray as focal sclerotic lesions, and most patients
have palpable nodules on prostate examination.
