Educational objective:

Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy characterized by simultaneous
erosion of bone and new bone formation. Bone erosions occur primarily in vertebral bodies;
however, new bone formation typically occurs at the junction of the periosteal margin and
adjacent cartilage, leading to bridging syndesmophytes and ankylosis. This causes spinal
rigidity, postural alterations, and increased risk of fracture.
