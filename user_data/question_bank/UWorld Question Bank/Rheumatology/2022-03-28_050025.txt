Educational objective:

Thiazide diuretics increase calcium absorption in the distal convoluted tubules within the
nephron. Thiazides are associated with increased bone mineral density and are
recommended for treatment of hypertension in patients at risk for osteoporosis. Loop diuretics
increase urinary calcium loss.
