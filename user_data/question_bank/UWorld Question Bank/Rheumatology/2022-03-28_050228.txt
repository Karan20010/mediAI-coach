This patient with skeletal pain, deformity (ie, bowing of the legs), and focal warmth has Paget
disease of bone (osteitis deformans). Paget disease is a chronic disorder characterized by
excessive and disordered bone formation. The affected bone becomes weakened, which can
lead to bone pain, bowing, fracture, or arthritis of adjacent joints. Increased blood flow in
pagetic lesions can be apparent as local warmth or bruits and can occasionally lead to high-
output heart failure.

Patients with Paget disease frequently have an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level
due to increased formation of new bone. However, calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid
hormone levels are normal, as calcium homeostasis remains intact by the disease process.
X-rays are usually diagnostic, showing mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions, thickening of cortical
and trabecular bone, and bony deformities.

Educational objective:

Paget disease of bone is characterized by disordered bone formation. Involvement of long
bones can lead to bone pain, bowing, fracture, or arthritis of adjacent joints. Serum alkaline
phosphatase is elevated due to increased production of new bone, but calcium and
phosphorus levels remain normal.
