A 24-year-old woman comes to the office due to a persistent facial rash. The patient easily
develops "sunburns" after sun exposure and her fingers "turn blue" in cold weather. She has
also felt more fatigued than usual. Physical examination shows a facial rash in a butterfly
distribution that spares the nasolabial folds. Laboratory studies reveal several types of
autoantibodies directed against components of the cell nucleus. One specific antibody targets
proteins complexed with small nuclear ribonucleic acid. These protein-ribonucleic acid
complexes are most likely involved in which of the following cellular functions?
