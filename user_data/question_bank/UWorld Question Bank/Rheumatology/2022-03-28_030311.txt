‘of the myosin crossbridge fro
[Without this ATP, muscle will be
fixed in a contracted state (rigor
mortis)}

According to the model posited by Rayment et al., the role of ATP in skeletal and cardiac
muscle contraction may be to release the myosin head from its actin binding site and then to
energize a conformational change that resets the myosin head to "contract" again the next
time it binds to actin.

(Choices A and B) Calcium binding to troponin C shifts ttopomyosin away from the myosin
binding site on actin. These steps do not depend directly on ATP.

(Choice D) If ATP is not available, the cross-bridge between myosin and actin will persist (rigor
mortis).

(Choice E) Myosin light chain kinase phosphorylates the myosin light chain, activating myosin
to bind actin filaments in smooth muscle cells. There is no myosin head phosphorylation by a
specific kinase in skeletal muscle contraction.

Educational Objective:
During the skeletal muscle contraction cycle, ATP binding to myosin causes release of the

myosin head from its binding site on the actin filament.
