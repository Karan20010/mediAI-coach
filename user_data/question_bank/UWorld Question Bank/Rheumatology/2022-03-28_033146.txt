Early Lyme disease causes flu-like symptoms and erythema chronicum migrans. The second
stage of Lyme disease may involve atrioventricular block and facial palsy. Late Lyme disease
can cause chronic asymmetric large joint arthritis and encephalopathy. Lyme disease is easily
treated with doxycycline or penicillin-type antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone).
