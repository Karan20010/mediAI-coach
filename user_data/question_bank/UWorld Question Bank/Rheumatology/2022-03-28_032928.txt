Gout is a disease caused by tissue deposition of monosodium urate crystals. Elevated uric
acid levels are a known risk factor for gout and increased purine metabolism is one possible
cause of hyperuricemia. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) synthetase is the enzyme
responsible for the production of the activated ribose necessary for de novo synthesis of
purine and pyrimidine nucleotides. The mutation described in the question stem will cause
increased production of purines due to feed-forward activation of the purine synthesis
pathway. As a result, more purine molecules will undergo degradation, resulting in
hyperuricemia and an increased risk of gout.

(Choice A) The aorta can develop aneurysms in patients with Marfan syndrome, which results
from defects in fibrillin-1.

(Choices B and D) The heart and liver can be affected by glycogen storage diseases
resulting from a variety of enzyme deficiencies such as glucose-6-phosphatase deficiency (von
Gierke disease) and acid maltase deficiency (Pompe disease).

(Choice E) The pancreas is affected in patients with cystic fibrosis, which results from a
mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Common
sequelae include pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, and destruction of islet cells.
