the contracting extrafusal skeletal muscle fibers. When a muscle actively contracts against
resistance, the increase in tension is transmitted through the tendon activating the GTOs in the
process. In contrast, GTOs are relatively insensitive to changes in muscle length because the
lengthening that occurs when a muscle is passively stretched takes place primarily in the
muscle fibers and not in the tendon.

The Ib sensory axons from the GTOs contact inhibitory interneurons in the spinal cord, which
in turn synapse with the a motor neurons that innervate the same muscle. Thus, the Golgi
tendon circuit is a negative feedback system that regulates and maintains muscle tension.
When a muscle exerts too much force, the GTOs inhibit contraction of the muscle, causing
sudden muscle relaxation. This prevents damage to the musculoskeletal system.

(Choice A) A-delta fibers are thin, myelinated nerve fibers whose free nerve endings detect
temperature and nociceptive stimuli. They are associated with acute (sharp) pain and
constitute the afferent portion of the reflex arc that mediates withdrawal from noxious stimuli
(e.g., retracting the hand away from a hot stove).

(Choice C) In contrast to the in-series arrangement of GTOs, muscle spindles (intrafusal
muscle fibers) are connected in parallel with extrafusal fibers. They are innervated by group la
and group II sensory axons and are sensitive to changes in muscle length. Muscle spindles
