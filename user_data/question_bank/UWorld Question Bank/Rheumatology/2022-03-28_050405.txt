(Choice A) Glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) cause osteoporosis because they inhibit
proliferation and differentiation of osteoblast precursors and increase apoptosis of mature
osteoblasts. Fragility fractures may occur, but this patient's deformities are more consistent
with rickets.

(Choice B) The early osteolytic phase of Paget disease of bone is characterized by
proliferation of abnormally large, hypernucleated osteoclasts. Paget disease causes bone
pain and deformity (eg, frontal bossing, bowing of long bones) but findings are typically focal
and asymmetric and usually occur in adults age >50.

(Choice C) Replacement of bone with disorganized fibrous connective tissue (fibrous
dysplasia) can occur in a single bone (eg, femur) or multiple bones (polyostotic). Polyostotic
fibrous dysplasia (McCune-Albright syndrome) is typically associated with café au lait macules
and pituitary endocrine disorders (eg, precocious puberty, thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly).

(Choice D) Osteosarcoma, the most common malignant bone tumor in children, is
characterized by excessive production of mineralized bone. The lesions are typically single
and would not cause short stature, frontal bossing, or enamel defects.
