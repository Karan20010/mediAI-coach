(Choice B) Anticardiolipin antibodies are typically seen in antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome, which is characterized by recurrent vascular thrombosis and/or pregnancy loss.
This syndrome is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, although it may occur
independently.

(Choice C) Autoantibodies to desmoglein 1 and 3 are seen in patients with pemphigus
vulgaris, which is characterized by skin blistering and desquamation.

(Choices D and G) Antimitochondrial antibodies are seen in patients with primary biliary
cholangitis, which presents with cholestatic symptoms (eg, pruritus, jaundice, steatorrhea) and
abnormal hepatic enzyme levels. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are seen in autoimmune
hepatitis, which most commonly presents as chronic progressive hepatitis in middle-aged
women.

Educational objective:

Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are characterized by symmetric proximal muscle weakness

and are associated with antinuclear and anti-tRNA synthetase (anti-Jo-1) autoantibodies.

Biopsy in polymyositis shows patchy endomysial inflammatory infiltrate (ie, direct invasion of

individual muscle fibers), whereas dermatomyositis causes perifascicular inflammation (ie,

localized around blood vessels and the septa between muscle fascicles). ctivate V
