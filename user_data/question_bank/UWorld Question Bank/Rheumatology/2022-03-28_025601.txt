(Choice B) ATP fuels myosin movement along actin filaments (causing contraction) and
drives the pumps that transport calcium back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (causing
relaxation). McArdle disease is one cause of impaired ATP production and occurs due to a
failure of muscle glycogen breakdown.

(Choice C) Impaired relaxation after sustained contraction occurs in myotonic dystrophy due
to a trinucleotide repeat expansion altering myotonin-protein kinase. This protein facilitates
myosin head detachment from the actin filament to enable muscle relaxation; T-tubules do not
play a role.

(Choice D) A mutation in troponin C may block its response to intracellular calcium and
prevent muscle contraction. However, muscle fibers with decreased numbers of T-tubules will
maintain limited contractility.

Educational objective:

Transverse tubules (T-tubules) are invaginations of the sarcolemma that transmit
depolarization signals to the sarcoplasmic reticulum to trigger the release of calcium and
induce muscle contraction. The uniform distribution of T-tubules in striated muscle fibers
ensures that each myofibril contracts at the same time, which is necessary for efficient
contraction.
