This patient with chronic dry mouth and palpable salivary gland enlargement has extensive
lymphocytic infiltrate with a germinal center on salivary gland biopsy, findings consistent with
Sjogren syndrome (SS). SS is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a lymphocytic
inflammatory infiltrate in the exocrine glands. It presents with dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis
sicca) and dry mouth (xerostomia). Extraglandular manifestations such as arthralgia and
cutaneous vasculitis can also occur due to the deposition of circulating immune complexes.

Complications of SS can include corneal ulcerations due to diminished lacrimal gland function
and an increase in dental caries due to diminished salivary gland function. The chronic B-
lymphocyte stimulation in SS also predisposes patients to malignant transformation and
resulting non-Hodgkin lymphoma (eg, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma).

(Choice A) Although inflammatory bowel disease (eg, ulcerative colitis) can be associated
with spondyloarthropathies (eg, low back pain, peripheral arthritis), dry mouth is not a typical
feature; Crohn disease can occasionally involve the salivary glands, but biopsy would show
noncaseating granulomas.

(Choice C) Portal hypertension can be a complication of hemochromatosis, which is
characterized by iron accumulation in the liver (eg, hepatomegaly, cirrhosis), skin (eg,
