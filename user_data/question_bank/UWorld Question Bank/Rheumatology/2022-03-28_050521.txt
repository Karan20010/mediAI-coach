(Choice C) Osteopetrosis is a group of disorders characterized by impaired osteoclast
function. This leads to persistence of the primary spongiosa in the medullary cavity. These
rare disorders typically present early in life with fractures, deformities, and hematologic
cytopenias (due to obliteration of the marrow space).

(Choice D) Bone disease in hyperparathyroidism is characterized by increased bone
resorption in cortical bone with subperiosteal thinning and cystic degeneration (osteitis fibrosa
cystica). However, this is typically seen in advanced cases along with diffuse bone pain and
manifestations of hypercalcemia (eg, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms).

Educational objective:

Initially in osteoporosis, bone loss predominantly affects trabecular bone, leading to trabecular
thinning and perforation with loss of interconnecting bridges. Over time, cortical bone, which
composes most of the appendicular skeleton, also becomes involved.
