(Choice A) Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from any condition that reduces the size of the
carpal tunnel and compresses the median nerve (eg, pregnancy, hypothyroidism). Patients
typically have pain/paresthesias affecting the first 3’2 digits. Thenar atrophy with weakness on
thumb abduction/opposition may also be seen.

(Choice B) The coracobrachialis muscle lies deep to the biceps brachii and is perforated and
innervated by the musculocutaneous nerve. Nerve injury may result in decreased strength on
forearm flexion and sensory loss over the lateral forearm.

(Choice C) Subluxation of the radial head can injure the deep branch of the radial nerve
during its passage through the supinator canal, leading to weakness during finger and thumb
extension ("finger drop").

(Choice E) Fracture of the midshaft of the humerus typically results in radial nerve injury
leading to paralysis of the hand and finger extensor muscles ("wrist drop") with sensory loss
over the posterior forearm and dorsolateral hand.

(Choice F) Fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus may cause axillary nerve injury
leading to paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles with sensory loss over the lateral
upper arm.
