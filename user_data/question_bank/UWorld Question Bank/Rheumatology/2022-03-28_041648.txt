tip of the shoulder and produces swelling and upward displacement of the clavicle. It is usually

not associated with specific nerve injuries/deficits.

(Choice C) Clavicular fractures usually occur following direct trauma to the clavicle. Most
fractures are in the middle third of the clavicle and produce local swelling and tenderness.
Associated neurovascular damage is rare.

(Choice D) Fracture of the coracoid process of the scapula is rare. Individuals who engage in
shotgun- or rifle-related activities are most commonly affected.

(Choice F) Aspiral fracture of the midshaft humerus may result from torsion produced during
a fall on an outstretched arm. Patients have swelling, bone crepitus, and ecchymoses of the
arm. The radial nerve is commonly injured.
