decision now needs to be made whether to initiate long term preventive therapy. Patients who
have only occasional episodes of gout may not need prophylactic treatment. However, uric
acid-lowering medications can be helpful in patients with frequent episodes of gouty arthritis,
chronic joint destruction, uric acid renal stones, or tophi.

In addition to acute gout, this patient has had recurring episodes of likely uric acid stones and
should be considered for prophylactic therapy. The preferred treatment to prevent recurrent
attacks is xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat), which decrease uric acid
production. Prophylactic therapy is usually initiated during intercritical (between attacks)
periods as acute changes in serum uric acid levels can worsen an acute attack.

(Choice A) Septic arthritis can cause an acute monoarthritis but would be unlikely to respond
to analgesics.

(Choice B) Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) act by inhibiting cyclooxygenase.
NSAIDs are the first-line therapy for acute gouty arthritis and can prevent an acute flare while
urate-lowering therapy is started. However, they are not normally used for long-term therapy
due to risk of peptic ulcer.
