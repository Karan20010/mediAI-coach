(Choice B) Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by median nerve compression at the wrist
within the carpal tunnel. It is mostly commonly nontraumatic in origin, but when it does occur
following trauma (eg, fall on an outstretched hand), it is typically due to palmar dislocation of
the lunate into the carpal tunnel space.

(Choice C) Acute compartment syndrome occurs when increased pressure within a fascial
compartment (eg, intracompartmental bleeding, muscle swelling) compromises blood
circulation within that space. It typically develops after significant trauma, particularly long
bone fractures of the leg or forearm.

(Choice D) Dupuyitren contracture is a slowly progressive fibroproliferative disease of the
palmar fascia. Nodules form on the fascia, eventually resulting in contractures that draw the
fingers into flexion.

(Choice E) Guyon canal syndrome is caused by compression of the ulnar nerve at the wrist
within Guyon canal. It can develop following a fall on an outstretched hand but typically occurs
due to fracture of the hook of the hamate, which forms the lateral bony wall of Guyon canal.

Educational objective:
Fracture of the scaphoid bone may result from a fall on an outstretched hand and should be

suspected if examination shows tenderness in the anatomic snuff box. Scaphoid fracture can -—
