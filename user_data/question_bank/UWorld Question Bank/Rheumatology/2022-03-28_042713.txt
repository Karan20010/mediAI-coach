There are two main subtypes of systemic sclerosis: diffuse scleroderma, which is
characterized by diffuse skin and visceral involvement, and CREST syndrome, which is
associated with localized skin involvement and a more benign course. "CREST" is an
acronym for the signs and symptoms: Calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, Esophageal
dysmotility, Sclerodactyly and Telangiectasias. Anti-centromere antibodies are specific for
CREST syndrome and found in 40% of cases. Anti-DNA topoisomerase | (Scl-70) antibodies
are highly specific for systemic sclerosis (diffuse scleroderma).

The patient in the vignette has CREST syndrome. Raynaud's phenomenon causes painful
episodes of pallor, cyanosis, and erythema of the hands in response to cold or emotional
stress. These episodes of vasospasm can last minutes to hours. Esophageal dysmotility is
the result of fibrosis of the distal esophagus with associated esophageal hypomotility. It
manifests with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn and regurgitation).
Sclerodactyly is thickening of the skin of the hands and feet. It begins as non-pitting edema
of the hands and fingers. Later in the course of the disease, the skin becomes thickened, tight
and shiny. Thinning of the skin (atrophy) follows. Telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels)
occur on the skin of the face, hands and upper trunk, and on mucosal surfaces. Calcinosis
