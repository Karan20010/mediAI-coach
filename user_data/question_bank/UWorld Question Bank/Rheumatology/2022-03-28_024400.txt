The deep fascia of the leg, the fascial intermuscular septae, and the interosseous membrane
divide the leg into 4 compartments (anterior, lateral, and superficial and deep posterior). The
fascia is inelastic and limits outward expansion of the contracting muscles. If the pressure in a
compartment increases, the circulation within it can become compromised, leading to severe
pain and eventual tissue ischemia. This complication, acute compartment syndrome (ACS),
can be due to long-bone fractures, crush injury, thermal injury, or nontraumatic causes (eg,
bleeding disorders, vascular disease). Early diagnosis and surgical decompression
(fasciotomy) of the involved compartments are necessary to prevent permanent and disabling
injury (eg, myonecrosis, nerve damage, amputation).

The most common site for ACS is the anterior compartment of the leg, which includes the
foot extensor muscles, anterior tibial artery, and the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve. Injury
to the deep peroneal nerve causes decreased sensation between the first and second toes,
decreased dorsiflexion of the foot, foot drop, and claw foot.

(Choice B) The great (long) saphenous vein starts in the dorsum of the foot and runs along
the medial leg and anterior thigh before merging with the common femoral vein in the femoral
triangle. It is outside the deep fascia and is not vulnerable to ACS.
