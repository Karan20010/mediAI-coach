to pull the actin filament, leading to muscle contraction and ADP release. Anew ATP molecule
then is bound to the myosin head, causing release of the actin filament. The cycle then
repeats until calcium is displaced from troponin C and the myosin binding sites are again
covered (Choice B). The pulse of elevated intracellular calcium lasts only a fraction of a
second before the calcium is resequestered within the SR.

(Choice E) Protein kinase A is activated by high intracellular concentrations of cAMP and is
involved in the second messenger pathways of numerous hormones, including glucagon, beta
adrenergic receptors, parathyroid hormone and others.

Educational objective:
During skeletal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and
binds troponin C, thereby allowing the binding of actin to myosin.
