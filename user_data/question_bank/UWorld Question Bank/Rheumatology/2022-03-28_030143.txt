The patient described in the question stem is experiencing paroxysmal supraventricular
tachycardia. Treatment can be with vagal stimulation, such as carotid sinus massage or the
Valsalva maneuver. Maneuvers that increase vagal tone increase the refractory period in the
AV node and help prevent a reentrant circuit from conducting. If Valsalva measures fail,
intravenous administration of adenosine is recommended.

The Valsalva maneuver is executed by forcibly exhaling against a closed glottis. This is done
by taking a full inhalation, closing the glottis (i.e. holding one's breath), and subsequently
bearing down-without exhaling-as one would during a bowel movement. The rectus muscles
are recruited in this process, and they (Choice A) play the largest role in the development of
the resultant elevated intraabdominal and intrathoracic pressure during this maneuver.

(Choice B) This structure is the iliacus muscle, a flexor of the hip that lies over the iliac fossa.

(Choice C) This structure is the gluteus minimus muscle. This muscle is innervated by the
superior gluteal nerve and has the subtle, but important function of preventing the contralateral
(non-weight-bearing) side of the pelvis from dipping when that leg is elevated off of the ground,
as when one walks.

(Choice D) This structure is the gluteus medius muscle. This muscle has the same

innervation and function as the gluteus minimus.
