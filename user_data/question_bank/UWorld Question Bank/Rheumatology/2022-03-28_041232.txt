Educational objective:

Fracture of the scaphoid bone may result from a fall on an outstretched hand and should be
suspected if examination shows tenderness in the anatomic snuff box. Scaphoid fracture can
disrupt retrograde blood supply to the proximal scaphoid, increasing risk of avascular necrosis.
