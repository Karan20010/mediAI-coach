squamous mucosa. The hyperkeratinized patches appear white against the normal red or pink
mucosa. In the absence of malignant transformation, these lesions are typically
asymptomatic; this patient's dry mouth and dry eye symptoms are more consistent with
Sjogren syndrome.

(Choice C) Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease characterized by painful, flaccid
bullae and erosions of the skin and mucosa. Biopsy of an active lesion will show intraepithelial
cleavage with detached keratinocytes (acantholysis), retained keratinocytes along the
basement membrane, and an eosinophilic inflammatory infiltrate.

(Choice E) Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by noncaseating granuloma
formation in multiple tissues. Pulmonary and constitutional symptoms are common. Ocular
involvement may cause uveitis, but conjunctival erythema and dry eye symptoms are more
consistent with Sjogren syndrome.

Educational objective:

Sjégren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of exocrine
glands. Biopsy of the labial salivary glands shows periductal lymphocytic infiltrates (focal
lymphocytic sialadenitis), often with germinal centers; the glandular tissue is typically atrophic
