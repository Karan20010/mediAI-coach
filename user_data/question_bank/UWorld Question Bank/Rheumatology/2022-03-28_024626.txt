This patient's cubital fossa laceration has resulted in median nerve injury, leading to
impairment of forearm pronation (pronator teres) and proximal interphalangeal joint flexion
(flexor digitorum superficialis), along with sensory deficits in the median distribution. Because
the brachial artery is adjacent to the median nerve at the cubital fossa, injury to the brachial

artery was most likely responsible for this patient's bleeding.

The brachial artery is the continuation of the axillary artery as it extends past the inferior border
of the teres major muscle. In the upper arm, the brachial artery courses in the medial bicipital
groove between the biceps brachii and triceps brachii muscles, giving off multiple branches
(eg, deep brachial artery) and running alongside both the median and ulnar nerves. Proximal
to the elbow, the median and ulnar nerves diverge; only the median nerve accompanies the
brachial artery through the cubital fossa (lateral to the medial epicondyle) into the proximal
anterior forearm, where the brachial artery splits into the radial and ulnar arteries. In contrast,
the ulnar nerve travels posterior to the medial epicondyle.

(Choice A) The anterior interosseous artery runs alongside the anterior interosseous nerve, a
branch of the median nerve that supplies most of the deep volar forearm muscles. The
anterior interosseous nerve and artery originate in the forearm, distal to the cubital fossa.
