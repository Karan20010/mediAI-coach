(Choice C) Hemochromatosis can cause deposition of iron salts within the synovium and joint
space, which can lead to a chronic arthritis resembling osteoarthritis. Although hereditary
hemochromatosis is associated with diabetes mellitus, this patient lacks other characteristic
findings (eg, skin pigmentation, liver dysfunction, cardiac enlargement); in addition,
osteoarthritis is a much more common cause of arthritis in the general population.

(Choice D) Rheumatoid arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with synovial
hyperplasia. It most commonly affects the proximal interphalangeal (PIP),
metacarpophalangeal (MCP), wrist, Knee, and ankle joints. However, patients typically have
symmetric joint involvement and prolonged morning stiffness.

(Choice E) Parvovirus B19 presents in adults as a nonspecific flulike illness, often followed by
a symmetric arthritis most commonly affecting the hands. Symptoms are acute and resolve
within a few weeks.

Educational objective:

Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fissuring and erosion of articular cartilage. Risk

factors include advancing age, obesity, joint trauma, and repetitive stress. Patients may have

mild effusion and crepitus on physical examination, but signs of synovitis (eg, redness,

warmth) are less prominent than in the classic inflammatory arthritic disorders. ctivate V
