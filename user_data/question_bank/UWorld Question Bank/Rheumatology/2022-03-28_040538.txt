encoding the stimulatory a subunit of G protein. This mutation causes constitutive activation of
the G protein/cAMP/adenylate cyclase signaling cascade, which leads to a gain of function of
the affected cells. Persistent G-protein stimulatory activity in melanocytes results in prominent
café-au-lait macules (CALMs). CALMs, usually the first manifestation of MAS, are often

large and unilateral with an irregular, "coast of Maine" border.

In addition, autonomous endocrine function most commonly results in precocious puberty
(onset of secondary sexual development before age 8 in girls). The mutation also results in
increased proliferation of fibroblast-like cells, increased secretion of IL-6, and activation of
osteoclasts (fibrous dysplasia). The term polyostotic refers to the presence of lesions in
many bones, although they are typically unilateral.

(Choice A) Ewing sarcoma typically presents as a single lesion with months of pain and
swelling in one of the long bones of the extremities or pelvis. Multiple layers of periosteal
reaction result in a characteristic "onion peel" appearance on x-ray.

(Choice B) Gaucher disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disease that is most common
among Ashkenazi Jews and may also result in diffuse, painful lytic bone lesions. However, it
leads to delayed puberty and growth.

Choice C) Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is a disease of young children that results in isolated
