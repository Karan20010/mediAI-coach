This patient presents with spinal stenosis, an abnormal narrowing of the spinal canal

occurring most commonly in the lumbar region. Compression of nerve roots results in a

number of neurologic symptoms, including lower extremity pain, numbness/paresthesia,

and weakness. The onset of pain with walking is referred to as "neurogenic claudication" as it

may resemble symptoms seen in vascular claudication. However, the symptoms of spinal

stenosis are posture-dependent. Extension of the lumbar spine (eg, standing, walking

upright) further narrows the spinal canal and worsens the symptoms, whereas lumbar flexion

(eg, walking uphill, leaning on a stroller/shopping cart) relieves the pain.

Degenerative arthritis of the spine is the most common cause of spinal stenosis, typically
occurring in patients age >60. Over time, the intervertebral disc degenerates and begins to
protrude, resulting in a corresponding loss in disc height. This loss of height places a
disproportionate load on the posterior aspect of the spinal column, leading to formation of facet
joint osteophytes and hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum (a strong elastic ligament
supporting the posterior aspect of the spinal canal). These physiologic changes lead to
mechanical compression of nerve roots and corresponding neurologic symptoms.

(Choice A) The anterior longitudinal ligament covers the anterior aspect of the vertebral
bodies, preventing excess spinal extension.
