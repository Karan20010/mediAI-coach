a (Choice C) Mature adipocytes with large, atypical hyperchromatic cells are characteristic

= findings in liposarcoma. These tumors can develop within the lower extremity muscles but are

as rare, typically occur at age >50, and are painless until they cause compression of surrounding

: structures.

(Choice D) Pleomorphic neoplastic spindle cells and new woven bone indicate

22 osteosarcoma. Although this occurs in patients age <20 years, the tumor usually arises in
; = metaphysis (eg, distal femur, proximal tibia), and the mass is not mobile. In addition, this
23 patient had no tumor 2 months ago on x-ray, and it is very unlikely for osteosarcoma to

* develop and progress within 2 months.

(Choice E) A ganglion cyst is an outpouching of synovial structures (eg, joint capsule, tendon
+ 28 sheath) filled with clear, gelatinous fluid. It presents as a painless, rubbery nodule, most
commonly at the wrist or dorsal foot. The thigh muscle is not a common location.

Educational objective:

33 Myositis ossificans is characterized by the formation of lamellar bone in extraskeletal tissues
(ie, heterotopic ossification), often triggered by trauma. It typically presents as a painful, firm,
+ 36 mobile mass within a muscle (eg, quadriceps). Histologic examination shows benign

metaplastic bone and proliferating fibroblasts without mitotic atypia. ctivate V
