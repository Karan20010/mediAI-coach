On exposure to sunlight, 7-dehydrocholesterol (provitamin D3) in the skin absorbs
ultraviolet (UV) B rays. This opens the B ring of 7-dehydrocholesterol, forming previtamin D3,

which then undergoes thermal isomerization to form vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D3

is then hydroxylated in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and subsequently to 1,25-

hydroxyvitamin D (the active form) in the kidneys.

Vitamin D deficiency can lead to osteomalacia with bone pain or tenderness, muscle

weakness or cramps, gait abnormalities, and increased fracture risk. Factors associated with

limited UV exposure and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency include the following:

Reduced time outdoors: elderly individuals, patients living in residential care or who are
frequently hospitalized, people who avoid going outdoors due to high risk of skin cancer
Low UV sun exposure: individuals living at extreme northern or southern latitudes
Predominantly nocturnal lifestyle: shift work or occupations requiring overnight work
Blockade of sunlight exposure: people who use high-grade sunblock or wear full-
coverage clothing

Reduced UV penetration: individuals with heavily pigmented skin

(Choices B and C) The conversion of vitamin D2 and D3 to 25-hydroxycholecalciferol by 25-

hydroxylase in the liver is primarily requlated by feedback inhibition from 25-
