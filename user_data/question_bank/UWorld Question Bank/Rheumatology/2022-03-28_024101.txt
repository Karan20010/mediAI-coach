Histopathology of this patient's proximal tibial lesion is consistent with osteosarcoma, the
most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. Most cases arise
in the metaphyses of long bones (eg, proximal tibia, distal femur), near the growth plate

where bone proliferation is the highest.

Patients typically have localized pain and soft tissue swelling. X-ray often reveals a lytic and
sclerotic bone lesion (due to destruction of existing bone and production of neoplastic bone)
that extends into the surrounding soft tissue. Periosteal elevation (ie, Codman triangle) anda
sunburst periosteal reaction are also common.

Osteosarcomas are thought to arise from mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblastic progenitor
cells. Histopathology shows malignant cells (eg, pleomorphic, hyperchromatic nuclei,
prominent nucleoli) that produce neoplastic osteoid (ie, unmineralized bone matrix
composed of type | collagen) and thin trabeculae of mineralized bone. Treatment typically
includes surgical resection and chemotherapy.

(Choice A) Chondrosarcoma is a malignant, cartilage-forming tumor that typically occurs in

the axial skeleton (eg, pelvis) of patients age >40. Unlike osteosarcoma, it does not produce
neoplastic osteoid or bone. Histopathology shows neoplastic chondrocytes in a cartilage
