Cyclooxygenase (COX), also Known as prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, catalyzes the
conversion of arachidonic acid into prostanoids. It exists in 2 isoforms designated COX-1 and
COX-2. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in various tissues and is involved in a number of
"housekeeping functions" (eg, platelet aggregation, gastric mucosal protection, vascular
homeostasis). COX-2 is an inducible enzyme that is undetectable in most tissues under
normal conditions. During inflammation, infiltrating cells secrete cytokines (eg, interleukin-1,
TNF-a) that cause COX-2 upregulation in the inflamed tissue. COX-2 then drives the
synthesis of pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid metabolites.

This patient's acute gout attack should be treated with an agent that provides prompt pain
relief without exacerbating his gastrointestinal problems. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 and
can cause significant gastrointestinal injury. Selective COX-2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib)
decrease inflammation but have no effect on COX-1, minimizing gastroduodenal toxicity.

(Choice A) Like other NSAIDs, aspirin nonselectively inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin
irreversibly modifies these enzymes; therefore, restoration of enzymatic activity requires
synthesis of new enzymes.

(Choice C) Colchicine binds to tubulin, which inhibits microtubule formation. This results in
