when axial traction is applied to the arm. Affected patients have mild tenderness in the
anterolateral elbow (radial head) that is worsened by forearm supination. Swelling is not seen.

(Choice E) The triceps muscle originates from the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and
posterior humerus and inserts onto the posterior olecranon; it extends the elbow. Triceps
tendon injury leads to pain at the posterior olecranon with elbow extension, and significant
swelling would be atypical.

Educational objective:

Olecranon bursitis presents with localized swelling at the olecranon process. Pain and
erythema are typically minimal or absent unless significant inflammation is present. A bursa is
not an intraarticular structure; therefore, range of motion of the associated joint is typically
preserved and pain-free.
