Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal
pain in association with fatigue and neuropsychiatric disturbances (eg, paresthesias, poor
sleep, depression, difficulty concentrating). It is most common in women age 20-55.
Examination often shows tenderness at characteristic locations in the soft tissues and at bony
prominences. The diagnosis can be made in patients with chronic pain and fatigue for >3
months in the absence of physical or laboratory findings suggestive of an inflammatory
etiology (eg, synovial swelling, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein)
or other chronic pain syndrome.

The precise etiology of fibromyalgia is unknown, but it likely involves abnormal central
processing of painful stimuli. Possible contributing factors include genetic predisposition and
physical or emotional stressors. Although exercise can temporarily exacerbate the pain of
fibromyalgia, gradual incremental aerobic exercise is proven to reduce pain and improve

function. Tricyclic antidepressants and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors modify
processing of pain signals and can also be considered in patients with more severe or
refractory symptoms.
