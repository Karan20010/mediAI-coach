hritides that can cause pain and joint deformation but present with acute, episodic arthritis
id are more common in the lower extremities.
hoice B) Osteoarthritis is characterized by progressive fracturing and erosion of the

icular cartilage. Periarticular findings include osteophyte formation and subchondral
lerosis. When osteoarthritis affects the hands, it typically presents with bony enlargement at

the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints (Bouchard and Heberden nodes, respectively)

her than ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints.

hoice C) Autoimmune complex deposition (type III hypersensitivity) plays a significant role
the arthritis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Although lupus may cause a
ronic destructive arthritis resembling RA in a minority of cases, lupus arthritis is typically
gratory, nondeforming, and much more common in younger women than in older men.

Educational objective:
Joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by synovial hyperplasia, an

inflammatory infiltrate, and synovial angiogenesis. The joint space often becomes replaced by

pannus, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and

inflammatory cells that can erode into the articular cartilage and underlying bone.
