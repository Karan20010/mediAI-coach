This patient has a right lateral ankle sprain, which is most often due to inversion of a plantar-
flexed foot. The ankle is stabilized laterally by the anterior inferior tibiofibular, anterior
talofibular, posterior talofibular, and calcaneofibular ligaments.

The lateral ankle ligaments are weaker and are injured more often than the medial ligaments.
The most common ankle sprains involve only the anterior talofibular ligament and present
with pain and ecchymosis at the anterolateral aspect of the ankle. However, stronger forces
can injure multiple ligaments, leading to significant joint instability with possible nerve injury
and joint dislocation/fracture.

(Choice A) The soleus and gastrocnemius muscles combine to form the Achilles tendon,
which inserts on the posterior calcaneus and acts in ankle flexion. The tendon can be injured
with sudden forces during strenuous activities (eg, sudden pivoting on a foot or rapid
acceleration).

(Choice B) The medial deltoid ligament complex is stronger than the other ligaments and is
not commonly injured. Forced eversion of the ankle can damage the deltoid ligament but more
commonly causes an avulsion fracture of the medial malleolus.

(Choice C) The subtalar joint is at the posterior junction between the talus and the calcaneus

and is reinforced by the talocalcaneal ligaments. The joint is involved with inversion, eversion,
