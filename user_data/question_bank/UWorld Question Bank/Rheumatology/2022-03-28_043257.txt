salivary, lacrimal) glands. It can occur as an isolated disorder or as a manifestation of another
autoimmune syndrome (eg, rheumatoid arthritis). Patients typically have severe dry mouth
(xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca); vaginal gland involvement is also
common.

Characteristic serologic markers of Sjégren syndrome include anti-Ro (SSA) and anti-La
(SSB). Antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor are often positive but less specific.
Biopsy of the labial salivary glands demonstrates intense periductal lymphocytic infiltrates
(focal lymphocytic sialadenitis), often with germinal centers; the glandular tissue is typically
atrophic and fibrotic.

(Choice A) Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by deposition of abnormal
proteins in various tissues (eg, kidneys, heart). Light microscopy shows amorphous
eosinophilic protein deposits; polarized microscopy with Congo red staining may elicit bright
green birefringence.

(Choice B) Oral leukoplakia is a premalignant lesion characterized by hyperplasia of the

mucosa. In the absence of malignant transformation, these lesions are typicall
