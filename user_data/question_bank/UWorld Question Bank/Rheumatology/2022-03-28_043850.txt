GCA is characterized by a T-cell-mediated inflammatory process of medium-to-large arteries.
It may occur diffusely but predominantly affects the arteries of the head and neck, especially
the temporal artery (ie, temporal arteritis). Biopsy of the temporal artery will show scattered,
focal granulomatous inflammation (most pronounced in the media) with intimal thickening,
elastic lamina fragmentation, and giant cell formation (without distinct granulomas). GCA
is histologically identical to Takayasu arteritis, which typically involves the aortic arch and
affects primarily younger patients.

(Choices B and D) Hyaline arteriolosclerosis is characterized by deposition of homogeneous
hyaline material in the intima and media of small arteries and arterioles. It is associated with
diabetes, hypertension, and advanced age. Severe hypertension also results in hyperplastic
arteriolosclerosis, which manifests as onion-like concentric thickening of the walls of arterioles
(eg, laminated smooth muscle cells, reduplicated basement membranes). Both forms of
arteriolosclerosis can cause end-organ ischemic injury. However, the resulting
symptoms/signs would not respond to glucocorticoids.

(Choice C) Medial band-like calcifications are characteristic of M6nckeberg's medial calcific
sclerosis and present as pipestem calcifications on x-ray. They may be associated with
atherosclerosis but do not directly cause symptoms and are usually not clinically significant.
