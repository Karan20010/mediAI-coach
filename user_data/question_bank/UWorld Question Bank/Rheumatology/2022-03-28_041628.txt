This patient with acute traumatic shoulder pain has flattening of the deltoid and paresthesia in

the overlying skin, suggestive of a shoulder joint (ie, glenohumeral) dislocation. The

glenohumeral joint is the most commonly dislocated joint in the body due to the shallow

articulation between the humeral head and the glenoid fossa of the scapula. The humeral

head may dislocate anteriorly, inferiorly, or posteriorly, but anterior dislocations are by far the

most common.

Anterior shoulder dislocations classically follow a blow to an externally rotated and
abducted arm (eg, throwing a football). Common examination findings include flattening of
the deltoid prominence, protrusion of the acromion, and anterior axillary fullness (due to the
humeral head's movement into this location). The axillary nerve is the nerve most commonly
injured by anterior shoulder dislocations. It innervates the deltoid and teres minor muscles
and provides sensory innervation to the skin overlying the lateral shoulder.

Shoulder dislocations are diagnosed on plain x-ray and are treated with prompt closed
reduction, which typically improves the axillary neuropathy.

(Choice A) Acromioclavicular joint subluxation typically results from a downward blow to the
tip of the shoulder and produces swelling and upward displacement of the clavicle. It is usually

not associated with specific nerve injuries/deficits.
