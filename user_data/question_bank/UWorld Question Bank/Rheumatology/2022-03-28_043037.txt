The pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) involves vascular endothelial cells
(increased expression of endothelin 1 and adhesion molecules), T lymphocytes (production of
cytokines that activate fibroblasts), and dermal fibroblasts (increased production of collagen

and ground substance).
