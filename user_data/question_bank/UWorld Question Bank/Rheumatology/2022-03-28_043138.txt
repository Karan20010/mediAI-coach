Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is the most likely diagnosis in this patient with migratory
arthritis, new-onset murmur, fever, and a positive anti-streptolysin O titer. ARF isa
multisystem complication that develops 2-4 weeks after untreated group A streptococcal
pharyngitis. Most organs are often only mildly and transiently affected in ARF, with the
exception of the heart. Acute morbidity is most likely due to pancarditis (inflammation of the
endocardium, myocardium, and epicardium). Inflammation of the mitral valve can lead to
mitral regurgitation, which is the likely cause of the new holosystolic murmur in this patient.
Severe regurgitation and/or myocarditis can lead to cardiac dilation, heart failure, and death
in a small percentage of patients.

(Choice A) Virtually all cases of mitral stenosis are caused by fibrosis of the valve leaflets in
chronic rheumatic heart disease. The fibrosis occurs gradually over years or decades after the
initial episode of ARF and would, therefore, not be an acute complication in this patient.

(Choice C) Acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (PSGN) is caused by circulating
immune complexes following a streptococcal pharyngeal infection with specific nephritogenic
strains. Hematuria, edema, proteinuria, and hypertension are classic findings. This patient
has no symptoms of PSGN, which rarely occurs simultaneously with ARF.

(Choice D) Patients with septic arthritis are often febrile and ill-appearing. Staphylococcus
