24 This patient has a ganglion cyst, a benign, fluid-filled mass that overlies a joint or tendon.
, Ganglion cysts occur most commonly on the dorsal wrist; other common sites include the volar
28 wrist, digits, and feet. They are thought to be due to mucoid degeneration of periarticular
= tissue, leading to outpouching of the connective tissue. Mucinous fluid collects via a 1-way
27 valve mechanism, possibly due to repetitive joint movements, resulting in slow growth of the
