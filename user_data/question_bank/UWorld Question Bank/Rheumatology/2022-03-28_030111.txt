This patient who felt a popping sensation in his right finger while grabbing another player's
jersey has likely ruptured the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) tendon, an injury commonly
called "jersey finger."

The FDP tendon originates from the FDP muscle in the forearm; travels through the carpal
tunnel, palm, and flexor tendon sheath; and inserts onto the base of the distal phalanx. It
contributes to flexion of proximal joints (wrist, metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joint, proximal
interphalangeal [PIP] joint) and specifically causes flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP)
joint. It is typically weakest at its insertion and is susceptible to rupture when the actively
flexed DIP joint (eg, hooked around opponent's jersey) is forcefully hyperextended (eg,
opponent pulls away suddenly). Rupture can occur in any digit, but the ring finger is most
frequently involved.

Patients with FDP tendon rupture commonly have pain and swelling in the affected digit. A
complete tendon rupture, as seen in this patient, results in absent DIP flexion; a partial
tendon tear results in weak, incomplete flexion.

(Choice A) The flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) is a primary flexor of the wrist. FCU tendon injury
results in decreased wrist flexion power; some wrist flexion is maintained by the other wrist

flexors (eg, flexor carpi radialis).
