Mitochondria are responsible for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, which is why

28 mitochondrial defects tend to cause lactic acidosis and primarily affect tissues with the highest
= metabolic rates (eg, neural tissue, muscular tissue). Although many mitochondrial proteins are
27 coded for in the nuclear genome, mitochondria also contain their own genome, which is

* vulnerable to mutations. Each cell has hundreds of mitochondria, and defects in their genome
30 may occur in any number of the mitochondria within the cell. Heteroplasmy describes the

= condition of having different mitochondrial genomes within a single cell. The severity of

33 mitochondrial diseases is often directly related to the proportion of abnormal to normal

= mitochondria within a patient's cells.
