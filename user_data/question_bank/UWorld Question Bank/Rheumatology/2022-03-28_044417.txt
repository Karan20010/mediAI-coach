studies

This patient with proximal muscle weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes that improve
with exercise has Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is an immune-
mediated disorder of the neuromuscular junction characterized by autoantibodies directed at
the presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channel, resulting in decreased acetylcholine
release and muscle weakness. LEMS is strongly associated with small cell lung cancer,
likely due to the immune recognition of voltage-gated calcium channels that are present on the
malignant cells.
