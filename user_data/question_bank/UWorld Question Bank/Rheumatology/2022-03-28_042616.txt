Therefore, pancytopenia (ie, leukopenia, anemia, atl thrombocytopenia) is a common
adverse effect that must be monitored with periodic complete blood count testing.

(Choices B and C) Unlike glucocorticoids, azathioprine has no adverse effects on glucose or
lipid metabolism, an advantage of this medication over chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

(Choice D) Azathioprine has no known effect on lung function. The chemotherapeutic agent
bleomycin may cause pulmonary fibrosis and therefore requires periodic monitoring of
pulmonary function.

(Choice E) The anemia caused by azathioprine and other antimetabolite drugs (eg,
methotrexate) is typically macrocytic (due to impaired DNA synthesis), but this macrocytic
effect is independent of vitamin B,, levels. Proton pump inhibitors and histamine 2 blockers

can disrupt absorption of vitamin B,. and may cause or contribute to its deficiency.

Educational objective:

Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant that functions via inhibition of purine synthesis by its
pharmacologically active 6-thioguanine metabolites. In addition to the desired effect of
reduced lymphocyte proliferation, the proliferation of other hematologic cell lines (eg,
neutrophils, erythrocytes, platelets) is reduced, leading to a common adverse effect of

pancytopenia.
