This patient has Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), a common cause of knee pain in
adolescents due to overuse of the quadriceps muscle group (ie, rectus femoris, vastus
intermedius, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis). The quadriceps is located in the anterior thigh
and is responsible for knee extension. Its tendon initially inserts at the superior pole of the
patella. The tendon envelops the patella and continues as the patellar ligament, which then
inserts at the tibial tubercle. As a result, contraction of the quadriceps (eg, hiking, running)
creates traction on the tibial tubercle.

In skeletally immature children, the tibial tubercle forms as a secondary ossification center
(apophysis) of the tibia, and the cartilaginous nature of the developing tibial tuberosity makes it
more prone to injury compared to fully ossified bone in adults. Repetitive quadriceps
contraction results in chronic avulsion/fragmentation of the tubercle, with corresponding
tenderness and swelling, as seen in this patient.

(Choice A) The biceps femoris, along with the semitendinosus and semimembranosus, forms
the hamstring muscle group in the posterior thigh; it is responsible for hip extension and knee
flexion. The long head of the biceps femoris originates from the ischial tuberosity, whereas the
short head originates from the inferior third of the linea aspera. Both insert at the head of the
fibula.
