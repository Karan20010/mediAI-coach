This patient's synovial fluid analysis shows negatively birefringent crystals (ie, monosodium
urate crystals) under polarized light, which is diagnostic for gouty arthritis. Neutrophils are the
primary cells responsible for the intense inflammatory response seen in patients with gout.
Phagocytosis of urate crystals by neutrophils causes the release of various cytokines and
inflammatory mediators that lead to further neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, resulting in a
positive feedback loop that amplifies the inflammatory response.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line therapy for treating acute gouty
arthritis. They inhibit prostanoid biosynthesis (eg, prostaglandins, prostacyclin,
