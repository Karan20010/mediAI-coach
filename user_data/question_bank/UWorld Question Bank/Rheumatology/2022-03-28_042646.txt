This patient most likely has eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss).
This small to medium vessel vasculitis is characterized by late-onset asthma, rhinosinusitis,
and eosinophilia, though it can involve many other organ systems including the kidneys,
gastrointestinal tract, and cardiovascular system. Asymmetric multifocal neuropathy
(mononeuritis multiplex) is particularly common due to the vasculitis affecting the epineural
vessels (eg, wrist drop due to radial nerve involvement). Other common manifestations
include skin nodules, migratory/transient pulmonary infiltrates, and paranasal sinus
abnormalities. In addition to peripheral eosinophilia, a frequent laboratory finding is
antibodies against neutrophil myeloperoxidase, which most commonly have a pattern of
perinuclear staining (p-ANCA).

(Choice A) Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) can produce an asthma-like
picture with eosinophilia and elevated IgE and IgG serum antibodies to Aspergillus fumigatus.
However, systemic vasculitis and p-ANCA are not commonly associated with ABPA.

(Choice B) Pulmonary involvement in anti-glomerular basement membrane disease presents
with cough, pulmonary infiltrates, and hemoptysis (not asthma-like symptoms). Patients have
circulating autoantibodies against collagen IV, which damage alveolar and glomerular
