Educational objective:

Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized muscular arteries marked by
segmental, transmural, arterial wall inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis. This narrows the
arterial lumen and increases risk of thrombosis and tissue ischemia/infarction. Damage to the
internal and external elastic laminae also increases the risk of microaneurysm. Tissue
damage primarily occurs in the kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, neurologic system, and skin; the

lungs are usually spared.
