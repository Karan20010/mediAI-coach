(Choice E) The radial nerve and deep brachial artery run posterior to the midshaft of the
humerus and may be injured by a fracture at that point. These structures are not typically
injured in a humeral neck fracture.

Educational objective:

The proximal humerus and glenohumeral joint receive their blood supply via the anterior and
posterior circumflex humeral arteries, which are branches of the axillary artery that form an
anastomosis at the neck of the humerus. Humeral neck fractures can disrupt this blood flow,
leading to avascular necrosis of the humeral head.
