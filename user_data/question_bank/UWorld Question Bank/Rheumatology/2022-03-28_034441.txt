This patient's presentation is consistent with ulnar neuropathy. The ulnar nerve is a branch of
the medial cord of the brachial plexus derived from the C8-T1 ventral rami. It enters the
forearm after passing behind the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Within the forearm, it
innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial portion of the flexor digitorum profundus.
The nerve then enters the wrist between the hook of the hamate and the pisiform bone in a
fibroosseous tunnel known as Guyon's canal. Here, it divides into a superficial branch that
provides sensation over the medial 1‘ digits and hypothenar eminence and a deep motor
branch that supplies most of the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

The ulnar nerve is most commonly injured at the elbow ("funny bone") due to trauma or nerve
compression, but it can also be injured at the wrist as it runs through Guyon's canal. Nerve
damage may cause sensory loss in the ulnar distribution with weakness on wrist
flexion/adduction, finger abduction/adduction, and flexion of the fourth/fifth digits. The
hypothenar eminence can appear flattened due to denervated muscle atrophy. Weakness
of the lumbricals in the fourth/fifth digits may also produce an "ulnar claw" deformity during
finger extension.

(Choice A) Carpal tunnel syndrome can result from any condition that reduces the size of the

carpal tunnel and compresses the median nerve (eg, pregnancy, hypothyroidism). Patients
