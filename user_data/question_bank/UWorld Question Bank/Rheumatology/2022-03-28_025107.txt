rotation.

(Choice A) The coccygeus muscle is a pelvic floor muscle anterior to the sacrospinous
ligament and combines with the levator ani to form the pelvic diaphragm.

(Choice B) The gluteus minimus is the smallest of the 3 gluteal muscles and is immediately
beneath the gluteus medius. It works with the gluteus medius to stabilize the hip and abduct
the thigh when the limb is extended.

(Choice C) The obturator internus is a fan-shaped muscle originating from the medial surface
of the obturator membrane, ischium, and pubic rim. It exits the pelvis through the lesser sciatic
foramen and inserts on the greater trochanter of the femur, where it functions similarly to the
piriformis.

Educational objective:

The piriformis passes through the greater sciatic foramen and is involved with external hip
rotation. Muscle injury or hypertrophy can compress the sciatic nerve in the foramen, causing
piriformis syndrome.
