(Choice C) Local infection is the most important cause of delayed wound healing. The delay
results from persistent tissue injury and inflammation and is not known to be specifically
related to excessive matrix metalloproteinase or myofibroblast activity.

(Choice D) Keloids are hypertrophic scars in which excessive collagenous scar tissue
deposited by fibroblasts permanently extends beyond the margins of the original wound.
Keloids are not known to be specifically related to excessive matrix metalloproteinase or
myofibroblast activity.

Educational Objective:

During wound healing, excessive matrix metalloproteinase activity and myofibroblast
accumulation in the wound margins can result in contracture. Contractures produce
deformities of the wound and surrounding tissues, most often on the palms, soles, anterior
thorax, or at serious burn sites.
