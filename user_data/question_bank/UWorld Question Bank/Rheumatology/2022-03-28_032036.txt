HLA-B27 = human leukocyte antigen B27; TNF-a = tumor necrosis factor-alpha; CRP = C-

reactive protein; ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

This patient with chronic pain and stiffness in the spine and reduced spinal mobility likely
has ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The pain in AS is generally better with activity and worse at
night and with rest, which can lead to disrupted sleep and daytime fatigue. AS is characterized
by bony erosions and excessive formation of new bone in the axial skeleton, primarily around
the vertebral margins.

Patients with suspected AS should undergo x-ray of the spine and pelvis, which can assist in
the diagnosis:

e X-ray of the pelvis shows inflammatory arthritis of the sacroiliac joints (ie, sacroiliitis),
visible as joint erosions with subchondral sclerosis. These findings are relatively
specific for spondylarthritis (including AS) and, in association with typical symptoms, are
often adequate for diagnosis. As the disorder progresses, the joint space is obliterated,
leading to bony fusion (ankylosis).

¢ Spinal x-ray may show heterotopic ossification affecting the margins of the vertebral
bodies, which are visible as bridging syndesmophytes. Advanced and continuous
