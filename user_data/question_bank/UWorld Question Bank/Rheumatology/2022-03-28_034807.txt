(Choice A) Osteomyelitis of flat bones (eg, skull, pelvis) is uncommon in children and is

typically caused by contiguous spread of infection (eg, open wound, dental abscess).

Although pelvic bone involvement may lead to refusal to bear weight, this patient has no gross

abnormality of the hips or lower extremities suggesting adjacent soft tissue infection.

(Choice B) Ewing sarcoma typically arises in diaphysis of the long bones, especially the
femur. It is the second most common malignant bone tumor in children after osteosarcoma.
However, Ewing sarcoma typically presents in children age >10 with an insidious onset of
progressive pain, not in toddlers with acute refusal to bear weight.

(Choice C) The physis (growth plate) in children limits vascular connections between the
metaphysis and epiphysis, which is relatively less vascularized, making epiphyseal
involvement uncommon in hematogenous osteomyelitis. Although avascular necrosis of the
proximal femoral epiphysis (eg, Legg-Calve-Perthes) can present with a limp, the pain is
typically more mild and develops gradually without fever.

(Choice E) Hematogenous osteomyelitis in adults occurs more commonly in the vertebral
bodies due to increasing vertebral vascularity with age as well as epiphyseal closure during
puberty (improves capillary flow within the metaphyses of long bones).
