In addition, AS can cause complications in extraskeletal systems:

1. Respiratory: Involvement of the thoracic spine and enthesopathies of the costovertebral
and costosternal junctions can limit chest wall expansion, leading to hypoventilation.
Chest expansion should be monitored regularly in patients with AS.

2. Cardiovascular: The most common cardiovascular complication of AS is ascending
aortitis, which can lead to dilation of the aortic ring and aortic insufficiency.

3. Eye: Anterior uveitis develops in some patients with AS and presents with pain, blurred
vision, photophobia, and conjunctival erythema.

(Choice B) Hand joint mobility testing is part of the assessment of rheumatoid arthritis
severity. However, the small joints of the hands are not prominently affected by AS.

(Choice C) Peak expiratory flow is determined by airway resistance (obstruction) and chest
and abdominal wall muscular function. These variables are not affected by chest wall
restriction and are normal in AS. Regular measurement of expiratory flow rates is important in

patients with asthma.

(Choice D) Rheumatoid factor can be found in a variety of rheumatic (eg, rheumatoid arthritis,
Sjégren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]) and nonrheumatic disorders (eg,
