Skeletal muscle fibers (or myocytes) are categorized into 2 major types based on the

magnitude and sustainability of contraction force they generate and their predominant method

of energy production.

Type | fibers (slow-twitch fibers) specialize in stamina (fatigue resistance) but can generate
only relatively low force per contraction. These fibers primarily use oxidative
phosphorylation (OP) to allow for sustained and efficient production of ATP. Therefore, they
have a high content of lipids (fatty acids are a primary energy source for OP), myoglobin (to
supply oxygen), and mitochondria (the cellular location of OP). The high myoglobin content
gives these fibers a red color.

Type Il fibers (fast-twitch fibers) primarily specialize in rapid bursts of strength; they generate
high force per contraction but quickly fatigue. These fibers produce ATP primarily via
anaerobic glycolysis and have high glycogen levels. Therefore, they have low quantities of
mitochondria and myoglobin (giving them a pale red or white color).

Targeted physical training stimulates specific phenotypic adaptations in skeletal muscle fibers
to improve skeletal muscle function. Endurance training (eg, distance running, sustained
light-to-moderate weightlifting) promotes the characteristics of type | fibers (eg, increased
size and quantity of mitochondria) and also increases capillary density. In contrast, resistance
