The proteases (eg, collagenase, metalloproteinase) contribute to cartilage destruction. In
addition, both cytokines indirectly activate osteoclasts, resulting in bony erosions. Monoclonal
antibodies that inhibit TNF-alpha (eg, adalimumab, etanercept) or IL-1 receptors (eg, anakinra)
are widely used in the treatment of RA and can slow progression of the disease.

(Choice B) Activated Th1 cells produce significant quantities of IL-2 and interferon gamma,
among other cytokines. Although Th1 cells and interferon gamma play a role in the
pathogenesis of RA, IL-2 is less prominent. These cytokines are present in higher quantities in
granulomatous diseases (eg, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis).

(Choice C) IL-4 and IL-5 are involved prominently in mast cell function and play a role in the
pathogenesis of atopic disorders (eg, asthma).

(Choice D) Transforming growth factor-beta and IL-10 are antiinflammatory cytokines that
downregulate lymphocyte activation and proliferation and reduce the production of
proinflammatory cytokines (eg, TNF-alpha). These cytokines are likely protective of the joint
destruction seen in RA.

(Choice E) IL-12 and IL-23 are produced by activated T cells and play a prominent role in the
pathogenesis of psoriasis.
