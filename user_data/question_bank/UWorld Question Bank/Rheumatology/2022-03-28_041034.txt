This patient has an injury to the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The MCL attaches
proximally to the medial epicondyle of the femur and resists forces that push the knee
medially. MCL injury typically occurs after a twisting injury or blow to the lateral knee while the
foot is planted (valgus stress injury).

The valgus stress test is performed with the knee extended by placing one hand along the
lateral thigh and pressing inward while the other hand is placed on the medial aspect of the
ankle and pushed outward. Laxity of the knee and/or medial joint line widening indicates MCL
injury.

(Choices A and E) The lateral (A) and medial (E) menisci reduce shock and help transfer
force from the upper to the lower leg. Medial meniscal injury can occur with twisting
movement of the knee and often accompanies MCL injury. Lateral meniscal injury is less
common. Meniscal injury is diagnosed by joint line tenderness while the knee is flexed.

(Choice B) The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) resists excessive lateral movement of the
knee. LCL injury is uncommon but would be characterized by laxity of the knee with varus
stress.

(Choice C) The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) resists anterior movement and medial
rotation of the tibia. Injury is indicated by increased anterior movement of the tibia in relation PCEVENO
