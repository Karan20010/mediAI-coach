A 17-year-old boy is referred to a clinic for ongoing muscle weakness. He has noticed difficulty
climbing stairs at home over the last several months, and he recently stopped playing
basketball due to difficulty lifting the ball over his head. The patient takes no medications and
does not know of any family members with muscle weakness. On neurologic examination, he
is unable to lift his arms or legs against resistance when fully outstretched. He undergoes a
muscle biopsy to evaluate the cause of his proximal muscle weakness. Electron microscopy
of the specimen reveals sparse transverse tubules in some of the muscle fibers. Which of the
following is the most likely consequence of this patient's biopsy findings?

A. Decremental force generation on repeated muscle stimulation (13%)

B. Impaired ATP production during active muscle contraction (8%)

C. Impaired relaxation after sustained muscle contraction (3%)

D. No contraction of the myocyte in response to increased intracellular Caz (21%)

YE. Uncoordinated contraction of myofibrils within affected muscle fibers (52%)
