This patient most likely has a psoas abscess. The psoas muscle arises from the transverse
processes and lateral aspects of the 12th thoracic through 5th lumbar vertebrae. It then
courses downward across the pelvic brim anterior to the hip joint capsule and deep to the
inguinal ligament to insert into the lesser trochanter of the femur via a tendon shared with the
iliacus muscle. The iliacus and psoas muscles act as the major hip flexors.

Psoas abscesses can occur due to direct spread of infection from an adjacent structure (eg,
vertebral bodies, appendix, hip joint) or from hematogenous or lymphatic seeding from a
distant and sometimes unknown site (in this case, the patient's skin infection). Risk factors
include diabetes mellitus, intravenous drug use, HIV infection, and other forms of
immunosuppression.

Signs and symptoms of a psoas abscess include fever, back or flank pain, inguinal mass, and
difficulty walking. Pain is exacerbated by movements that cause the psoas muscle to be
stretched or extended (which causes irritation of the muscle fibers), such as extension at the
hip (ie, psoas sign). As such, patients frequently position themselves to reduce discomfort by
minimizing psoas stretching, particularly with hip flexion, external rotation, and lumbar lordosis.

The psoas sign can also occur in acute appendicitis when the appendix is retrocecal (ie,

located behind the cecum), as the inflamed appendix lies upon the right psoas muscle
