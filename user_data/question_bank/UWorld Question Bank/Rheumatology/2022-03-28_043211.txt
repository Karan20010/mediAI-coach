This patient likely has Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), a common cause of knee pain in

adolescent athletes due to overuse of the quadriceps muscle group (ie, rectus femoris,

vastus intermedius, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis). The quadriceps is responsible for leg

extension at the knee and inserts into the tibial tubercle via the patellar ligament. The

tubercle forms as a secondary ossification center (apophysis) of the tibia, and the

cartilaginous nature of the developing tibial tuberosity in childhood makes it more prone to

injury compared to the fully ossified bone in adults.

OSD most commonly occurs after a growth spurt due to increased tension in tendons and
igaments caused by the rapidly elongating bone. Repetitive quadriceps contraction (eg,
sports activity) then results in chronic avulsion of the tibial tubercle. Clinical findings include
tenderness and swelling at the tibial tubercle and pain that worsens with knee extension (eg,
jumping). Imaging frequently shows an elevated and fragmented tibial tubercle.

(Choice A) The anterior intercondylar area (ie, fossa) is the space between the medial and
lateral condyles of the tibia. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) attaches at this specific

location and is crucial for knee stabilization. ACL injury typically results from sudden
deceleration with direction change and presents as acute knee pain, swelling, and instability
that prevents weight-bearing.
