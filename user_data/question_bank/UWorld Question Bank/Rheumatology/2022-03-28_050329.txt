Vitamin D is derived from food and generated in the skin due to sunlight exposure (ie,

conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol). Endogenous production from sunlight

accounts for approximately half of daily requirements (~200-400 |IU/day [required: 600]). The

dietary share is usually obtained primarily from fortified dairy/dairy-alternative foods; oily fish

(eg, salmon, herring) is also an abundant source. Other foods contain vitamin D but are often

insufficient to meet requirements.
