This patient's shoulder pain and weak, painful external rotation against resistance with
preserved abduction are characteristic of an infraspinatus injury. The rotator cuff muscles all
attach to the humeral head and stabilize the shoulder joint, in addition to moving the arm at the
shoulder. A fall onto the shoulder is a common mechanism for rotator cuff injury, resulting in
acute shoulder pain and characteristic weakness depending on which muscle is involved:

¢ The supraspinatus inserts onto the superior aspect of the greater tubercle and abducts the
arm (Choice D).

¢ The infraspinatus inserts onto the posterolateral aspect of the greater tubercle and
externally rotates the arm.

¢ The teres minor inserts onto the posterolateral aspect of the greater tubercle and helps

with adduction and external rotation of the arm.

¢ The subscapularis inserts onto the lesser tubercle on the anterior aspect of the humerus
and helps with adduction and internal rotation of the arm (Choice C).

(Choice A) The biceps brachii is a 2-headed muscle that originates from the scapula and
converges onto a single insertion point on the upper forearm. It is responsible for flexion at the

elbow and forearm supination. Biceps injury can cause shoulder pain but would not affect
