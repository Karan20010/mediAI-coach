Educational objective:

Paget disease of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation. It
commonly affects the skull, long bones, and vertebral column. The increased formation of new
bone is associated with an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level. Radiographs shows
lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions, thickening of cortical and trabecular bone, and bony

deformities.
