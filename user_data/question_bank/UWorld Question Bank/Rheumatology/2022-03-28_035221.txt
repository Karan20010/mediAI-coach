The pelvic bones and femoral trochanters provide sites of attachment for the large postural
and ambulatory muscles of the hip girdle. Fractures involving these attachment sites are
commonly caused by high-velocity trauma (eg, motor vehicle collisions, falls from height), but
may occur even with ground-level falls (eg, getting out of the shower) in patients with skeletal
fragility (eg, postmenopausal osteoporosis).

This patient's x-ray shows avulsion of the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur. The
greater trochanter serves as the site of insertion for the gluteus medius muscle, which
originates from the ilium. The main actions of the gluteus medius are hip abduction and
stabilization of the pelvis during ambulation. Damage to the point of insertion on the greater
trochanter can result in lateral hip pain with gait instability (ie, positive Trendelenburg sign) and
weakness of abduction.

(Choice A) The ischiocondylar portion of the adductor magnus originates from the ischial
tuberosity and inserts onto the medial condyle of the distal femur. Major functions include hip
adduction and extension.

(Choice C) The iliopsoas is the union of iliacus and psoas major and inserts onto the lesser
trochanter of the femur. It is the primary flexor of the hip.
