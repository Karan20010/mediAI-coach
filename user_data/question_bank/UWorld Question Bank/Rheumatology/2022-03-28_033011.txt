Educational objective:

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line therapy for treating acute gouty
arthritis. They inhibit cyclooxygenase and exert a broad anti-inflammatory effect that includes
inhibition of neutrophils. When NSAIDs are contraindicated (eg, peptic ulcer disease, renal
impairment), colchicine is useful in the acute management of gout as it inhibits neutrophil
chemotaxis and phagocytosis by preventing microtubule formation.
