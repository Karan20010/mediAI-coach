Question Id: 18996
This patient's systemic symptoms, renal/small-bowel infarctions, and biopsy findings are

consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a systemic vasculitis of medium-sized muscular
arteries. PAN is generally marked by the following:

¢ Segmental, transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with invasion of neutrophils and

monocytes

¢ Destruction of the inner portion of the arterial wall; the normal architecture is replaced with
necrotic fibrinoid material and loose connective tissue, which narrows the vessel
lumen and increases the risk of thrombosis and tissue infarction.

e Destruction of the internal and external elastic laminae, which increases the risk of
microaneurysms and subsequent rupture

Patients with PAN generally present with weeks or months of nonspecific constitutional
symptoms (eg, weight loss, fatigue, low-grade fever, arthralgias) and signs of tissue ischemia
in the kidneys (eg, renal infarction), gastrointestinal tract (eg, small-bowel infarction,
mesenteric ischemia), peripheral nerves, and/or skin. Because PAN is not associated with
antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies or significant elevation in antinuclear antibodies,
diagnostic confirmation usually requires tissue biopsy.
