(Choice D) Medullary thyroid cancer may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia
(MEN) type 2 (both A and B variants). MEN 2A is associated with pheochromocytoma and
hyperparathyroidism, whereas MEN 2B is associated with pheochromocytoma and mucosal

neuromas.

(Choice F) Thymic neoplasia or thymomas are commonly associated with myasthenia gravis
(MG), another autoimmune neuromuscular condition. MG is often confused with LEMS;
however, in MG facial, periocular, and bulbar weakness typically presents before extremity
weakness. In addition, the weakness worsens with exercise, deep tendon reflexes typically
remain intact, and autonomic dysfunction is rare.

Educational objective:

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by
autoantibodies against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels. It causes progressive
proximal muscle weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes that improve with exercise
(postexercise facilitation); cranial nerve involvement and autonomic symptoms may also
occur. LEMS is strongly associated with small cell lung cancer.
