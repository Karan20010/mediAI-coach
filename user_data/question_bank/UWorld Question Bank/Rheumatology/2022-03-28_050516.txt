active due to its large surface area. Initially following menopause, bone loss predominantly
affects trabecular bone, especially in the dorsolumbar vertebral bodies. Morphologic
characteristics include trabecular thinning and perforation with loss of interconnecting
bridges. With continued aging, cortical bone, which composes most of the appendicular
skeleton, also becomes involved. The neck of the femur has components of both trabecular
and cortical bone, and is a common site of osteoporotic fracture.

(Choice A) Paget disease of bone is caused by defective osteoid formation and increased
bone remodeling. Collagen is laid down in a haphazard manner, resulting in a mosaic pattern
of bone with irregular sections of lamellar bone linked by prominent cement lines. Paget
disease typically presents with bone pain and deformity with osteolytic or mixed lytic/sclerotic
lesions on x-ray.

(Choice B) Osteomalacia is commonly due to vitamin D deficiency, and is characterized by
unmineralized osteoid deposits on trabecular surfaces. The bone is weak and prone to
fracture, but symptomatic patients typically have bone pain, muscle weakness, and impaired
ambulation.

(Choice C) Osteopetrosis is a group of disorders characterized by impaired osteoclast
function. This leads to persistence of the primary spongiosa in the medullary cavity. These
