This patient has chronic, symmetric, inflammatory arthritis associated with significant

morning stiffness and overt synovitis (swelling, warmth, tenderness). In association with
the radiographic findings of joint space narrowing and marginal joint erosions, this presentation
is typical for rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RAis a progressive autoimmune disorder that has a
peak incidence at age 50-75 but can occur at any age; women are affected more often than
men. Systemic symptoms (eg, fatigue, fever) are common.

The pathogenesis of RA involves both humoral (eg, autoantibodies against citrullinated
polypeptides) and cell-mediated immunity; activation of CD4- T cells, especially Th1 and Th17,
occurs early in the disease process. Macrophages release proinflammatory cytokines critical

for the development and progressive articular destruction seen in RA. These include:

¢ Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulates the proliferation of inflammatory
cells and causes expression of inflammatory factors (eg, collagenase, prostaglandins) by
synovial cells.

e IL-1 induces synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases and enhances T-cell immune

responses.

The proteases (eg, collagenase, metalloproteinase) contribute to cartilage destruction. In

addition, both cytokines indirectly activate osteoclasts, resulting in bony erosions. Monoclonal
