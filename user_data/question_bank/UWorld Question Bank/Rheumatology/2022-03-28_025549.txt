Transverse tubules (T-tubules) are invaginations of the muscle cell membrane
(sarcolemma) located in close proximity to the terminal cisterns of the sarcoplasmic

reticulum. They are found in striated (eg, cardiac, skeletal) muscle and contain voltage-gated
L-type calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors) adjacent to the ryanodine receptors on the
terminal cisterns. During muscle contraction, T-tubules allow the depolarization impulse to
rapidly propagate through the interior of the muscle fiber. This ensures that calcium release
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum occurs uniformly throughout the fiber, allowing for
synchronized contraction of myofibrils in each muscle cell.

This patient most likely has a form of limb girdle muscular dystrophy due to a mutated
sarcolemma protein (eg, caveolin) affecting excitation-contraction coupling. Decreased
numbers of functional T-tubules in affected muscle fibers lead to uncoordinated contraction of
myofibrils, which manifests as muscle weakness.

(Choice A) Decremental force generated on repeated stimulation characterizes myasthenia
gravis, an autoantibody disorder inhibiting postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors in the
neuromuscular junction. A constant low response to repeated nerve stimulation is more likely
if T-tubules are lacking.

(Choice B) ATP fuels myosin movement along actin filaments (causing contraction) and
