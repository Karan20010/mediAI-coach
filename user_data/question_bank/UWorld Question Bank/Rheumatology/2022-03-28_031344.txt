(Choice D) Rheumatoid factors are autoantibodies targeting the Fc portion of human IgG that
occur in most patients with RA. Their diagnostic utility is limited by their poor specificity as
they are found in approximately 10% of healthy individuals, in 30% of patients with systemic
lupus erythematosus, and in nearly all patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia.

(Choice E) The presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is a nonspecific finding in many
connective tissue disorders. Antinuclear antibodies characteristically occur in IgM form in
patients with RA, but they are found less frequently than rheumatoid factors.

(Choice F) Antiphospholipid antibodies are found in patients with systemic lupus
erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome
causes hypercoagulability, paradoxical partial thromboplastin time (PTT) prolongation, and
recurrent miscarriages (spontaneous abortions).

Educational objective:

Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by symmetric polyarthritis (involving the
metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints) with prolonged morning stiffness
and associated fatigue. Antibodies to citrullinated peptides/proteins have a high specificity for
the condition.
