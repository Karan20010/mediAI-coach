12 (Choice C) Retrocalcaneal bursitis causes pain and swelling at the posterior heel near the

insertion of the Achilles tendon. It is usually caused by overuse and often occurs in
15 association with Achilles tendinopathy. However, it is significantly less common than enthesitis
as a cause of posterior heel pain in AS.

Educational objective:

20 Enthesitis (inflammation at the bony insertions of tendons, ligaments, and joint capsules) is a
prominent manifestation of spondyloarthritis (eg, ankylosing spondylitis). Common clinical

23 syndromes include Achilles tendinitis, plantar fasciitis, and dactylitis. Achilles tendinitis affects
the site of insertion of the Achilles tendon on the calcaneus and presents with severe pain at
26 the posterior aspect of the foot.
