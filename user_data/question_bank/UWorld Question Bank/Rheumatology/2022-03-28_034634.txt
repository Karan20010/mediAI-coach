(Choice A) The intervertebral disc is a shock-absorbing cartilaginous structure between the
vertebral bodies made of a tough cartilage ring (ie, anulus fibrosis) surrounding a soft
fibrocartilaginous core (ie, nucleus pulposus). Damage can lead to herniation of the disc or
loss of space between the vertebral bodies but would not cause anterior displacement of the
vertebral bodies.

(Choices C and D) The spinous process projects posteriorly in the midline and serves as an
attachment of muscles and ligaments. The paired transverse processes project
posterolaterally from the vertebral arch. In the thoracic vertebrae, facets on the transverse
processes articulate with the tubercles of the ribs. Fractures of the spinous process or
transverse processes are considered stable; they do not typically result in either neurologic
compromise or displacement of the vertebral bodies.

(Choice E) The vertebral body is the weight-bearing, anterior portion of the vertebrae.
Fractures to this area may cause avulsions or compression fractures that lead to a loss of
height but not typically to displacement.

Educational objective:
Fracture of the posterior vertebral arch often occurs at the pars interarticularis (ie,
spondylolysis). Bilateral disruption of the pars interarticularis can lead to anterior displacement ctivate V
