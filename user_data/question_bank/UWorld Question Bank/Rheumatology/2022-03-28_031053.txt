A 61-year-old woman who recently immigrated to the United States has a long history of "joint
problems." She began to have pain in her hands at age 30, and her symptoms have been
intermittent but progressive since then. The symptoms were treated with nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs when the pain was most severe. The patient also has a history of
hypertension and chronic anemia. She does not smoke cigarettes or use illicit drugs. Family
history is insignificant. On examination, there is gross deformity of multiple joints in both
hands. X-ray findings are shown in the image below.
