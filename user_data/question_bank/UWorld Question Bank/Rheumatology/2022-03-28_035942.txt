(Choices B and C) Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor in young adults;
however, the long bones are primarily affected, and imaging typically shows a lytic bone
lesion. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft-tissue sarcoma that usually arises in the head/neck,
genitourinary tract, or extremities; imaging usually reveals a soft-tissue mass. Neither is
typically associated with fever and a fluid collection; these features make an infectious process
far more likely.

(Choice D) Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause of spinal epidural abscess.
Although the radiographic appearance can be similar to Pott disease, most cases arise in the
setting of intravenous drug use, hematogenous spread of a distant infection (eg, endocarditis),
or direct inoculation during a spinal procedure. This patient's recent emigration from a
tuberculosis-endemic area makes Pott disease more likely.

Educational objective:

Mycobacterium tuberculosis spondylitis (Pott disease) is usually the result of hematogenous
seeding of vertebrae from primary pulmonary infection. Manifestations typically arise months
or years later (due to reactivation) and include chronic, progressive back pain, fever, and
radiographic evidence of vertebral bone destruction and fluid collection.
