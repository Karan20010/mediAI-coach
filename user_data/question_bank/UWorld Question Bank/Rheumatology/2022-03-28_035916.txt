This patient who recently emigrated from a tuberculosis-endemic region (Nepal) now has
progressive back pain, intermittent fever, and vertebral bone destruction with an adjacent fluid
collection (abscess), raising strong suspicion for Mycobacterium tuberculosis spondylitis
(Pott disease).

Primary tuberculosis infections are acquired via inhalation and cause localized pulmonary
infection that is typically contained over weeks by the cell-mediated immune response.
However, transient bacteremia can occur prior to containment and result in the
hematogenous seeding of highly vascular organs (eg, spleen, liver, bones); the vertebrae are
particularly likely to be affected due to their extensive venous plexuses.

Pott disease typically occurs months to years following primary pulmonary infection. It is
characterized by intermittent fever and slowly worsening pain in the lumbar or lower thoracic
spine. The infection frequently spreads behind the anterior ligament to the adjacent vertebrae
and intervertebral disc space, leading to contiguous bone destruction and abscess
formation.

(Choice A) Hodgkin lymphoma is often associated with intermittent fever but typically
presents with regional adenopathy and/or a mediastinal mass. Vertebrae destruction and a
fluid collection are not common features. ctivate V
