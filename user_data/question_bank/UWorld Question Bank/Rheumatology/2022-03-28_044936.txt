A 55-year-old man is admitted to the hospital due to abdominal discomfort and black stools.
Medical history includes asthma and hypertriglyceridemia, for which the patient takes the
appropriate medications. He has smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for 30 years and used
intravenous drugs in the past. The patient is treated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor;
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy does not reveal a source for the pain or bleeding.
Symptoms resolve without further intervention, and he is discharged. Several weeks later, the
patient returns to the emergency department with fever, weight loss, and muscle pain. After
initial evaluation, muscle biopsy demonstrates transmural inflammation of medium-sized
arteries with areas of amorphous, eosin-staining arterial wall necrosis. Areas of disruption of
the internal elastic lamina are also present. Which of the following is the most likely
predisposing factor for this patient's current condition?

©) A. Antibiotic use
© B. Asthma
©) C. Hypertriglyceridemia
