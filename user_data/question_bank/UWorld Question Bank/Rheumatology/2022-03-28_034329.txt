The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) are found
within the articular capsule of the knee joint and cross one another as they span from the
femur to the tibia. The PCL originates from the anterolateral surface of the medial femoral
condyle and inserts into the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia. At the level of the tibial
plateau (as seen on the axial MRI above), the ACL is anterior, and the PCL is posterior. The
ACL functions to resist anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur (Choice A).

The PCL prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur, and its integrity
can be tested by using the posterior drawer test (posterior force applied to the tibia while the
knee is flexed). PCL tears most commonly occur following a direct blow to the anterior
proximal tibia during sporting activities or motor vehicle collisions.

(Choices B and E) The medial and lateral menisci are crescent-shaped bands of
cartilaginous tissue that line the periphery of the knee joint. Meniscal tears are associated with
twisting of a flexed knee while the corresponding foot is planted. Meniscal damage can be
detected on physical examination by joint-line tenderness during provocative maneuvers (eg,
McMurray test).

(Choice C) The patellar ligament (ie, patellar tendon) connects the inferior portion of the
