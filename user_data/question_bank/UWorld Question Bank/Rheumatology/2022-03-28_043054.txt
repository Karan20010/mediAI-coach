This patient's clinical findings of intermittent diplopia, difficulty chewing, and speech problems
(especially at the end of the day) suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is
caused by impaired functioning of nicotinic cholinergic receptors at the neuromuscular junction
due to interference by IgG autoantibodies. The diagnosis can be confirmed with
administration of an anticholinesterase agent (eg, edrophonium), which increases the amount
of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Acetylcholinesterase activity decreases at
lower temperatures, so application of an ice pack can also improve symptoms caused by
weakness of superficial muscles (eg, ptosis).

MG is a form of type II hypersensitivity, which is characterized by IgM and/or IgG
autoantibodies that bind to cell surface antigens and/or extracellular matrix components.
Among the available options, only Goodpasture syndrome is due to the production of
autoantibodies (directed against the glomerular basement membrane). These antibodies
cause inflammatory destruction of the basement membrane in the lung alveoli and renal
glomeruli.

(Choice A) Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, pruritic, eezematous skin condition that almost

always begins in childhood. The pathogenicity involves several factors, including skin barrier
abnormalities, defects in innate immunity, and a T,.2-skewed immune response.
