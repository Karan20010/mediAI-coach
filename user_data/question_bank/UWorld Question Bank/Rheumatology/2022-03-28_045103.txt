(Choice E) Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome is an X-linked disorder characterized by the triad of
thrombocytopenia, immunodeficiency, and eczema. It is caused by a defect in cytoskeleton
rearrangement, not by CD18 deficiency.

Educational objective:

Leukocyte adhesion deficiency is due to the absence of CD18 antigens, which are necessary
for the formation of integrins. Failure of leukocyte adhesion and migration results in recurrent
skin and mucosal infections without purulence, delayed umbilical cord separation, and
peripheral leukocytosis.
