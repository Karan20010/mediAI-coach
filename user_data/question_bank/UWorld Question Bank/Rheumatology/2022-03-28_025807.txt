This patient is exhibiting classic Trendelenburg gait (ie, gluteus medius gait), which is
characterized by hip drop on the contralateral, unaffected side when that foot is raised. This
gait is observed when there is injury to the superior gluteal nerve or to the gluteus medius
muscle. The superior gluteal nerve is derived from the L4-S1 ventral rami and leaves the
pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the level of the piriformis. Injections into the
superomedial quadrant of the buttock have a high probability of injuring the superior gluteal

nerve.

(Choices A, B, and C) Due to its large size, the sciatic nerve is at risk of injury following an
injection in any quadrant of the buttock or the superior portion of the posterior thigh. However,
the sciatic nerve innervates the knee flexors (eg, hamstrings) and leg/foot muscles, and injury
to the nerve would cause weakness in knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion (eg, foot drop)
rather than Trendelenburg gait.

(Choice D) The superolateral quadrant of the buttocks is considered the safest place for
dorsogluteal injections. However, damage to the gluteal and sciatic nerves can still result from
injections into this region. Most intragluteal injections should target the anterolateral gluteal
area (ie, von Hochstetter triangle) to minimize the possibility of nerve damage.
