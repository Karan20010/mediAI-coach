(Choice C) Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis typically presents with edema and proteinuria
in adults and is characterized by localized regions of mesangial sclerosis and collapse on light
microscopy. This patient's age and purpura make this diagnosis unlikely.

(Choice E) Fusion or flattening of podocytes occurs in minimal change disease, the most
common form of nephrotic syndrome in children. Patients have proteinuria and edema, not
hematuria and rash.

(Choice F) Subepithelial immune complex deposition is characteristic of poststreptococcal
glomerulonephritis, which can present with hematuria weeks after group A Streptococcus
(GAS) pharyngitis or skin infection (eg, impetigo). Although a blanching, erythematous,
sandpaper rash can occur with GAS (ie, scarlet fever), palpable purpura is not seen.

Educational objective:

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an IgA-mediated small vessel vasculitis that manifests with
palpable purpura on the lower extremities, abdominal pain, arthralgia/arthritis, and renal
disease (hematuria + proteinuria). Renal involvement is due to IgA deposition in the
mesangium.
