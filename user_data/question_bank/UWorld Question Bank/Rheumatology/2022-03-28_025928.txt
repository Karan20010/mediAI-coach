(Choice B) Clavicular fracture only occasionally causes neurovascular compromise, usually
involving the subclavian vessels and supraclavicular nerve.

(Choice D) Thyroidectomy may cause injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Injury causes
weakness of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles, with hoarseness and impaired breathing.

(Choice E) Injury to the upper brachial plexus (musculocutaneous and suprascapular nerves)
can occur due to traction between the head and shoulder. This can occur in the neonate due
to dystocia or in the adult from violent injury. The resulting palsy is characterized by shoulder
adduction, elbow extension, and forearm pronation.

Educational objective:

Dissection of the axillary lymph nodes can injure the long thoracic nerve. This results in
weakness of the serratus anterior with winging of the scapula and impaired abduction of the
shoulder past the horizontal.
