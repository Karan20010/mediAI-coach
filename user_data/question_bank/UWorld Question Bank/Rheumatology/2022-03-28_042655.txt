(Choice C) Carpal tunnel syndrome is characterized by paresthesias and pain in the
distribution of the median (not radial) nerve. Sensory symptoms are more prominent than
motor symptoms during the initial presentation.

(Choice E) Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease. There
is no known association with p-ANCA, eosinophilia, or systemic vasculitis.

(Choice F) Pulmonary parenchymal involvement by systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) results
in a chronic restrictive interstitial fibrosis. Antitopoisomerase | (Scl-70), anticentromere, and
anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies are highly specific for systemic sclerosis.

Educational objective:

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss) is a small to medium vessel
vasculitis characterized by late-onset asthma, rhinosinusitis, and eosinophilia. Mononeuritis
multiplex due to involvement of the epineural vessels of peripheral nerves is common.
