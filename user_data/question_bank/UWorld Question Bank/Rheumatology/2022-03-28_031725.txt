migration and phagocytosis, reducing the inflammation seen in gouty arthritis. Because
colchicine also disrupts microtubule formation in gastrointestinal mucosal cells, many patients
develop diarrhea and, less commonly, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

(Choices A and E) Probenecid decreases proximal tubular uric acid reabsorption, and
allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase (converts xanthine to uric acid). These medications are
prescribed to lower serum uric acid levels in chronic gout. These agents are contraindicated in
acute gouty arthritis as they can mobilize tissue stores of uric acid and precipitate or worsen
acute attacks.

(Choice B) NSAIDs induce their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase
(COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes, thus blocking prostaglandin synthesis. Because they can
cause significant gastrointestinal irritation (eg, nausea, dyspepsia, bleeding), their use is
contraindicated in patients with peptic ulcer disease.

(Choice D) Glucocorticosteroids exert their anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting
phospholipase Ao activity. These medications can be used in acute gout and are not
associated with significant diarrhea.
