This patient has a chronic, symmetric, deforming arthritis consistent with advanced
rheumatoid arthritis (RA). His examination shows classic features including joint
enlargement, ulnar deviation at the metacarpophalangeal joints, and swan neck deformities
(hyperextension at the proximal interphalangeal joints with flexion at the distal interphalangeal
joints).

The joint destruction in RA is thought to be initiated by CD4+ T helper cells and is
characterized by synovial hyperplasia and an inflammatory infiltrates (often containing
lymphoid follicles). The joint space often becomes replaced by a synovial pannus, an
invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory
cells. Release of proteinases (eg, matrix metallopeptidase 13) causes destruction of the
articular cartilaginous matrix, facilitating erosion of the surrounding articular cartilage and
underlying bone. Ossification of the pannus can lead to fusion of the bones across the
affected joint (bony ankylosis).

(Choices A and E) Calcific degeneration of the articular cartilage (chondrocalcinosis) is a
characteristic feature of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease (pseudogout).
Deposition of uric acid crystals results in gout. Both gout and pseudogout are inflammatory
arthritides that can cause pain and joint deformation but present with acute, episodic arthritis
