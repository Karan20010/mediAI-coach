external rotation of the arm at the shoulder.

(Choice E) Unlike the teres minor, the teres major is not a rotator cuff muscle. It arises from
the inferior scapula and inserts below the humeral head onto the anterior aspect of the
humerus. It assists with humeral extension (when the arm is flexed) and internal rotation of
the arm at the shoulder.

(Choice F) The trapezius originates from the occipital bone and spinous processes of the
cervical and thoracic vertebrae and inserts onto the scapula and clavicle. It helps move and
rotate the scapula. Trapezius injury would cause difficulty with arm abduction and adduction,
but would not affect external rotation of the humerus.

Educational objective:

The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) all
insert onto the humeral head, allowing them to stabilize the shoulder joint and move the arm at
the shoulder. An infraspinatus injury would result in shoulder pain and weak, painful external
rotation of the arm against resistance.
