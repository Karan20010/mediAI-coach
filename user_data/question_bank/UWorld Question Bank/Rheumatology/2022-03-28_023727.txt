common primary malignant bone tumor in children (after osteosarcoma). It typically occurs in
the diaphysis of long bones (eg, femur) or in the pelvis and presents with localized pain and
swelling. It often metastasizes to the lungs, and pulmonary complications (eg, hemoptysis)
are a leading cause of death.

Imaging classically reveals a poorly defined, lytic, "moth-eaten" lesion that infiltrates the bony
cortex and neighboring soft tissue. The associated periosteal reaction leads to concentric
layers of new, reactive bone ("onion skin" appearance).

ES is a primitive tumor of unclear origin (likely arising from neuroectodermal or mesenchymal
stem cells). Histopathology reveals sheets of uniform, small, round, blue cells with scant,
clear cytoplasm separated by fibrous septa and patches of necrosis. Most cases are
associated with a translocation involving EWSR7 on chromosome 22 and FL/1 on
chromosome 11. This translocation produces a fusion protein that functions as an abnormal
transcription factor, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

(Choice A) Adenocarcinoma, the most common primary lung malignancy, often metastasizes
to bone. Histopathology shows neoplastic glands lined by mucin-producing cells.

(Choice B) Chondrosarcoma typically occurs in the axial skeleton (eg, pelvis) of older adults
(age >40). Histopathology shows neoplastic chondrocytes in a cartilaginous matrix.
