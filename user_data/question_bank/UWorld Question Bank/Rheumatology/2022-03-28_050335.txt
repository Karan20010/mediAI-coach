Vitamin D is derived from food and generated in the skin due to sunlight exposure (ie,
conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol). Endogenous production from sunlight
accounts for approximately half of daily requirements (~200-400 IU/day [required: 600]). The
dietary share is usually obtained primarily from fortified dairy/dairy-alternative foods; oily fish
(eg, salmon, herring) is also an abundant source. Other foods contain vitamin D but are often
insufficient to meet requirements.

Vitamin D deficiency reduces intestinal absorption of calcium. Parathyroid hormone
secretion increases to mobilize calcium from bone and maintain plasma calcium levels but
causes renal phosphate wasting. The resulting hypophosphatemia causes impaired
mineralization of bone. In children, this manifests as rickets, characterized by excessive
unmineralized osteoid matrix at the epiphyseal (growth plate) cartilage.

Clinical manifestations of rickets include frontal bossing, craniotabes (softened skull bones),
and costochondral widening from cartilage overgrowth (rachitic rosary). Dental enamel
hypoplasia can also be seen. Weight-bearing children may show lower extremity bowing
(genu varum). Radiographs of growth plates (eg, distal ulna) often reveal metaphyseal plate
widening and cupping.
