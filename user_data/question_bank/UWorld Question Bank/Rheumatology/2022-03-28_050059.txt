have up to 100 nuclei (normal osteoclasts have 2-5). The 2 most important factors for
osteoclastic differentiation, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor for
activated nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANK-L), are produced by osteoblasts and bone
marrow stromal cells.

Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a physiologic decoy receptor that decreases binding of RANK-L to
RANK. Inhibition of RANK-L to RANK receptor interaction reduces the differentiation and
survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone resorption and increased bone density
(Choice C). OPG loss-of-function mutations cause juvenile Paget's disease. A monoclonal
antibody (denosumab) that inhibits the RANK/RANK-L interaction also leads to increased bone

density and is commonly used for the treatment of osteoporosis.

(Choice A) Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) regulate chondrogenesis and osteogenesis.
FGFs induce proliferation of osteoblastic precursor cells and anabolic function of mature
osteoblasts. Abnormalities in the FGF receptor result in the congenital short-limbed dwarfism
known as achondroplasia.

(Choice B) Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II) are synthesized by various tissues,
including the liver and bone. IGF-I increases osteoblastic replication and collagen synthesis; it
also decreases collagen degradation by inhibiting the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-13
