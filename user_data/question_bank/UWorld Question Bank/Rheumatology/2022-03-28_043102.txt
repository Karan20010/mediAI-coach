(Choice B) The pathogenesis of contact dermatitis (type IV hypersensitivity reaction) involves
cutaneous exposure to small foreign molecules (haptens) that bind to skin proteins. These
proteins are subsequently processed by antigen-presenting Langerhans cells that transport the
modified proteins to lymph nodes and promote the development of hapten-specific T cells.
With continued hapten exposure, sensitized T cells produce inflammatory cytokines at the
exposure site, causing the characteristic eczematous skin changes.

(Choice D) Most patients with acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis have specific serum IgG
antibodies that precipitate bacterial or fungal antigens found in inhaled organic dust particles.
This causes interstitial alveolitis and bronchiolitis via immune complex and complement
deposition in vessel walls (type III hypersensitivity mechanism).

(Choice E) The pathogenesis of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis involves granular
deposition of immune complexes containing group A streptococcal antigens, IgG, and C3 in
the glomerular basement membrane and mesangium. It is a type Ill, immune complex-
mediated, hypersensitivity response.

Educational objective:
Myasthenia gravis results from an autoimmune type II (antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity
reaction against skeletal myocyte surface acetylcholine receptors. Goodpasture syndrome
