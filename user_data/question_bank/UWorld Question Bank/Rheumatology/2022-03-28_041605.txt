(Choices D and E) Vitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D into
inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites; it functions to degrade excess levels of vitamin D.

Although it is expressed predominantly in the kidneys and may be impaired in chronic kidney
disease, loss of this enzyme would lead to higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels and so would
reduce, rather than worsen, the patient's symptoms.

Educational objective:

In chronic kidney disease, conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is
impaired. In addition, failure of glomerular and tubular function results in phosphate retention
and hypocalcemia. This leads to a compensatory rise in parathyroid hormone (secondary
hyperparathyroidism) that can present with weakness, muscle and joint pain, defective bone
mineralization, and increased fracture risk.
