(Choice A) The ischiocondylar portion of the adductor magnus originates from the ischial
tuberosity and inserts onto the medial condyle of the distal femur. Major functions include hip
adduction and extension.

(Choice C) The iliopsoas is the union of iliacus and psoas major and inserts onto the lesser
trochanter of the femur. It is the primary flexor of the hip.

(Choice D) The rectus femoris originates from the anterior inferior iliac spine, joins the other
portions of the quadriceps femoris (ie, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and vastus
intermedius) in a common quadriceps tendon, and attaches to the lower leg via the patella and
patellar tendon. Because of its origin on the ilium, the rectus femoris contributes to hip flexion
in addition to knee extension.

(Choice E) The sartorius originates from the anterior superior iliac spine and crosses the
anterior thigh to insert with the pes anserinus (common tendon for the sartorius, gracilis, and
semitendinosous muscles) onto the superomedial surface of the tibia. It aids in hip flexion,
abduction, and external rotation.

Educational objective:
The greater trochanter of the femur serves as the site of insertion for the gluteus medius
