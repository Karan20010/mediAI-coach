This patient's limb shortening with normal torso length, specific craniofacial features (frontal
bossing, midface hypoplasia), and risk of passing the condition to her offspring (50%) are
characteristic of achondroplasia. The condition is caused by an autosomal dominant point
mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene; 90% are de novo (unaffected
parents) and 10% are inherited. Because the mutation is autosomal dominant, the fetus of
an affected and an unaffected parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation.

Achondroplasia affects endochondral ossification, the process that makes long bones (eg,
humerus, femur, phalanges) and portions of the skull and face. In endochondral bone
formation, mesenchymal cells differentiate into chondrocytes that secrete cartilage matrix.
These chondrocytes continue to proliferate through childhood, forming an elongating cartilage
template that progressively becomes calcified and later invaded by osteoblasts, osteoclasts,

and blood vessels originating from the periosteum. Deposition of osteoid matrix over the septa

of calcified cartilage matrix forms woven bone, which then undergoes remodeling into compact
bone.

FGFR3 is normally responsible for limiting chondrocyte proliferation during endochondral
ossification. In achondroplasia, FGFR3 becomes constitutively activated, causing

exaggerated inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation that results in the characteristic bone
