Cyclooxygenase (COX; prostaglandin synthase) initiates the synthesis of prostanoids (eg,
prostaglandins, thromboxane) from arachidonic acid. COX exists in 2 primary forms:

¢ COX 1, which plays a physiologic role in a number of normally functioning tissues (eg,
platelets, gastrointestinal tract)
¢ COX 2, which is preferentially expressed at sites of inflammation.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) work by inhibiting COX to block
prostaglandin synthesis. Most NSAIDs inhibit both the COX 1 and COX 2 isoenzymes.
However, inhibition of COX 1 may lead to severe adverse effects, including gastric ulceration
(reduced mucosal protection) and increased bleeding (decreased platelet aggregation).
Selective COX 2 inhibitors (eg, celecoxib) have potent anti-inflammatory effects with less
risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal ulceration. They are recommended for use in patients at
risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as those with prior peptic ulcer disease. The risk
for ulcers can also be reduced by combining a nonselective NSAID with a second drug (eg,
proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol) to reduce gastric acid secretion.

(Choice A) Selective COX 2 inhibitors do not have a substantial effect on serum lipids.

(Choices B and D) Both COX 1 and COX 2 are expressed in renal tissues. Therapy with
