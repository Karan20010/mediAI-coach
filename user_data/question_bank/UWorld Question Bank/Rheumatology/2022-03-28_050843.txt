Educational objective:

Patients with osteoporosis have low bone mass, resulting in increased susceptibility to fragility
fractures (ie, those occurring with minimal or no trauma). In primary osteoporosis (not caused
by a medical disorder), serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels are

typically normal.
