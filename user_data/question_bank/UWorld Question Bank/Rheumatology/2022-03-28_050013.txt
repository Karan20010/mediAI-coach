Thiazide diuretics (eg, hydrochlorothiazide, chlorthalidone) are indicated for treatment of
patients with hypertension, including those who also have diabetes mellitus. Although
thiazides can cause a small increase in blood glucose, this effect is often not clinically
significant and substantially outweighed by their blood pressure-lowering benefits.

Thiazides inhibit the Na-Cl cotransporter in the distal convoluted tubule, leading to decreased
sodium reabsorption. Thiazides also cause peripheral vasodilation, resulting in reduced
peripheral vascular resistance. In addition, thiazide diuretics increase calcium reabsorption
in the distal tubule. Studies have shown that use of thiazides is associated with higher bone
mineral density and reduced fracture risk, and many experts recommend them for treatment of
hypertension in patients who are at risk for osteoporosis. Increased calcium reabsorption also
causes hypocalciuria, which may prevent recurrent renal stones in some patients.

(Choice A) Several antiepileptic drugs (eg, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital) are
associated with decreased bone mineral density and increased risk of osteoporosis.

(Choice B) Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker that is indicated for treatment of
hypertension. It is also used for rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation. It has no
significant effect on serum calcium levels, bone density, or fracture risk.
