(Choice B) Copper deficiency typically presents with muscle weakness, anemia, and fragile
(kinky) hair. Skin hypopigmentation is also common, but rash does not occur.

(Choice C) Riluzole is a glutamate inhibitor that is indicated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects both upper and lower motor nerves.
Although proximal muscle weakness may be seen (lower motor neuron dysfunction), upper
motor neuron signs (eg, bulbar dysfunction, hyperreflexia) are expected and the disease is not
associated with skin rash.

(Choice E) Hypothyroid myopathy commonly presents with proximal muscle weakness.
However, unlike polymyositis and dermatomyositis, patients usually also have prominent
muscle pain and often have other hypothyroid features (eg, weight gain, cold intolerance).

Educational objective:

Dermatomyositis is characterized by proximal muscle weakness (similar to polymyositis) and
dermal manifestations (eg, heliotrope rash, Gottron papules). Laboratory testing shows
elevated muscle enzymes (eg, creatine kinase) and autoantibodies (eg, antinuclear, anti-Jo-
1). Initial treatment includes systemic glucocorticoids and evaluation for potential underlying
malignancy.
