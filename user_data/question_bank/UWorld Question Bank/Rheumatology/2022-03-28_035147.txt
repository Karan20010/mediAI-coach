aponeurosis of the forearm.

(Choice C) The levator scapulae originates on the C1-C4 vertebrae and spans to the
superomedial scapula. This muscle raises the scapula and rotates the acromion inferiorly.

(Choice D) The pectoralis minor spans from the coracoid process of the scapula to the third,
fourth, and fifth ribs and stabilizes the scapula against the thoracic wall.

(Choice E) The teres minor spans from the lateral scapula to the greater tubercle of the
humerus. It stabilizes the glenohumeral joint and laterally rotates the humerus.

Educational objective:

The clavicle is commonly fractured in children after a fall on an outstretched arm. In a distal
clavicle fracture, the deltoid muscle and the weight of the arm cause inferolateral displacement
of the distal fragment, whereas the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles cause
superomedial displacement of the proximal fragment.
