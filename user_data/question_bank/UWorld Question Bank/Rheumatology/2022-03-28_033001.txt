thromboxanes), exerting a broad anti-inflammatory effect that includes inhibition of
neutrophils. Patients with contraindications to NSAIDs (eg, peptic ulcer disease, renal
impairment) are often treated with colchicine, which impairs neutrophil migration and
phagocytosis by interfering with microtubule formation. Colchicine also decreases tyrosine
phosphorylation in response to monosodium urate crystals, resulting in decreased neutrophil
activation.

(Choice A) Eosinophils function in defense against parasitic infections and are also
pathogenic in patients with asthma, allergy, hypereosinophilic syndromes, and vasculitides
such as Churg-Strauss syndrome.

(Choice B) Lymphocytes produce delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions that do not play a
role in gout.

(Choice D) Synovial cells and macrophages play a role in initiating the inflammatory response
in gouty arthritis. However, targeting these cells would not eliminate the inflammatory
amplification caused by neutrophils, which is the central mechanism involved in precipitating
an acute gouty attack.

(Choice E) Mast cell degranulation can be inhibited by medications such as cromolyn sodium,

which is used in conditions such as asthma and allergic rhinitis. Activate Windows
