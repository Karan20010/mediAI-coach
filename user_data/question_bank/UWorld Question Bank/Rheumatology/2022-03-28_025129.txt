The latissimus dorsi is a large thoracolumbar muscle that contributes to forceful movement of
the humerus. It originates in a broad area spanning from the iliac crest and lumbar fascia to
the spinous processes of T7-12 and lower ribs. It inserts at the bicipital groove of the
humerus. The latissimus dorsi is innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve, with fibers
originating from the C6-8 nerve roots. Primary functions include extension, adduction, and
internal rotation of the humerus.

Due to its broad area and exposed location, the latissimus dorsi is vulnerable to injury from
external trauma. It is also frequently injured in sports requiring forceful downward movement
of the humerus, such as throwing, climbing, or swinging a tennis racket overhead.

(Choice A) The deltoid is innervated by the axillary nerve, and its primary action is abduction
of the arm. It can be injured due to sudden or forceful loading of the arm while in abduction.

(Choice B) The infraspinatus is innervated by the suprascapular nerve and serves to
externally rotate the arm. It is most commonly injured in association with the supraspinatus
due to falls or overuse in older patients.

(Choice D) The trapezius is a large muscle in the upper back and neck that serves to elevate,
rotate, and stabilize the scapula. It is primarily innervated by cranial nerve XI. The trapezius is

frequently injured in rear-end (whiplash) motor vehicle accidents.
