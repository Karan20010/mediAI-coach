Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant used in the prevention of organ transplant rejection
and the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel
disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. It functions via inhibition of purine synthesis pathways.
Following ingestion, azathioprine is converted to 6-mercaptopurine, which is then converted to
6-thioguanine metabolites; these metabolites are pharmacologically active and mediate both
the therapeutic and adverse effects of azathioprine.

The 6-thioguanine metabolites reduce cellular proliferation via 2 methods of purine synthesis
inhibition:
¢ The metabolites inhibit phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) amidotransferase, an
enzyme that catalyzes an early step in de novo purine synthesis.

¢ The metabolites act as false nucleotides, incorporating into actively replicating DNA and
RNA and rendering the growing nucleic acid strand nonfunctional.

These effects are exerted preferentially on rapidly dividing cells (eg, activated lymphocytes in
the setting of organ transplant or autoimmune disease) but are otherwise nonspecific and
disrupt other hematologic cell lines, including neutrophils, erythrocytes, and platelets.

Therefore, pancytopenia (ie, leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia) is a common
