(Choice C) Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with weak antirheumatic activity. Common
side effects include photosensitivity dermatitis.

(Choice D) Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [eg, naproxen]) are used for initial
symptom relief in RA, although they do not prevent the long-term joint damage caused by the
disease. Significant side effects include gastritis/gastric ulcers and acute kidney injury.

(Choice E) Glucocorticoids are used for initial treatment and acute flares of RA. Short-term
side effects include insomnia and hyperglycemia. Long-term side effects are significant and
include weight gain, osteoporosis, and muscle weakness; these drugs also potentiate the risk
of gastric ulcers in patients taking NSAIDs.

Educational objective:

Methotrexate is the preferred disease-modifying treatment for patients with moderate to severe
rheumatoid arthritis. Significant adverse effects include stomatitis, bone marrow suppression,
and liver function abnormalities.
