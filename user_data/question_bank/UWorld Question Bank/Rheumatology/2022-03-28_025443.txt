The rotator cuff muscles originate from the scapula and insert onto the proximal humerus; they
stabilize the shoulder joint and move the arm at the shoulder. Overuse (eg, heavy lifting) can
lead to rotator cuff injury, resulting in shoulder pain and possible weakness; the specific
symptoms depend on which muscle is involved.

Resistance added by the examiner when testing muscle function increases tendon loading,
eliciting pain when tendon pathology is present. This patient has pain on resisted external
rotation, suggesting pathology of the infraspinatus or teres minor, the two rotator cuff
muscles responsible for this function.

The infraspinatus is the main external rotator when the arm is adducted (eg, by the side),
whereas teres minor is the main external rotator when the arm is abducted. When the
infraspinatus tendon is torn, there is often compensatory hypertrophy of the teres minor,
thereby preserving the strength of external rotation.

(Choice A) Latissimus dorsi is a broad muscle in the mid- and low back. It originates from the
spinous processes of T7 to LS, iliac crest, thoracolumbar fascia, inferior angle of the scapula,
and the lower 3 or 4 ribs. It inserts onto the bicipital groove of the humerus and adducts,
extends, and internally (not externally) rotates the arm.
