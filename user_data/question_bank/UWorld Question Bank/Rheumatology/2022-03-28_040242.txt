hydroxycholecalciferol. The conversion to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol by 1-alpha-
hydroxylase in the kidney is primarily regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and plasma
calcium levels. Neither of these steps takes place in the skin or is affected by sunlight
exposure.

(Choices D and E) 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D into inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites. It is upregulated by 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D (to prevent excess vitamin D activity) and suppressed by parathyroid
hormone (to facilitate replenishment of circulating calcium levels) and thus functions as a
counter-regulatory homeostatic enzyme. However, it is not affected by sunlight.

Educational objective:

Sunlight exposure catalyzes conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to cholecalciferol (vitamin D3)
in the skin. Subsequent 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1-hydroxylation in the kidneys
produce 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form. Inadequate exposure to sunlight can lead
to vitamin D deficiency.
