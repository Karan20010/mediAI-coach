: A 15-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to hemoptysis. He has a
6 history of amputation of the right lower extremity due to bone cancer. Chest imaging reveals a
z lung mass. Excisional biopsy of the mass shows sheets of uniform, round, small cells slightly
9 larger than lymphocytes with scant, clear cytoplasm. The cellular deposits are interrupted by
vascular fibrous septa, with areas of hemorrhage and an abrupt transition from viable to

12 necrotic cells. A representative sample is shown in the image below.
