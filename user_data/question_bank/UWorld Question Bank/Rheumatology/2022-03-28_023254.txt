popliteal fossa together with the popliteal vein and artery. It then traverses the posterior
compartment of the leg deep to the soleus muscle. After providing motor innervation to the
posterior compartment muscles, the nerve enters the plantar aspect of the foot through the
tarsal tunnel (between the flexor retinaculum and medial surfaces of the talus and calcaneus).
Here, it divides into the medial and lateral plantar nerves, providing sensory innervation over
the sole of the foot and motor innervation to the intrinsic foot muscles.

Injury to the nerve at the popliteal fossa (eg, deep penetrating trauma, knee surgery) can
cause weakness on foot plantarflexion because the nerve innervates the gastrocnemius,
soleus, and plantaris muscles. Weakness may also be evident on foot inversion (eg, tibialis
posterior muscle) and toe flexion (eg, flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus
muscles). Consequently, patients often present with the foot held in a calcaneovalgus position
(eg, dorsiflexed and everted). In contrast, injury to the tibial nerve at the tarsal tunnel may
cause sensory loss over the sole with intrinsic foot muscle weakness. However, plantarflexion
and inversion remain intact as fibers innervating these muscles branch off more proximally.

(Choice A) The cutaneous branches of the femoral nerve innervate most of the skin over the
anterior thigh.

(Choice B) The superficial peroneal nerve innervates the lateral leg and dorsum of the foot,
