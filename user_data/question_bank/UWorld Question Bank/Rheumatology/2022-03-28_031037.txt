The diagnosis is established by synovial fluid analysis, which shows increased white blood
cells. Monosodium urate crystals are seen under polarized light microscopy and may be
present both intra- and extracellularly. They are characteristically needle-shaped and
negatively birefringent (when the crystals are aligned parallel to the slow ray of the
compensator, they appear yellow; when aligned perpendicular, they appear blue).

(Choice A) Osteoarthritis causes chronic, progressive arthritis in the distal hands and weight-
bearing joints. Synovial fluid analysis shows normal to minimal inflammatory findings.

(Choices B and C) Gonococcal arthritis presents with fever, skin lesions, and inflammatory
mono- or oligoarthritis. Staphylococcal septic arthritis causes a fulminant monoarthritis,
usually with fever. Recurrent episodes are more characteristic of gout.

(Choice D) Rheumatoid arthritis causes a chronic polyarthritis, typically involving the
metacarpophalangeal joints of the hands. Synovial fluid will show a sterile inflammatory
effusion.

(Choice F) Nontraumatic hemarthrosis is most commonly seen in patients taking
anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) or with bleeding disorders (eg, hemophilia).
