extension of a flexed elbow while contracting the biceps (eg, lifting a heavy object).

(Choice E) The ulnar nerve runs posterior to the medial epicondyle and can be injured with
hyperflexion injuries (eg, falling onto a flexed elbow), resulting in posterior displacement of the
proximal humerus or fracture of the medial epicondyle. Ulnar nerve injury at the elbow often
presents with sensory loss over the fifth digit and half of the fourth digit, as well as weakness
on flexion of the wrist and fourth/fifth digits.

Educational objective:

Supracondylar humeral fractures commonly occur after hyperextension of the elbow as a
result of a fall onto an outstretched arm. The radial nerve runs along the anterolateral aspect
of the elbow and is the structure most likely to be injured with anterolateral displacement of the
proximal fracture fragment. The brachial artery runs with the median nerve on the
anteromedial aspect of the elbow and will usually be spared in these patients (eg, intact radial
pulse).
