(compact bone) that makes up the shafts of long bones and outer envelopes of all bones
becomes more involved, leading to an increased risk of hip fracture.

In primary osteoporosis (ie, osteoporosis that is not due to an underlying medical disorder),
serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are typically in the normal

range.

(Choice A) High serum PTH with low serum calcium (area A in the diagram) is usually seen in
patients with renal failure or vitamin D deficiency.

(Choices B and E) High calcium, high PTH (area B) is consistent with primary
hyperparathyroidism. High calcium levels with low PTH (area E) would be seen in patients
with PTH-independent hypercalcemia (PTH is appropriately suppressed by high calcium
levels), which can occur with humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy and vitamin D toxicity.

(Choice D) In patients with hypoparathyroidism, low PTH levels cause hypocalcemia.

Educational objective:

Patients with osteoporosis have low bone mass, resulting in increased susceptibility to fragility
fractures (ie, those occurring with minimal or no trauma). In primary osteoporosis (not caused
by a medical disorder), serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone levels are
