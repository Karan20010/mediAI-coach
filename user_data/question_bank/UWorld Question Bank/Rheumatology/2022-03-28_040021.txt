(Choice A) The ACL is injured more commonly than the PCL. It spans from the anterior

portion of the intercondylar tibia to the posterior medial side of the lateral femoral condyle. It
prevents anterior displacement of the tibia relative to the femur when the knee is flexed

(anterior drawer test).

(Choice B) The patellar ligament spans from the patella to the tibial tuberosity and is the
continuation of the quadriceps femoris tendon.

(Choice D) The tibial (medial) collateral ligament is a very strong band of tissue that spans
from the medial femoral epicondyle to the medial condyle of the tibia. It also attaches to the
medial meniscus.

(Choice E) The transverse genicular ligament attaches the medial and lateral menisci
anteriorly on the proximal articular surface of the tibia.

Educational objective:

The posterior cruciate ligament prevents posterior displacement of the tibia relative to the
femur when the knee is flexed. It attaches to the posterior part of the intercondylar area of the
tibia and the anterior part of the lateral surface of the medial epicondyle of the femur.
