Question Id: 1897
This patient has symptoms consistent with long-standing Lyme disease. Lyme disease is
caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes
tick. Lyme disease is endemic in the northeastern United States and northern Europe. Like
syphilis, another spirochetal infection, Lyme disease progresses through a predictable series

of phases:

1. Early localized phase: Days to weeks following exposure, patients experience flu-like
symptoms and the characteristic cutaneous eruption, erythema chronicum migrans (ECM).

2. Early disseminated phase: Weeks or months later, there may be central nervous system
(eg, facial palsy) and/or cardiac involvement (eg, atrioventricular nodal block).

3. Late Lyme disease: This phase, which occurs months to years post-exposure, is rare given
the frequency with which patients receive antibiotics for other indications. Patients may
experience asymmetric arthritis (most often involving a single knee joint, as in this
patient) and/or subacute encephalopathy with decreased memory, somnolence, and
mood changes.

Lyme disease is easily treated with doxycycline or penicillin-type antibiotics (eg, ceftriaxone).
This patient does not appear to have noted ECM, for which he would likely have received
doxycycline. However, treatment with ceftriaxone when he developed the facial palsy (a
