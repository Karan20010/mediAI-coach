(Choice B) Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone tumor characterized by focal bone dysplasia
with spindle cells. It typically presents as asymptomatic lytic lesions, most commonly in the
femur and tibia. Fibrous dysplasia is usually seen in children and is not an inflammatory
condition (ie, normal ESR).

(Choice C) Paget disease of bone is characterized by excessive and disordered bone
formation, with focal thickening of trabecular and cortical bone. Features include bone pain,
fractures, and arthritis of adjacent joints. However, it is uncommon at age <50, and this
patient's inflammatory back pain is more consistent with AS.

(Choice D) Intervertebral disc protrusion and thickening of the ligamentum flava can lead to
spinal stenosis. The pain in this disorder typically radiates to the posterior thighs and legs and
is relieved by sitting and flexion of the spine, not activity. Spinal stenosis is usually seen at
age >60 and ESR is normal.

(Choice E) Multiple myeloma is characterized by plasmacytic infiltrates in the bone marrow.
Patients often have back pain at night and during rest, but stiffness is less prominent. Multiple
myeloma is uncommon before age 50.
