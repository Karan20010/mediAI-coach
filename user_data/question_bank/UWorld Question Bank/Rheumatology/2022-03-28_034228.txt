This patient who experienced a high-energy fall onto an outstretched hand now has a volar
lunate dislocation, with the displaced lunate now palpable in the patient's proximal palm and
visualized on lateral x-ray of the wrist ("spilled teacup" sign).

Lunate dislocation requires a high-energy force to disrupt the numerous ligaments (eg,
scapholunate, capitolunate, lunotriquetral) that typically stabilize the lunate. When severe
ligamentous injury occurs, the lunate can dislocate volarly from its normal position within the
floor of the carpal tunnel and compress and/or injure the median nerve.

Median nerve injury at the level of the carpal tunnel may result in both sensory and motor
deficits in the distribution of the median nerve's distal branches:

e Palmar digital branches: numbness, pain, and/or paresthesia in the palmar surface of the
first 3’ digits; weakness of the first and second lumbrical muscles (interphalangeal joint
extension)

¢ Recurrent branch of the median nerve to the thenar muscles: weakness of the abductor
pollicis brevis (thumb abduction), flexor pollicis brevis (thumb flexion), and opponens
pollicis (thumb opposition)

Prompt reduction of the dislocated lunate is required to prevent permanent damage to the
