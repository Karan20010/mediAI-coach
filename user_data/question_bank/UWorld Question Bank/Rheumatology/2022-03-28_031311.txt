Clinical features of rheumatoid arthritis

e Pain, swelling & morning stiffness in multiple joints

¢ Small joints (PIP, MCP, MTP); spares DIP joints

Clinical presentation ¢ Systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, anemia)

¢ Cervical spine involvement: subluxation, cord
compression

¢ Positive rheumatoid factor & anti-CCP antibodies

¢ C-reactive protein & ESR correlate with disease

Laboratory/imaging studies activity

e X-ray: soft tissue swelling, joint space narrowing,
bony erosions

Anti-CCP = anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide; DIP = distal interphalangeal; ESR = erythrocyte
sedimentation rate; MCP = metacarpophalangeal; MTP = metatarsophalangeal; PIP = proximal

interphalangeal.

morning stiffness and associated fatigue is highly suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Activate Window
