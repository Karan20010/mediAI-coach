Question Id: 19911

(Choice C) Linear deposits of calcium hydroxyapatite in the periarticular structures cause a
painful inflammatory condition called calcific peritendinitis. However, it usually affects the
rotator cuff; hand and wrist involvement is uncommon and would present with

associated inflammatory changes (eg, redness, swelling, warmth).

(Choice D) Mucinous, gelatinous fluid filling of the tendon sheath is characteristic of a
ganglion cyst. Unlike fibrotic nodules in DC, ganglion cysts present as large, mobile, rubbery
nodules that do not lead to contractures of the hand.

(Choice E) Neutrophilic infiltration of tendon sheaths is characteristic of bacterial
tenosynovitis. Because it is an inflammatory condition, it presents with significant redness,
warmth, and swelling, none of which are present in DC.

Educational objective:

Dupuytren contracture is caused by progressive fibrosis of the superficial palmar fascia due to
excessive fibroblast proliferation. Pathognomonic fibrotic nodules and cords form along the
flexor tendons, limiting extension of the affected digits.
