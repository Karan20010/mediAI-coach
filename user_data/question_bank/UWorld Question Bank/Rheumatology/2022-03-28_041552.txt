Synthesis of vitamin D begins in the skin with the conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to
cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) by ultraviolet light. Cholecalciferol is subsequently converted to
25-hydroxyvitamin D (the primary body store of vitamin D) by 25-hydroxylase in the liver.
Finally, 25-hydroxyvitamin D is filtered by renal glomeruli (with vitamin D-binding protein) and
delivered to proximal tubule cells, where 1-alpha-hydroxylase converts it to 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D, the physiologically active form. The activity of 1-alpha-hydroxylase is
upregulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inhibited by fibroblast growth factor 23
(FGF23), a peptide secreted by osteocytes in response to high levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin
D.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) results in impaired conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D due to the following factors:

¢ FGF23 levels increase early in CKD, causing direct inhibition of 1-alpha-hydroxylase

e Reduced glomerular filtration limits the delivery of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to proximal tubule
cells

e Reduced functional renal mass limits production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase

Inadequate production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D causes reduced intestinal absorption of
