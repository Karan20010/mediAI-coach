(Choice C) The flat bones (eg, most of the skull, pelvis) grow primarily via intramembranous
(not endochondral) ossification. In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells
differentiate directly into osteoblasts and begin osteoid matrix secretion without the formation
of cartilaginous bones. As a result, most flat bones remain unaffected in achondroplasia.

(Choice D) Osteoclasts are specialized macrophages that function to resorb bone. Paget
disease, characterized by disordered bone mass, initially begins with excessive activity of
abnormally large osteoclasts followed by osteoblastic activity and eventual sclerosis. Patients
are usually elderly and can present with focal bone pain and pathologic fractures.

Educational objective:

Unlike the process of intramembranous ossification that forms flat bones, endochondral
ossification proceeds along a cartilage template and is responsible for the formation of long
bones. Achondroplasia is characterized by an exaggerated inhibition of chondrocyte
proliferation in the growth plates of long bones and manifests with proximal limb shortening,
midface hypoplasia, and macrocephaly.
