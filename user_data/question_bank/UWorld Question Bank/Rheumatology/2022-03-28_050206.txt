kidneys. AST is commonly used as a marker for hepatic injury and is also elevated in
rhabdomyolysis and myocardial infarction.
(Choice C) Calcitonin is secreted by the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid and inhibits bone
resorption by osteoclasts. As a laboratory marker, calcitonin is primarily used in the diagnosis

of medullary thyroid cancer; it does not mark osteoblastic activity.

(Choice D) Acid phosphatase is a family of lysosomal enzymes present in a wide variety of
cells, including osteoclasts (the acid phosphatase in osteoclasts is resistant to degradation by
tartrate). However, osteoblasts do not express acid phosphatase.

(Choices E and F) Osteoclastic activity (ie, bone resorption) leads to breakdown of fibrillar
collagen with release of biomarkers such as hydroxyproline and collagen telopeptides.
Increased urine levels are associated with states of increased bone resorption (rather than
formation).

Educational objective:

Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels correlate with osteoblast activity. Other markers of
osteoblast activity include N-terminal propeptide of type 1 procollagen, which is released
during post-translation cleavage of type 1 procollagen.
