injured the right upper extremity after falling off her bicycle 6 months ago. She has since had a

worried as these symptoms are interfering with her piano lessons and she has an upcoming
recital in 3 weeks. Physical examination shows decreased sensation over the fifth digit and a
flattened hypothenar eminence. Triceps reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. The nerve
affected in this patient is commonly injured at which of the following locations?
