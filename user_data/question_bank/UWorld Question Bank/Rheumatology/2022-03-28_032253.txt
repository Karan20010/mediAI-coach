consistent with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RAis a progressive autoimmune disorder
that is often associated with signs of systemic inflammation (eg, fatigue, fever, anemia). It has
a peak incidence at age 50-75 but can occur at any age; women are affected more commonly
than men.

The pathogenesis of RA begins with activation of T lymphocytes in response to rheumatoid
antigens (eg, citrullinated peptides, type II collagen). Activated T cells release cytokines that
cause synovial hyperplasia with recruitment of additional mononuclear cells. The
accelerated metabolic rate of the inflamed synovial tissue leads to local hypoxia and
increased production of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor by
local macrophages and fibroblasts, resulting in synovial angiogenesis (neovascularization).

As the disease progresses, new blood vessels provide nutrients that facilitate expansion of
inflammed synovium into a rheumatoid pannus, an invasive mass composed of fibroblast-like
synovial cells, granulation tissue, and inflammatory cells. Over time, the pannus encroaches
into the joint space and can destroy the articular cartilage and erode the underlying
subchondral bone (Choice C). Ossification of the pannus can lead to fusion of the bones
across the affected joint (bony ankylosis).
