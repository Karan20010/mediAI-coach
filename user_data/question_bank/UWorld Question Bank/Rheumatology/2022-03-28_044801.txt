(Choice D) Polyarteritis nodosa is an uncommon systemic vasculitis that presents with
intermittent episodes of abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, renal insufficiency, and severe
hypertension. Biopsy is characterized by transmural inflammation of the arterial wall with
fibrinoid necrosis.

(Choice E) Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) causes myalgias of the shoulder and pelvic girdle
muscles, often with systemic symptoms (eg, fever, weight loss). Weakness is not typical, and
PMR occurs almost exclusively in patients age >50.

Educational objective:

Polymyositis causes symmetric proximal muscle weakness. Muscle biopsy reveals
inflammation, necrosis, and regeneration of muscle fibers. Over-expression of major
histocompatibility complex class | proteins on the sarcolemma leads to infiltration with CD8- T

lymphocytes and myocyte damage.
