(Choices D and E) Damage to one of the terminal branches of the brachial plexus would
result in a pattern of deficits restricted to the sensory and/or motor function of one nerve. The
radial nerve can be injured by compression against the humerus (eg, Saturday night palsy) or
by a humerus fracture, causing weakness in wrist extension (eg, wrist drop). Injury to the
median nerve most commonly occurs at the wrist (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome) with resulting
numbness, tingling, and pain in the palm and first 3 digits.

Educational objective:

Motor and sensory deficits across multiple peripheral upper extremity nerves (eg, radial and
median) indicate a lesion in the brachial plexus proximal to the formation of the terminal
branches. In the absence of history of trauma or malignancy, the most likely cause is nerve
root compression due to cervical spondylosis (cervical radiculopathy).
