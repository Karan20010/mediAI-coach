This patient's mechanism of injury (eg, sudden pulling up on the arm) and presentation (eg,
holding the arm flexed and pronated, pain with movement) are consistent with radial head
subluxation (ie, nursemaid's elbow).

The radial head is anchored to the ulna by the annular ligament, which encircles the proximal
radius. In children age <5, this tissue is relatively thin compared to older children and adults.
Sudden axial traction (eg, pulling up on the arm by the hand) or twisting can cause the
annular ligament to slip over the radial head and become entrapped in the radiohumeral joint.

Patients classically hold the affected arm close to the body with the elbow flexed and the
forearm pronated. There is significant pain with movement or manipulation of the joint but
typically no obvious swelling or deformity. Reduction can usually be accomplished either by
hyperpronation of the forearm or supination of the forearm with flexion of the elbow.
(Choice B) Adistal biceps tendon rupture characteristically occurs in older patients after
forceful extension of the elbow while the biceps muscle is contracted, resulting in a visible
mass in the mid-upper arm (ie, "Popeye" deformity).

(Choice C) The interosseous membrane is a broad sheet of connective tissue between the
radius and ulna that provides forearm stability and a point of attachment for the forearm
