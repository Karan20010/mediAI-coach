(Choice A) The adductor brevis originates from the inferior pubic ramus and inserts onto the
linea aspera of the femur. Strain typically produces groin and medial thigh pain that can be
reproduced by resisted hip adduction (not abduction).

(Choices C and D) The obturator externus originates from the obturator membrane and
obturator foramen and inserts onto the trochanteric fossa of the femur. The quadratus femoris
originates from the ischial tuberosity and inserts onto the intertrochanteric crest of the femur.
These muscles externally rotate the hip (regardless of whether the hip is flexed, unlike gluteus
medius), and muscle strain would cause pain on resisted external (not internal) rotation.

(Choice E) Vastus lateralis is part of the quadriceps femoris complex. It originates from the
intertrochanteric line, greater trochanter, gluteal tuberosity, and linea aspera of the femur and
inserts onto the tibial tubercle via the quadriceps tendon/patellar ligament. Strain presents
with thigh pain that is reproduced by resisted knee extension.

Educational objective:

Greater trochanteric pain syndrome is an overuse tendinopathy of the gluteus medius and
gluteus minimus at their insertion on the greater trochanter of the femur. Examination shows
tenderness over the greater trochanter; pain is reproduced by resisted hip abduction and
internal rotation (when the hip is flexed).
