FGFR3 is normally responsible for limiting chondrocyte proliferation during endochondral
ossification. In achondroplasia, FGFR3 becomes constitutively activated, causing
exaggerated inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation that results in the characteristic bone

shortening and craniofacial abnormalities.

(Choices B and E) Hypothalamic neurosecretory cells produce growth hormone-releasing
hormone and anterior pituitary somatotrophs produce growth hormone (GH). Hypothalamic or
pituitary insults (eg, tumor, ischemia) can result in defective release of either hormone. GH
deficiency can lead to proportional short stature (both long and flat bones affected) as opposed
to the disproportionate short stature seen in achondroplasia (only long bones affected).

(Choice C) The flat bones (eg, most of the skull, pelvis) grow primarily via intramembranous
(not endochondral) ossification. In intramembranous ossification, mesenchymal cells
differentiate directly into osteoblasts and begin osteoid matrix secretion without the formation
of cartilaginous bones. As a result, most flat bones remain unaffected in achondroplasia.

(Choice D) Osteoclasts are specialized macrophages that function to resorb bone. Paget
disease, characterized by disordered bone mass, initially begins with excessive activity of
abnormally large osteoclasts followed by osteoblastic activity and eventual sclerosis. Patients
