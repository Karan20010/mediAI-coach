(Choice B) The medial collateral ligament (MCL) protects against valgus stress on the knee
and excessive external tibial rotation. MCL injury occurs after a lateral blow to the knee or
indirect stress from excessive lower leg rotation or abduction. Patients have excessive joint
widening on valgus stress (eg, the femur is held in a fixed position while an abducting [lateral]

force is applied to the lower leg/foot).

(Choice C) The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) controls anterior knee movement and
prevents excessive tibial rotation. ACL injury often occurs due to sudden acceleration or
deceleration in noncontact athletic injuries. Patients have laxity of forward movement of the
tibia against a fixed femur (anterior drawer test).

(Choice E) Knee flexors include the hamstring muscles (biceps femoris, semitendinosus,
semimembranosus), gracilis, gastrocnemius, and sartorius. Hamstring injury can decrease hip
extension and knee flexion. However, these muscles do not involve the patella.

Educational objective:

Patella fractures are most commonly due to a direct impact to the anterior aspect of the knee.
Signs include an acutely swollen knee, focal patella tenderness, inability to extend the knee
against gravity, and a palpable gap in the extensor mechanism.
