risk of bleeding and gastrointestinal ulceration. They are recommended for use in patients at
risk for gastrointestinal complications, such as those with prior peptic ulcer disease. The risk
for ulcers can also be reduced by combining a nonselective NSAID with a second drug (eg,
proton pump inhibitors, misoprostol) to reduce gastric acid secretion.

(Choice A) Selective COX 2 inhibitors do not have a substantial effect on serum lipids.

(Choices B and D) Both COX 1 and COX 2 are expressed in renal tissues. Therapy with
either nonselective NSAIDs or selective COX 2 inhibitors can cause fluid retention,
aggravation of hypertension, and impaired renal function.

(Choice E) COX 2 is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle
cells, where it plays a role in the local production of prostacyclin, which has anticoagulant and
vasodilatory actions. COX 2 inhibitors have been associated with an increased risk of
cardiovascular events.

Educational objective:
Selective cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) inhibitors relieve pain with lower risk of bleeding and
gastric ulceration than nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
