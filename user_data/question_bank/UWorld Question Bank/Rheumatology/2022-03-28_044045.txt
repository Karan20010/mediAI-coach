polymyalgia rheumatica, which causes achy pain in the shoulder and hip girdles. Headache
is the most common presentation of GCA, but jaw or tongue claudication is also common.
Ocular manifestations may include amaurosis, diplopia, blurred vision, and ischemic optic
neuropathy; untreated GCA may lead to permanent blindness.

Physical findings in GCA may be normal, but patients often have tenderness over the course
of the temporal artery. If GCA is suspected, a C-reactive protein (CRP) level or erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR) should be determined promptly. Although CRP and ESR are
nonspecific, they are highly sensitive and almost always significantly elevated in GCA.
Patients with characteristic symptoms and elevated CRP or ESR should undergo temporal
artery biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

(Choice A) Angiography in GCA may show focal areas of arterial narrowing, but it is not as
sensitive as ESR and CRP for initial assessment.

(Choice B) GCA is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events, including
transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, and myocardial infarction. Appropriate management of
other cardiovascular risk factors (eg, hyperlipidemia) is recommended but should not delay
initial evaluation.

Choice D) Noncontrast head CT is recommended for initial evaluation of patients with TIA
