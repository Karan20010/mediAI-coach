Scaphoid fractures are the most common carpal bone fracture and frequently result from a fall
on an outstretched hand that causes direct axial compression or hyperextension of the wrist.
Ascaphoid fracture should be suspected in any patient with persistent wrist pain and
tenderness in the anatomic snuffbox—a shallow, triangular depression at the dorsoradial wrist
defined by the following borders:

e Medial: tendon of the extensor pollicis longus

¢ Lateral: tendons of the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis
¢ Proximal: styloid process of the radius

¢ Floor: scaphoid and trapezium bones

The main blood supply to the scaphoid is provided by the dorsal scaphoid branch of the radial
artery; this branch enters near the bone's distal pole and then proceeds in a retrograde
manner to provide blood supply to the proximal pole. Because fracture of the scaphoid can
easily interrupt this retrograde flow, the fractured scaphoid is at risk for avascular necrosis of
the proximal pole and fracture nonunion.
