Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the sacroiliac joints and axial
skeleton. It is most common in young and middle-aged men and presents with morning
stiffness and low back pain. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by destruction of articular
cartilage with resulting stiffness and fusion of axial joints. The sacroiliac joints are often
tender to palpation, and the spine may have decreased range of motion. X-ray of the

12 sacroiliac joints may reveal erosions, sclerosis, and narrowing; ultimately fusion of the joint
spaces. Spine x-rays reveal sclerosis, ligamentous calcification, and vertebral fusion

is ("bamboo spine").

17 Ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease,

+ 20 of serum rheumatoid factor. Patients with these diseases have a higher incidence of the
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B27 allele, which encodes a specific HLA class | molecule,
23 compared to the general population (although most patients with HLA B27 will not develop
spondyloarthropathies).
