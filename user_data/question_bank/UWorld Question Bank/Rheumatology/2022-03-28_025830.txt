A 53-year-old man comes to the office with a dull ache in his right shoulder. The pain is worse
with movement and often interferes with his sleep. The patient cannot recall any traumatic
events prior to the start of the pain but did experience increased discomfort after helping his
daughter move into her college dorm room a week ago. His past medical history includes
dyslipidemia and hypertension, for which he takes the appropriate medications. Physical
examination reveals localized tenderness just below the acromion. The physician asks the
patient to abduct his arms 90 degrees to the side and flex them 30 degrees forward with his
thumbs pointing to the floor. She then applies downward force to his arms. This maneuver
elicits pain in the patient's right shoulder and reveals right-sided weakness as compared to the
left side. A tendon of which of the following muscles is most likely injured in this patient?

A. Biceps brachii (5%)

B. Deltoid (17%)

C. Levator scapulae (3%)
D. Serratus anterior (2%)

Y__ E. Supraspinatus (69%)
