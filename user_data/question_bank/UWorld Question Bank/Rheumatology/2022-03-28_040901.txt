This patient has a comminuted patella fracture. The patella is a large sesamoid bone that
facilitates knee extension, protects the joint from direct injury, and improves nourishment of the
distal femur articular cartilage. The quadriceps tendon inserts at the superior pole of the
patella and wraps distally around the patella to become the patellar tendon, which inserts at
the tibial tuberosity.

Patella fractures are most commonly due to a direct blow to the anterior aspect of the knee
(eg, landing on a flexed knee in a fall, striking the knee against the dashboard in a frontal
motor vehicle collision). The patella can also be fractured indirectly due to excessive force
transmitted through the quadriceps tendon (eg, landing on the feet after falling from a height).
Patients develop acute swelling (often with an associated effusion), focal tenderness, inability
to extend the knee against gravity, and a palpable gap in the extensor mechanism.

(Choice A) The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) protects against excessive posterior knee
movement and is the least frequently injured knee ligament. PCL injury results in a positive
posterior drawer test (increased backward movement of the tibia against a fixed femur).

(Choice B) The medial collateral ligament (MCL) protects against valgus stress on the knee
and excessive external tibial rotation. MCL injury occurs after a lateral blow to the knee or

indirect stress from excessive lower leg rotation or abduction. Patients have excessive joint
