This patient has paralysis of the serratus anterior muscle due to long thoracic nerve injury.

The serratus anterior originates on the surface of the first 8 ribs and inserts on the medial

border of the scapula. It functions to stabilize and rotate the scapula upward. The deltoid

and supraspinatus muscles abduct the arm up to the horizontal position, after which the

serratus anterior and trapezius are required to rotate the glenoid cavity superiorly, thereby

allowing complete abduction of the arm over the head.

Innervation of the serratus anterior is from the long thoracic nerve, which arises from the C5-
C7 nerve roots via the brachial plexus and follows a lengthy course along the lateral chest
wall. Injury to the nerve can occur during penetrating trauma or iatrogenically during axillary
lymph node dissection or chest tube insertion. Paralysis of the serratus anterior causes
scapular winging due to inability of the serratus to hold the scapula against the thorax.
Patients will also show weakness in abducting the arm above horizontal due to impaired
rotation of the scapula.

(Choice A) Anterior dislocation of the shoulder or fracture of the neck of the humerus can
injure the axillary nerve. This causes paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor muscles and
localized sensory loss in the upper arm.

(Choice B) Clavicular fracture only occasionally causes neurovascular compromise, usually
