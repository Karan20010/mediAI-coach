Supracondylar humeral fractures are common pediatric elbow fractures that
characteristically occur after hyperextension injuries (eg, falling onto an outstretched arm).
These fractures carry a significant risk of neurovascular compromise, especially if the
fragments are displaced. The brachial artery, median nerve, and radial nerve all run anterior to
the elbow, with the brachial artery and median nerve over the medial epicondyle and the radial
nerve over the lateral epicondyle.

The median nerve and brachial artery are frequently injured in supracondylar fractures due to
anteromedial displacement of the proximal fracture fragment (Choice C). However, this
patient has intact radial pulses bilaterally (ie, sparing of the brachial artery) and anterolateral
displacement of the proximal fracture fragment, making radial nerve injury more likely. Injury
to the radial nerve at the elbow can result in wrist drop due to denervation of hand/finger
extensor muscles, and sensory loss over the posterior forearm/dorsolateral hand.

(Choice A) The basilic vein runs superficially over the medial aspect of the elbow and is not
commonly injured during supracondylar fractures.

(Choice B) The 2 heads of the biceps muscle originate from the scapula and insert onto the
radius. Biceps tendon injury/rupture typically occurs in older patients following sudden
extension of a flexed elbow while contracting the biceps (eg, lifting a heavy object).
