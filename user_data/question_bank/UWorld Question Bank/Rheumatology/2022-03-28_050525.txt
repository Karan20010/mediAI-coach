marathon runner but has been unable to train due to a vertebral stress fracture diagnosed via
x-ray during a recent emergency department visit. She has a history of hypothyroidism for
which she takes levothyroxine. The patient's last menstrual period was a year ago. Her diet
consists mainly of vegetables and fruit, and she takes a daily multivitamin. Her mother died of
breast cancer at age 52. The patient is concerned that her family history puts her at risk for
breast cancer. X-ray absorptiometry studies demonstrate abnormally low bone density in the
lumbar vertebrae. Which of the following drugs is the most appropriate option for decreasing
