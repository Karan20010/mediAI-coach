(Choice B) The deltoid originates on the clavicle, the acromion, and the spine of the scapula;
it inserts on the lateral humerus. Deltoid injuries are less common than supraspinatus injuries
and usually manifest as sudden-onset shoulder pain after overloading the arm while in
abduction.

(Choice C) The tendons of the levator scapulae insert on the superomedial border of the
scapula and on the transverse processes of the C1 through C4 vertebrae. The levator
scapulae does not contribute to the stability of the glenohumeral joint.

(Choice D) The serratus anterior originates on the lateral surfaces of the first 8 ribs and
inserts on the scapula. Its primary action is to pull the scapula forward and rotate it to raise the
glenoid. Injury to the long thoracic nerve causes paralysis of this muscle and "winging" of the
scapula.

Educational objective:

The supraspinatus muscle assists in abduction of the arm and stabilization of the
glenohumeral joint. The supraspinatus tendon is vulnerable to injury due to impingement
between the acromion and the head of the humerus. Supraspinatus tendinopathy is the most
common cause of rotator cuff syndrome.
