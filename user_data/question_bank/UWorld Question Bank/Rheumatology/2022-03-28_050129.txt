-2.5) for peak young adult bone density.
The subjects in group A show a higher peak bone mass, slightly lower rate of post-peak bone
loss, and higher late-life bone mass than the subjects in group B. This is consistent with the
effects of regular exercise, especially weight-bearing exercise. In contrast, factors that lead to

a lower peak bone mass include genetic and ethnic factors (eg, Asian or Caucasian ethnicity),
chronic inflammatory disease, exposure to glucocorticoid medications, and sedentary lifestyle.
In addition, prolonged caloric deficits (often seen with excessive exercise) can lead to
functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, suppression of estrogen production, and rapid bone loss.

(Choice A) Estrogens have an anabolic effect on bone by increasing osteoblastic activity and
decreasing osteoclastic activity. Loss of estrogen effect (eg, menopause, premature ovarian
failure) causes accelerated bone loss.

(Choice C) Bone density is proportional to BMI. BMI <22 kg/m: (or weight <57.6 kg [127 Ib])

is associated with increased risk for osteoporosis.

(Choice D) Smoking causes accelerated bone loss and is a major risk factor for osteoporosis
and osteoporotic fractures.

(Choice E) Chronic glucocorticoid use is a major risk factor for osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids
