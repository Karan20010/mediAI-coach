microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
(Choice C) B cell-activating factor (BAFF) is a cytokine belonging to the tumor necrosis factor

ligand family. Inadequate levels of BAFF will lead to immunodeficiency, whereas excess levels
can cause autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus).

(Choice E) Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes capable of degrading various extracellular
matrix proteins and processing a number of bioactive molecules. They may be involved in
cytokine inactivation but do not play a direct role in the pathogenesis of GCA.

Educational objective:

Cell-mediated immunity is the primary mechanism underlying giant cell arteritis. The
production of cytokines, in particular interleukin-6, is an important driver of this process and
closely correlates with the severity of symptoms.
