This patient has acute monoarticular arthritis with an effusion, decreased range of motion of
the affected joint, and a synovial fluid leukocyte count >100,000/mm:. Septic arthritis (very
often due to gonococcus in this patient's age group) is a likely diagnosis, and he should
receive antibiotics given the risk of joint destruction, osteomyelitis, and sepsis. Synovial fluid
Gram stain and culture can help confirm the diagnosis (although cultures can sometimes be
negative with gonococcus). Microscopy can exclude the presence of crystals suggestive of
gout and pseudogout, conditions that can also cause acute monoarticular arthritis (gout is
associated with alcohol use). However, they typically present at an older age, and the synovial
fluid leukocyte count is usually lower (at the lower end of the 20,000-100,000/mm: range).

(Choice A) Allopurinol is a hypoxanthine isomer that lowers serum uric acid levels. It is
prescribed to prevent attacks of acute gouty arthritis but is not useful in the treatment of acute
flares.

(Choices C, D, and E) Colchicine reduces the acute inflammation of gouty arthritis by
inhibiting neutrophil migration into the inflamed areas. Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID), may be prescribed for pain relief in noninfectious inflammatory
