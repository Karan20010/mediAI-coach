e Reduced functional renal mass limits production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase

Inadequate production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D causes reduced intestinal absorption of
calcium. This, along with increased phosphate retention (due to impaired glomerular and
tubular function), leads to a compensatory increase in parathyroid hormone secretion
(secondary hyperparathyroidism). Chronically increased PTH levels have a deleterious
effect on bone metabolism (renal osteodystrophy), and can cause weakness, bone and
muscle pain, defective bone mineralization, and an increased risk of fractures.

(Choice A) The initial step in vitamin D synthesis is driven by ultraviolet exposure in the skin.
Factors that can lead to vitamin D deficiency include inadequate sunlight exposure (eg,
institutionalized elders, living at extreme latitudes), use of high-grade sunblock, nocturnal
occupations, and heavily pigmented skin.

(Choice B) 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency due to inadequate 25-hydroxylase activity can be

seen in patients with liver disease, but is uncommon and primarily seen in those with
advanced cirrhosis.

(Choices D and E) Vitamin D-24-hydroxylase converts 25- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D into
inactive 24-hydroxylated metabolites; it functions to degrade excess levels of vitamin D.
