Question Id: 18475
(Choice B) Antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) are indicated for patients with
amaurosis fugax (eg, transient vision loss) due to carotid atherosclerosis. However, this
patient's unilateral headaches and proximal muscle pain makes GCA a more likely diagnosis.

(Choice C) Ganciclovir is used to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis, which presents with blurred
vision, floaters, and photopsia (sensation of flashing lights). It occurs primarily in patients with
significant immune suppression (eg, advanced AIDS).

(Choice E) Sumatriptan is used for the treatment of migraine, which can cause a variety of
ocular symptoms. However, new-onset migraines are uncommon in older individuals, and this
patient's other symptoms are more consistent with GCA and PMR.

Educational objective:

Ocular manifestations in giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis) can lead to rapid, severe, and
irreversible vision loss. Involvement of the ciliary arteries in GCA leads to anterior ischemic
optic neuropathy, which presents with a painless, rapidly progressive decrease in visual
acuity. Treatment includes systemic glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone, methylprednisolone).
