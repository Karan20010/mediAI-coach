(myosin) (actin) ©uWorld
The H band is the region of the sarcomere containing only thick (myosin) filaments. On
electron microscopy, the H band is a portion of the A band that straddles the M line. TheA
band corresponds to the thick filaments in the sarcomere and includes portions overlapped by
thin (actin) filaments (Choice B). During muscle contraction, the thin filaments slide over the
thick filaments toward the M line, reducing the length of the H band. The A band always
remains the same length.

(Choice A) The Z line is typically distinctly darker than the remainder of the sarcomere. Thin
filaments, which are composed of actin, tropomyosin, and troponin, anchor at the Z line.
(Choice C) The segment of the sarcomere between the H and | bands is where thick and thin
filaments overlap.

(Choice D) The | band contains the Z line and only those sections of the thin filaments that do

not overlap with thick filaments. During muscle contraction, both the | band and H band
decrease in length.

Educational objective:
The H band is the region of the sarcomere that contains only thick (myosin) filaments. The H

band is the part of the A band (which is on either side of the M line) where thick filaments have
