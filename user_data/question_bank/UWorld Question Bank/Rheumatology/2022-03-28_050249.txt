Question Id: 987
This elderly patient's bone pain, increased alkaline phosphatase, and biopsy findings are
characteristic of Paget disease of bone (PDB), a condition that results in accelerated bone
remodeling with eventual bony overgrowth. The disease is thought to be caused by
environmental factors and gene mutations (eg, affecting RANK, osteoprotegerin) that result in
excessive RANK and NF-KB activation. This leads to increased osteoclast differentiation and
activity. The disease typically progresses through 3 phases:

1. Osteolytic (osteoclast-dominant) phase — characterized by increased numbers of

osteoclasts that appear abnormally large with an excessive number of nuclei. Increased
resorption activity is prominent.

2. Mixed (osteoclastic-osteoblastic) phase — defined by a rapid increase in osteoblastic bone
formation with persistent osteoclastic activity. The newly made bone is abnormal, with
interspersed areas of disorganized lamellar and woven bone.

3. Osteosclerotic (osteoblast-dominant) phase — characterized by continued osteoblastic
bone formation and remodelling that result in a dense, hypovascular, mosaic pattern of
lamellar bone with irregular, haphazardly oriented sections separated by prominent

cement lines.
