This patient has chronic hip pain that is worse with weight bearing and decreased range of
motion in multiple axes. X-ray reveals flattening and patchy sclerosis of the femoral head
consistent with osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis). Biopsy is not generally required for
diagnosis, but microscopic analysis of the affected bone may show dead bony trabeculae
(empty lacunae) and fat necrosis.

Osteonecrosis occurs due to disruption of the macrovasculature or microvasculature of
bone. The femoral head is the most common location, although other bones may be affected.
Conditions associated with osteonecrosis include the following:

¢ Sickle cell disease can cause thrombotic occlusion of arteries.

e Embolic disorders (eg, fat emboli, decompression sickness) can directly occlude small
arteries.

¢ High-dose systemic corticosteroids and excessive alcohol intake can cause fat embolism
and adipocyte hypertrophy in the marrow.

e Vasculitis (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) can injure the vessel wall, resulting in distal
ischemia.

e Femoral neck fracture can disrupt the medial circumflex femoral artery, which is the main
