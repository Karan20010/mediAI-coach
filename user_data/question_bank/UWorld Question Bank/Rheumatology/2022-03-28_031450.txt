antigen B27.

This patient presenting with chronic back and buttock pain associated with stiffness has
ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The symptoms are characteristically worse in the morning and
improve with stretching and warm showers. AS is most common in men age <40, and
inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) are usually elevated.

AS is characterized by simultaneous erosion of bone and new bone formation, unlike
rheumatoid arthritis in which only erosions are seen. The initial pathogenesis is driven in part
by inflammatory cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, IL-17), which cause activation of
osteoclast precursor cells and bony erosions. This occurs primarily in the vertebral bodies
and results in destruction of the microarchitecture, increasing the risk for secondary
osteoporosis and compression fractures.

Once the inflammation subsides, the reparative process leads to excessive new bone
formation (especially in areas where fat metaplasia fills previously eroded sites); in contrast to
erosion, bone formation occurs primarily at the periosteum-cartilage junction and manifests as
bridging syndesmophytes in the vertebral column. This leads to spinal rigidity, postural
alterations, and increased risk of fracture.
