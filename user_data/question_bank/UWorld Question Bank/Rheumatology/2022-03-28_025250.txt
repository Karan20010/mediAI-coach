This patient's CT scan reveals a large fluid collection in the right retroperitoneum anterior to
the psoas muscle. The fluid is isodense compared with muscle and displaces the right kidney.
These findings are consistent with a spontaneous retroperitoneal hematoma, which occurs
most often in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy (eg, warfarin). Affected patients often
present with acute, severe pain in the groin, lower abdomen, or back; injury to the femoral
nerve can also occur due to its proximity.

The femoral nerve descends through the psoas major muscle, emerges laterally between the
psoas and iliacus muscle, and then runs beneath the inguinal ligament into the thigh. Femoral
nerve mononeuropathy can occur due to trauma (eg, pelvic fracture), compression from a
hematoma or abscess, or injury during surgery/childbirth. Findings of femoral neuropathy
include quadriceps weakness (eq, difficulty with stairs, falling due to knee buckling),
decreased patellar reflex, and sensory loss over the anterior and medial thigh and medial
leg.

(Choice A) Obturator nerve injury presents with weakness of thigh adduction and medial thigh
sensory loss. It is most commonly seen as an iatrogenic complication of pelvic surgery.

(Choice C) Peroneal nerve injury often presents with loss of dorsal foot sensation and foot

drop due to weakness of foot eversion, dorsiflexion, and toe extension. It is typically caused
