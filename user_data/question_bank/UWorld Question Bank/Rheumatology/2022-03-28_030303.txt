Tropomyosin prevents cross Released Ca” binds to troponin
linking between actin and and removes the tropomyosin; this
myosin allows myosin cross-bridge-ADP-
phosphate complex to bind to
actin

ADP-phosphate complex is
released after the myosin
crossbridge binds to actin

new ATP is required for detachment

of the myosin crossbridge from actin
[Without this ATP, muscle will be
fixed in a contracted state (rigor
mortis))
