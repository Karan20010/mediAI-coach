Question Id: 15696

This older patient with multifocal bone pain has enlarged vertebral bodies with cortical
thickening on imaging, which is consistent with Paget disease of bone (PD). PD is
characterized by excessive and disordered bone formation. It commonly affects the skull,
long bones of the extremities, and vertebral column. In addition to pain and deformity,
vertebral involvement can lead to spinal stenosis, nerve compression, and compression

fracture.

The increased formation of new bone in PD is associated with an elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase level, but because the changes occur slowly, serum calcium and phosphorus
levels are often normal. Radiographs typically reveal lytic or mixed lytic-sclerotic lesions,
thickening of cortical and trabecular bone, and bony deformities. In the vertebrae, bony
enlargement and cortical thickening may create an appearance resembling a picture frame.
(Choice A) The level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D reflects total body vitamin D stores and is useful
in the diagnosis of osteomalacia. In addition to bone pain, osteomalacia causes muscle
weakness and difficulty walking. X-ray reveals diffuse demineralization, often with insufficiency
fractures, rather than cortical thickening.

(Choice C) The erythrocyte sedimentation rate reflects circulating levels of inflammatory

proteins and is elevated in many inflammatory and malignant conditions. It is classically
