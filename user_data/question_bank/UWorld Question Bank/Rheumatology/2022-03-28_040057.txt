Malignancies with a propensity for bony metastasis include Prostate, Breast, Kidney, Thyroid,
and Lung (mnemonic: Pb KTL, or “lead kettle"). Prostate cancer is the most common
malignancy in older men and frequently metastasizes to the axial skeleton and femur.

(Choice A) Degenerative disorders in the spine (eg, facet osteoarthritis) are typically relieved
with rest and while in bed overnight; this patient's constant pain that persists overnight is more
worrisome for malignancy.

(Choice B) Vertebral osteomyelitis (pain at rest, focal tenderness) and epidural abscess
(nerve root compression, radicular symptoms) can be associated with intravenous drug use
but typically occur following recent use, not decades later, and are usually associated with
systemic symptoms (eg, fever, night sweats).

(Choice C) Inflammatory back pain (eg, spondyloarthropathy) is characterized by slowly
progressive pain that is often worse at night. However, it is associated with prolonged morning
stiffness (eg, hours) and improves with exercise. In addition, onset almost always occurs at
age <45.

(Choice E) Back pain may be psychogenic (eg, factitious, malingering). Evidence of
secondary gain (eg, litigation/compensation) and an unusual pattern of signs and symptoms

can help identify these patients.
