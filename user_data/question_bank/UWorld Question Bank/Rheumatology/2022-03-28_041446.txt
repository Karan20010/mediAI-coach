(Choice B) The common interosseous artery is a short branch of the ulnar artery that gives
rise to anterior, posterior, and recurrent branches within the proximal forearm.

(Choice D) The anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries are branches of the axillary
artery that form an anastomosis encircling the surgical neck of the humerus in the
quadrangular space. The axillary nerve travels in close association with the posterior
circumflex artery, and a fracture to the surgical neck of the humerus may damage them.

(Choice E) The deep brachial artery divides into the radial and middle collateral arteries. The
radial collateral artery also courses with the radial nerve, but injury to this artery from a
midshaft fracture is less likely because it originates at the lower end of the spiral groove.

Educational objective:
The deep brachial (profunda brachii) artery and radial nerve run together along the posterior
aspect of the humerus. Midshaft fractures of the humerus risk injury to these structures.
