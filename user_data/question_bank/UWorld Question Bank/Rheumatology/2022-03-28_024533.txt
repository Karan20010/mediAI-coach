(Choice A) The biceps femoris, along with semitendinosus and semimembranosus, form the
hamstring muscle group in the posterior thigh that is responsible for hip extension and knee
flexion. These movements are made possible because the long head of biceps femoris
originates at the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the fibular head, crossing both the hip and
knee joints.

(Choice B) The psoas muscle originates at T12-L4 vertebrae and inserts at the lesser
trochanter of the femur, enabling it to function as a hip flexor. Because it does not cross the
knee, it does not contribute to leg movement.

(Choice E) Tensor fascia lata is a small muscle along the lateral thigh that originates from the
anterior superior iliac spine and inserts in the lateral condyle of the tibia via the iliotibial tract. It
works with the gluteus medius and gluteus minimus to abduct and medially rotate the hip.

Educational objective:

The rectus femoris, iliopsoas, and sartorius are the major hip flexors. Of these, only the rectus
femoris and sartorius also affect knee movement. The sartorius flexes the knee while the
rectus femoris extends the knee.
