(Choice E) The transversus abdominis (transversalis) muscle is the most internal of the
anterior abdominal wall muscles. It lies immediately deep to the internal oblique and helps to
flex the trunk as well as increase intraabdominal pressure during forced expiration.

Educational objective:

The psoas muscle originates from the anterior surface of the transverse processes and lateral
surface of the vertebral bodies and functions primarily as a hip flexor. Psoas abscess may
form due to direct spread of infection from an adjacent structure (eg, vertebral bodies,
appendix, hip joint) or from hematogenous seeding from a distant site.
