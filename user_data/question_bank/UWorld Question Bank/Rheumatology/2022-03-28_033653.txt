Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the first-line treatment for most patients
with acute gouty arthritis. They inhibit cyclooxygenase enzymes and therefore decrease
prostaglandin synthesis and exert a broad anti-inflammatory effect that includes inhibition of
neutrophils. NSAIDs should be avoided in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction or those
at high risk for peptic ulcers. Alternate agents for acute gout depend on patient tolerance and
comorbidities and include colchicine and oral or intraarticular glucocorticoids.

(Choice B) Lipoxygenase inhibitors (eg, zileuton) decrease production of proinflammatory
leukotrienes and are indicated for treatment of asthma.

(Choice C) TNF-alpha inhibitors (eg, infliximab, etanercept) are used as disease-modifying
agents in rheumatoid arthritis.

(Choices D and E) Uric acid—lowering therapy with uricosuric agents (eg, probenecid) or
xanthine oxidase inhibitors (eg, allopurinol, febuxostat) is used to prevent acute attacks in
patients with recurrent and progressive gouty arthritis and for those with macroscopic tophi.
However, these drugs should not be initiated during an acute gout attack because they can
exacerbate acute arthritis.

Educational objective:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first-line treatment for acute gouty arthritis. They
