A 68-year-old man comes to the office due to difficulty performing normal day-to-day activities
with his hands. He has had pain in his finger joints, wrists, and knees for many years and has
been taking over-the-counter analgesics. The patient has been evaluated by doctors for "joint
problems" in the past but declined their treatment recommendations. He has smoked a pack
of cigarettes daily for 30 years. Vital signs are normal. Examination findings of the patient's
hands are shown in the image below.
