The end result is a thickened, deformed bone that is weaker than normal and prone to fracture.
(Choice A) Chondrocytes are not involved in the pathogenesis of PDB.
(Choices B and C) In the early stages of PDB, the adjacent marrow spaces are replaced by

highly vascular stromal tissue as a result of increased endothelial cell and fibroblast
proliferation due to cytokines secreted by osteoclasts. The increased vascularity causes
arteriovenous shunting that can result in high-output heart failure.

(Choice D) Although this patient's bone biopsy shows findings characteristic of the
osteosclerotic (osteoblast-dominant) phase of Paget disease, the question is specifically
asking about the initial (osteolytic) phase of Paget disease, where osteoclast activity is
predominantly increased. Increased activity and dysregulation of osteoblasts and fibroblasts
increase the risk of developing sarcomas (eg, osteosarcoma) in patients with PDB.

Educational objective:

Bone pain and elevated alkaline phosphatase level in an elderly patient can occur with
osteoblast metastases and Paget disease of bone (PDB). Biopsy showing a mosaic pattern of
lamellar bone is diagnostic for PDB. The initial phase in PDB is characterized by an increase
in osteoclastic activity.
