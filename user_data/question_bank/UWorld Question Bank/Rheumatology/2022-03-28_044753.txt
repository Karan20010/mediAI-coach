occur independently or as a paraneoplastic TEESE of an underlying malignancy.
Polymyositis is an inflammatory myopathy triggered by unknown, possibly viral, antigens. It
likely represents a cell-mediated immune response against myocytes. Increased expression
of major histocompatibility complex class | antigens on the sarcolemma has been
demonstrated and likely leads to presentation of autoantigens to CD8- cytotoxic cells that
subsequently initiate myocyte destruction. Muscle biopsy in polymyositis reveals inflammation,
patchy necrosis, and regeneration and fibrosis of muscle fibers. Infiltration of the endomysium
by macrophages and CD8- lymphocytes is typically seen.

(Choice A) Joint involvement in systemic sclerosis may cause arthralgias and contractures,
but muscle weakness is not seen.

(Choices B and C) Myasthenia gravis is caused by anti-acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies
and is characterized by episodic weakness that initially affects the ocular/bulbar musculature.
The Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome is a paraneoplastic condition causing fatigable
weakness in the extremities; it is caused by autoantibodies to presynaptic calcium channels.
Light microscopy of muscle biopsy specimens is normal in these conditions.

(Choice D) Polyarteritis nodosa is an uncommon systemic vasculitis that presents with

intermittent episodes of abdominal pain, peripheral neuropathy, renal insufficiency, and severe
