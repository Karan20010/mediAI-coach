consistent with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The symptoms of RA may be relieved temporarily

with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or systemic glucocorticoids, but long-term use of

disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs is recommended to avoid progressive joint destruction.

In addition to the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints in the hands (and
metatarsophalangeal joints in the feet), RA may also involve the wrists, elbows, knees, and
ankles. Cervical spine involvement is also common in longstanding disease, and may lead to
severe pain and disability due to spinal instability with potential radiculopathy/cord
compression. The hips and lumbosacral joints are usually spared in RA.

(Choice B) The lumbar spine is only rarely involved in RA but is commonly affected by
osteoarthritis.

(Choice C) Arthritis of the sacroiliac joints is characteristic of the seronegative
spondyloarthropathies (ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, arthritis associated with
inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis). These conditions are seen most commonly in
patients who carry the human leukocyte antigen B27 allele.

(Choice D) Arthritis involving the thoracic spine is uncommon and is usually due to
osteoarthritis or spondyloarthritis.
