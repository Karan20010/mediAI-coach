This patient with acute atraumatic monoarticular arthritis involving the knee has typical
symptoms of gout. The usual first-line treatment of acute gouty arthritis is nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (eg, indomethacin), but these are relatively contraindicated in
patients with a history of peptic ulcer. Colchicine can also be used to treat acute gouty
arthritis and results in resolution of symptoms in most patients.

Colchicine works primarily by inhibiting microtubular polymerization. It binds to the tubulin
protein that helps form microtubules, preventing their aggregation. This in turn disrupts
cytoskeletal-dependent functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and degranulation.
Colchicine also reduces the formation of leukotriene B.. It does not have any effect on the
metabolism or urinary excretion of uric acid. Important adverse effects of colchicine are
nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Colchicine should not be used in elderly patients or
those with severe renal dysfunction.

(Choices A and E) Glucocorticoids inhibit the enzyme phospholipase A,, which converts
membrane phospholipids to arachidonic acid. This in turn decreases the formation of

inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Glucocorticoids can be given systemically or by
intra-articular injection for treatment of gout in patients who cannot take NSAIDs or colchicine.
