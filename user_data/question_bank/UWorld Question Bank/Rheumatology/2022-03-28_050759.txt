(Choice C) Deficiency of vitamin D can lead to osteoporosis. Risk factors include
malabsorption syndromes (eg, celiac disease) and lack of sun exposure, but nutritional
deficiency is not a common cause of vitamin D deficiency. Glucocorticoid use is likely a more
significant factor in this patient.

(Choice D) Loss of ovarian estrogen production after menopause leads to an increased risk
of osteoporosis. However, postmenopausal osteoporosis develops slowly, and fracture is
uncommon until at least 10-15 years after cessation of menses; this patient is still
perimenopausal, and loss of estrogen is unlikely to have caused her osteoporosis.

(Choice E) Involvement of the cervical spine is common in rheumatoid arthritis and, over time,
can lead to atlantoaxial instability, subluxation with possible cord compression, and odontoid
fracture. However, involvement of the thoracic and lumbar spine is uncommon.

Educational objective:

Osteoporosis is a common cause of fragility fractures, which occur in the absence of
significant trauma. Chronic or recurrent use of glucocorticoids (eg, prednisone) promotes
osteoporosis and increases the risk of fractures.
