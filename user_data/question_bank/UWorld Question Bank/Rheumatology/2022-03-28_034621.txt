This adolescent athlete has spondylolisthesis (ie, anterior displacement of the vertebral body),
which often occurs due to bilateral spondylolysis (ie, pars interarticularis fracture).

The vertebral column is formed by stacked vertebra separated by cartilaginous discs held
together by thick ligaments:

¢ The vertebral bodies form the anterior, weight-bearing portion of the vertebral column.

¢ The posterior portion of the vertebral column contains the midline spinous process, the
transverse processes, and the articulating processes of the facet joints.

¢ The posterior vertebral arch connects the anterior and posterior portions of the vertebral
column and consists of the pedicle, the intervening pars interarticularis, and the
lamina. The posterior vertebral arch and the posterior portion of the vertebral body form
the triangularly shaped spinal canal.

Each vertebra has an anterior joint between the vertebral bodies separated by discs and a pair
of facet joints posteriorly. Forward flexion of the spine stresses the anterior portion of the
spine, including the vertebral bodies and discs; repetitive extension of the spine (as in
gymnasts) stresses the facet joints and posterior vertebral arch, which can lead to
spondylolysis with subsequent spondylolisthesis.
