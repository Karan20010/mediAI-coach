A 34-year-old woman comes to the office with several months of vision problems, difficulty
chewing, and trouble speaking. The symptoms fluctuate, but the patient has noticed that they
are worse after a long day. She works as a telemarketer and has been putting in increasingly
long hours to meet her quotas. Regarding her symptoms, she says, "It's probably just
exhaustion; an ice pack to my face seems to help." During physical examination, the patient is
asked to keep her eyes focused on a spot on the ceiling, and after 2 minutes, her vision
becomes blurry. The remainder of the examination is normal. Further evaluation shows that
the patient's symptoms are reversible on administration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor.
The pathogenesis of this patient's disease is most similar to which of the following conditions?

A. Atopic dermatitis (3%)
B. Contact dermatitis (3%)
Y_ C. Goodpasture syndrome (82%)
D. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (3%)

E. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (6%)
