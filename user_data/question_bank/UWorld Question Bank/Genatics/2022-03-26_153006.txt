A 34-year-old woman comes to the office due to dysuria. The patient has a history of recurrent
urinary tract infections. A urine sample is collected and sent for culture. Gram-negative
bacteria isolated from the urine are found to form pink colonies on lactose-containing
MacConkey agar. Several days later, bacterial isolates from a second urine sample are found
to form white colonies when plated on the same type of medium. Genetic analysis shows that
the more recent isolates have a single nucleotide deletion within the Jac operon DNA
sequence. This genomic change is most consistent with which of the following?

©) A. Conservative mutation
©) B. Frameshift mutation
(©) C. Missense mutation

©) D. Nonsense mutation
