TTN gene mutations follow autosomal dominant inheritance; however, they have incomplete
penetrance, leading to delayed or absent clinical manifestations in some family members.

(Choice A) Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is characterized by fibrosis and
scarring of right ventricular myocardium, which predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias and
sudden cardiac death. The disease results from impaired desmosome function due to
mutations in genes encoding desmosomal proteins (eg, plakoglobin, desmoplakin).

(Choice B) Familial bicuspid aortic valve disease has been associated with a mutation
affecting the NOTCH7 gene that encodes transcription regulatory proteins.

(Choice D) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in
young patients. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and most commonly involves
mutations in the genes encoding beta-myosin heavy chain or myosin-binding protein C.

(Choice E) Restrictive cardiomyopathy most commonly results from infiltrative disease (eg,
amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, sarcoidosis); however, familial disease does occur. Familial
restrictive cardiomyopathy typically involves mutations in genes encoding one of several
sarcomere or cytoskeletal proteins, but mutations of the TTN gene are not a well-established

cause.
