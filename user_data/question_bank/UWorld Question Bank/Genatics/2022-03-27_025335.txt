(Choice C) The RB tumor suppressor gene (antioncogene) is located on chromosome 13.
Mutations of this gene lead to the development of retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma.

(Choice E) Mutations of the W7-7 tumor suppressor gene are associated with the
development of Wilms tumor. This gene is located on chromosome 11.

Educational objective:

Sporadic and hereditary (associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease) renal cell carcinomas are
associated with mutations involving the VHL gene on chromosome 3p. The VHL gene is a
tumor suppressor that inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors; mutations lead to constitutive
activation of these proteins, resulting in the activation of multiple angiogenic and tumorigenic
growth factors (eg, VEG-F, PDG-F).
