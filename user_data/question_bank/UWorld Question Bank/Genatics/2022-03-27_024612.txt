Down syndrome is most commonly caused by random meiotic nondisjunction, an abnormality
that correlates with increasing maternal age and results in 3 complete copies of chromosome
21 (47, XX, +21).
Translocation Down syndrome, which is less common, can be inherited from an unaffected
parent with a balanced translocation. Robertsonian translocations occur between 2
acrocentric, nonhomologous chromosomes (eg, 14 and 21). The resultant translocated
chromosomes are the fusion of 2 long arms (eg, 14q and 21q [red arrow]) and the fusion of 2
short arms (eg, 14p and 21p); the latter usually contains nonessential genetic material and is
lost after several cell divisions. The affected parent is asymptomatic because they have a
normal (albeit rearranged) genetic complement. However, when an ovum containing the
translocated chromosome and a normal chromosome 21 is fertilized with a sperm containing a
normal set of chromosomes (ie, 1 copy of chromosome 21), the resultant fetus has an
unbalanced Robertsonian translocation with 46 chromosomes and 3 effective copies of
chromosome 21 [46,XX, t(14;21)]. Another possible maternal gamete includes 0 copies of
chromosome 21, which increases the rate of miscarriages in balanced Robertsonian

translocation carriers.
