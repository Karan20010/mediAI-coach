Nondisjunction is the failure of chromosome pairs to separate properly during cell
division. This could be due to a failure of homologous chromosomes to separate in meiosis
lor a failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis Il or mitosis. In monosomy, a
single chromosome is lost. In trisomy, a single chromosome is gained. Monosomies or
trisomies can result from nondisjunction in meiosis | or Il.

Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis shows that both parents
demonstrate 2 bands. Each parental band represents a homologous chromosome 21. The
child has 3 bands, indicating that he has 3 different versions of chromosome 21 that he
obtained from his parents. He received the lower band from the father and both of the upper
bands from the mother. The fact that he received 2 different bands from the mother indicates
that he inherited both of her homologous chromosomes. Therefore, the problem occurred in
the mother during meiosis |, when homologous chromosomes are separated. In fact, the vast
majority of Down syndrome cases arise due to nondisjunction during maternal meiosis I.

(Choice B) If the mother had a failure in meiosis II, the child’s RFLP analysis would reveal
only two bands (see example). There would be a single band from the father and a darker,
thicker band from the mother. The darker, thicker band signifies the inheritance of both sister
chromatids, which will produce equal-size restriction fragments (but twice the normal amount).
