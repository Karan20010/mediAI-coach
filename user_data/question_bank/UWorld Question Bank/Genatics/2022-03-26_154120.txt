Question Id: 883

This patient likely has xeroderma pigmentosum, a rare autosomal recessive disorder that
occurs due to defective nucleotide excision repair of DNA damaged by ultraviolet (UV) light.
Normally, the regions of DNA damaged by UV radiation are excised and replaced by a series
of DNA repair enzymes. In xeroderma pigmentosum, this process is impaired and leads to the
accumulation of abnormal pyrimidine nucleotides and other carcinogenic adducts.

The skin of affected individuals is normal at birth, but they present during the first year of life
with severe sun sensitivity (eg, erythema, scaling) affecting light-exposed areas, especially the
face. Later, the skin shows atrophy, telangiectasias, and intermingling areas of hypo- and
hyperpigmentation due to chronic UV damage. Skin malignancies, including malignant
melanoma and squamous and basal cell carcinoma, develop as early as ages 5-6.

(Choice A) Abnormalities of genes responsible for DNA mismatch repair are found in patients
with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome). These patients
have a greater incidence of colorectal, endometrial, and ovarian cancer.

(Choice C) Ras codes for a G protein that regulates growth factor signal transduction.
Mutations that result in a constitutively activated Ras protein cause constant and unregulated
cell proliferation, leading to malignancy (particularly pancreatic and colorectal cancer).
