The image above shows the "cloverleaf" secondary structure of transfer RNA (tRNA), a small,
noncoding subtype of RNA that is responsible for transporting amino acids to the site of protein
synthesis and introducing them into the growing polypeptide chain at the correct locations.

The acceptor stem of tRNA is created through the base pairing of the 5'-terminal nucleotides
with the 3'-terminal nucleotides. It contains the CCA tail, which is added to the 3’ end of tRNA
as a post-transcriptional modification and serves as the amino acid binding site. Aminoacyl
tRNA synthetase is the enzyme responsible for "loading" the appropriate amino acid to the 3'
terminal hydroxyl group of the CCA tail. The acceptor stem helps mediate correct tRNA
recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

(Choice B) The T loop contains the TYC sequence, which is necessary for the binding of
tRNA to ribosomes. The TVYC sequence refers to the presence of the chemically modified
bases ribothymidine and pseudouridine, and cytidine.

(Choice C) The variable loop contains a variable number of bases that lie between the T and

anticodon loops. The variable loop is not present in all tRNAs.

(Choice D) The anticodon loop contains sequences that are complementary to the mRNA
codon. During translation, the tRNA anticodon binds to the mRNA codon and assures
placement of the proper amino acid in the growing polypeptide chain.
