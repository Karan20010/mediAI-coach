Congenital hypothyroidism is one of the most common causes of preventable intellectual
disability. Most cases are due to thyroid dysgenesis (agenesis, hypoplasia, or ectopy), and
iodine deficiency is a common cause in areas endemic for iodine deficiency (eg, Europe).
Neonates initially have no significant symptoms due to the presence of maternal thyroxine (T,)
from transplacental transfer. T, is responsible for the stimulation of protein synthesis as well as
carbohydrate and lipid catabolism in many cells; as maternal T, wanes, metabolism is impaired
and marked by a slowing of physical and mental activity (lethargy, poor feeding, constipation,
hypotonia). Accumulation of matrix substances cutaneously and internally results in nonpitting
edema (eg, "puffy" face), umbilical hernia, protruding tongue, and a large anterior fontanelle.
In addition, T, is essential for normal brain development and myelination during early life, and

infants are at risk of severe and irreversible intellectual disability.

Treatment with levothyroxine by age 2 weeks can normalize cognitive and physical
development.

Therefore, universal newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism is performed in the
United States but not in all other countries.
