(Choice B) Mitochondrial diseases (eg, MELAS syndrome, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy)
are maternally inherited. The variable severity of these diseases is explained by
heteroplasmy, the random distribution of normal and mutated mitochondrial DNA between
daughter cells during meiosis. As a result, some eggs may have completely healthy
mitochondria, while other cells contain mitochondria affected by genetic mutation.

(Choice C) Penetrance is the probability that a person with a given genotype will express its
associated phenotype. Incomplete penetrance means that some individuals with an abnormal
genotype will not express the corresponding phenotype (eg, breast cancer in individuals with
BRCA1/2 mutations).

(Choice D) Two allele loci are said to be in linkage disequilibrium when a pair of alleles is
inherited together in the same gamete (haplotype) more often or less often than would be
expected given random pairing. This most often occurs when the genes are in close physical
proximity on the same chromosome.

(Choice F) The occurrence of multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic manifestations (often
in different organ systems as a result of a single genetic defect) is termed pleiotrophy.
Although this may apply to features of oculocutaneous albinism (eg, absence of melanin in
skin, reduced visual acuity, nystagmus), it does not explain why a child of two affected parents
