*Repeat length correlates with earlier onset of more severe disease.

This child with intellectual disability has weakness and slow muscle relaxation, findings
suggestive of myotonic dystrophy (DM). DM is an autosomal dominant muscular dystrophy
due to an expansion of CTG trinucleotide repeats within the dystrophia myotonica protein
kinase (DMPK) gene. Increased repeat length occurs with successive generations and is

associated with earlier onset of more severe disease (ie, anticipation); this patient's parent with

mild muscle weakness is most likely due to adult-onset DM.

In the childhood form of DM, intellectual disability and behavioral problems are often the
predominant features. Other key findings characteristic of classic DM may be present or
develop over time:

¢ Weakness, atrophy, and pain of facial and distal limb musculature

¢ Myotonia, or delay in muscle relaxation, such as sustained hand contraction after

attempted grip release or sustained thumb abduction after thenar eminence percussion (as

seen here)
¢ Cardiac abnormalities (eg, conduction disturbances, cardiomyopathy)

¢ Gastrointestinal tract disturbances (eg, dysphagia, constipation)
