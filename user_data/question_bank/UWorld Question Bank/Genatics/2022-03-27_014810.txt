typically found around the periphery). However, most of the ribosomal DNA is found in the
form of tandem repeats within the nucleolus; only the 5S rRNA is transcribed outside of the
nucleolus.

(Choice D) Mitochondria are organelles with dual phospholipid bilayer membranes that can
be recognized by the presence of foldings (ie, cristae) in their inner membranes. Mitochondria
have their own ribosomes, but they are typically found within the mitochondrial matrix or bound
to the inner mitochondrial membrane.

(Choice E) Pancreatic zymogen granules are electron-dense structures containing digestive
proenzymes that are released from the cell via exocytosis.

Educational objective:

The nucleolus is a dense intranuclear body visible by light and electron microscopy that
functions as the primary site of ribosome synthesis and assembly. All ribosomal RNA except
5S rRNA is transcribed in the nucleolus.
