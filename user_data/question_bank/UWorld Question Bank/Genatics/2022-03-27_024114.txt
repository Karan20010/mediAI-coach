A pharmaceutical researcher develops a therapy to treat a protein misfolding disorder.
Specifically, a mutation in this disorder leads to abnormal protein folding and subsequent
intracellular degradation of the protein before it can reach the cell membrane. With the new
combination drug therapy, the first drug corrects the processing and trafficking of the protein,
enabling it to reach the cell surface membrane. Once the protein has reached the cell surface,
its function is enhanced by the second drug. This therapy is most likely to be helpful in which

of the following conditions?
