To be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, an offspring must inherit 2 copies of the
mutant allele (a), a copy from the mother and another copy from the father (in this case, the
sperm donor).

In this example, genetic analysis confirms that the mother is a carrier (Aa), which gives her a
50% chance of passing 1 mutant allele (a) to her child.

The sperm donor does not have Pompe disease, but his carrier status is unknown (ie, he
has either an AA or Aa genotype). Given that he has no family history of the disease, his risk
of being a carrier is the same as that of the general population. Hardy-Weinberg analysis
can be used to estimate the frequency of alleles and genotypes in the general population:

¢ The total gene pool is given by (p + q) = 1. By convention, p = normal allele (A) frequency
and q = mutant allele (a) frequency in the population of interest.

¢ Disease frequency is equivalent to the proportion of homozygous recessive individuals.
These affected individuals have 2 copies of the mutant allele (aa); therefore, the frequency
of affected individuals = q x q = qz.

¢ Carrier frequency is equal to the proportion of heterozygous individuals. Carriers have
only 1 mutant allele that may be inherited in 2 different ways (ie, Aa or aA); consequently,
