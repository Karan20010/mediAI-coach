Primase Okazaki fragment
OvWorid

This patient has Bloom syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations
in the BLM gene. This gene encodes DNA helicase, an enzyme responsible for unwinding of
the double helix during DNA replication and repair. Helicase dysfunction results in
chromosomal instability and breakage and manifests clinically with growth retardation, facial

infections).

DNA replication occurs during the S phase (synthesis phase) of the cell cycle and is
