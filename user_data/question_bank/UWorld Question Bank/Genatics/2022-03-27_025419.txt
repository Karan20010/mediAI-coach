The neuromuscular lesions, ragged skeletal muscle fibers, and lactic acidosis in these family
members suggest mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Mitochondrial disorders follow a
maternal inheritance pattern because an embryo's mitochondria are inherited from the ovum

only.

Mitochondria are responsible for ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation, which is why
mitochondrial defects tend to cause lactic acidosis and primarily affect tissues with the highest
metabolic rates (eg, neural tissue, muscular tissue). Although many mitochondrial proteins are
coded for in the nuclear genome, mitochondria also contain their own genome, which is
vulnerable to mutations. Each cell has hundreds of mitochondria, and defects in their genome
may occur in any number of the mitochondria within the cell. Heteroplasmy describes the
condition of having different mitochondrial genomes within a single cell. The severity of
mitochondrial diseases is often directly related to the proportion of abnormal to normal
mitochondria within a patient's cells.

(Choice A) Anticipation refers to increased severity or earlier onset of an inherited disease in
successive generations. It is commonly seen in autosomal and X-linked trinucleotide repeat
disorders due to trinucleotide amplification during gametogenesis.

(Choice C) Penetrance is the probability that a person with a given genotype will express its
