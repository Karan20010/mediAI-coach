¢ Allogeneic donors: Donors who do not have the same genome as the patient are
classified as related or unrelated.

Related donors: Because HLA alleles are encoded on chromosome 6, each
nonidentical sibling has a 25% chance of being an exact HLA match (HLA identical), a
50% chance of sharing half the HLA alleles (haploidentical), and a 25% chance of
sharing none of the HLA alleles (HLA mismatch). Therefore, siblings often are tested
first for HLA matching because there is a 1:4 chance they will be an exact match.
However, unmatched siblings usually are not used for donation because their HLA
alleles are not the same as the patient's (Choice E).

Unrelated donors: Unrelated donors do not have the same genome as the patient
but can have perfect or near-perfect HLA matching; however, extensive searching is
often required. Matched unrelated donors generally are best for congenital
genetic conditions because the genomic error that leads to the patient's condition will

not usually be present in an unrelated individual.
