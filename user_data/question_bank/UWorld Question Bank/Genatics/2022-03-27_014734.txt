improperly charged with alanine, as described in the experiment above, alanine will be
incorrectly incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain in place of cysteine (Choice A).

(Choice C) During polypeptide chain elongation, ribosomes move from codon to codon on
mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction, sequentially adding amino acids from aminoacyl-tRNA to the
peptide chain. This continues until the ribosome encounters a stop codon (ie, UAA, UAG, or
UGA). Releasing factors then assist in polypeptide chain termination.

(Choice D) DNAglycosylases are enzymes involved in DNA base excision repair.

Educational objective:

The sequence of amino acids in a growing polypeptide chain is dictated by the interaction of
the mRNA codon with the tRNA anticodon. tRNA that is mischarged with the incorrect amino
acid (and not corrected by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase proofreading) will incorporate the
wrong amino acid into the growing polypeptide chain.
