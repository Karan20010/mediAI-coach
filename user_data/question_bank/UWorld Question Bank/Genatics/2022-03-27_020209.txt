(Choice C) Genetic transition refers to a point mutation that results in replacement of a purine
nucleotide for another purine or a pyrimidine nucleotide for another pyrimidine. In contrast,
transversion refers to a point mutation that results in the replacement of a purine nucleotide for
a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine nucleotide for a purine.

(Choice D) The genetic code is almost universal as amino acid codons are nearly identical
across species; however, mitochondria and some bacteria and single-celled eukaryotes
deviate from the standard genetic code.

Educational objective:

The genetic code is considered "degenerate" because more than 1 codon can code for a
particular amino acid. Some of this degeneracy is explained by the wobble hypothesis, which
states that the first 2 nucleotide positions on the mRNA codon require traditional (Watson-
Crick) base pairing, whereas the third "wobble" nucleotide position may undergo less stringent
(nontraditional) base pairing.
