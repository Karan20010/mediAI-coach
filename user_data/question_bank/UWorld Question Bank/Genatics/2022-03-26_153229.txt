This patient has cystic fibrosis, which occurs due to mutations affecting the cystic fibrosis
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The vignette states that the patient's
mutation affects an exon, meaning that the mutation will be detectable in the mRNA
sequence. Complementary DNA (cDNA) is double-stranded DNA that is synthesized from an
mRNA template. In this case, CDNA was synthesized using CFTR mRNA from the patient and
his brother. Subsequent gel electrophoresis shows that the patient's cDNA is 28 base pairs
shorter than that of his brother, indicating the patient has a 28-base pair deletion affecting the
coding region of CFTR. Deletion or insertion of a number of bases that is not divisible by 3
results in frameshift mutations. As the name implies, frameshift mutations alter the reading
frame of the genetic code, resulting in the formation of nonfunctional proteins due to the
incorporation of many incorrect amino acids.

(Choice B) One or more complete codons (genetic triplet codes) are removed in an in-frame
deletion, which does not affect the reading frame of subsequent codons. This patient's 28-
base pair deletion is not divisible by 3, so it will result in a reading frame shift.

(Choices C and D) Missense and nonsense mutations are due to single base substitutions
that result in the placement of an incorrect amino acid or introduction of a premature stop
codon, respectively. These mutations occur in exons and affect protein translation. However,
