Genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. Most eukaryotic DNA sequences
consist of coding exons, noncoding introns, and 2 promoter regions (the CAAT box and the
TATA box). The CAAT box is located 70-80 bases upstream of the beginning (5' end) of the
coding region, and the TATA box is located 25 bases upstream from the beginning of the
coding region.
Gene transcription begins when RNA polymerase II attaches to one of the promoter regions
in a process that requires general transcription factors. ADNA enhancer region then binds
activator proteins that associate with transcription factors and RNA polymerase II at the
promoter, thereby increasing gene expression. Although promoters are not directly translated
into protein, promoter mutations can cause abnormal gene expression by altering the ability of
RNA polymerase II and transcription factors to bind.

(Choice A) DNA methylation is part of the epigenetic code. This process is carried out by
DNA methyltransferases and serves to silence the genes it affects.

(Choice B) The folding of a formed polypeptide into its secondary and tertiary structures is
entirely spontaneous and is determined by the amino acid sequence in the protein's primary
structure. Heat shock proteins assist in the spontaneous refolding of proteins.
