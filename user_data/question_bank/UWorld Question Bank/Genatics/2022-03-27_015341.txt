(Choice B) A frameshift mutation is a genetic mutation in which a number of nucleotides not
divisible by 3 are inserted into or removed from a coding DNA sequence. As a result, the
reading frame is shifted during protein translation, resulting in an entirely different peptide
sequence (typically with formation of a premature stop codon).

(Choice D) Trinucleotide repeat expansion is responsible for numerous diseases, including
fragile X syndrome (CGG repeats), myotonic dystrophy (CTG repeats), and Huntington
disease (CAG repeats).

(Choice E) Uniparental disomy occurs when an individual inherits 2 copies of a chromosome
from one parent and no copies of the chromosome from the other parent. For instance,
although most often due to chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy can also cause
Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes due to loss of expression of maternal/paternal
imprinted components of a critical region of chromosome 15.

Educational objective:

Patients with Turner syndrome may have karyotype 45,X (complete monosomy), 45,X/46,XX
(mosaicism), or 46,XX (with partial deletion of one X chromosome). Complete monosomy X
usually results from meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis.
