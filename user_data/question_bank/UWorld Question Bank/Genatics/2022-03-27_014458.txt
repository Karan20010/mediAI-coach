This patient's clinical presentation is consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).
Many patients with HCM are asymptomatic and are recognized when an abnormal murmur or
ECG is noted during evaluation for other purposes. HCM typically involves left ventricular (LV)
enlargement that is most prominent in the basal anterior septum and can lead to LV outflow
tract obstruction. The clinical manifestations, which depend on the extent of hypertrophy and
outflow tract obstruction, include:

¢ exertional dyspnea, chest pain, fatigue, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope. Sudden
cardiac arrest can also occur.

¢ a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the apex and left sternal
border, with characteristic changes in intensity during physiologic maneuvers.

The condition is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, resulting from mutations in genes
encoding for myocardial contractile proteins of the sarcomere. The proteins cardiac myosin
binding protein C and cardiac beta-myosin heavy chain are most commonly affected. The
phenotypic manifestations of the disease (eg, septal enlargement) typically begin to develop
around the time of adolescence.
