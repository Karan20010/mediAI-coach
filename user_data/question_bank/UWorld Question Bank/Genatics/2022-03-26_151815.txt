Western blotting is used to detect a target polypeptide or protein from within a mixed
sample. Potential target proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis. The separated
proteins are then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a primary
antibody specific for the protein of interest. The membrane is then washed and treated with a
(secondary) marked antibody that binds to the primary antibody and can be detected (eg, by
colorimetry).

For example, a serum sample from a patient with suspected HIV infection can be analyzed via
Western blot to detect antibodies directed against specific viral proteins. Following separation
of viral proteins by gel electrophoresis and protein transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane, the
membrane is treated with the patient's serum. Patients who are HIV positive are likely to have
antibodies that react with viral p24, gp41, and gp120/160. If 2 of these 3 bands are positive,
the test is considered positive.

Western blotting is similar to the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique;
however, in ELISA the patient's serum is tested directly, whereas in Western blotting the
proteins are first separated by electrophoresis.
