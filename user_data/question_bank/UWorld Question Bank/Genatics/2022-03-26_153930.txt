DNA replication begins at multiple sites within eukaryotic chromosomes called origins of
replication. At these sites, the parent DNA double helix is separated and unwound in a
process facilitated by the helicase enzyme and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins. The
locations where unwound DNA meets the double helix are known as replication forks.
Replication forks travel bidirectionally away from the origin of replication as DNA polymerase
synthesizes complementary daughter DNA strands.

Synthesis of the daughter strands occurs simultaneously from both parent strands. Because
DNA synthesis can occur only in the 5'â€”3' direction, one daughter strand is synthesized
continuously toward the replication fork (leading strand). However, the other strand must be
synthesized discontinuously in a direction away from the replication fork (lagging strand),
with more and more segments being added as the replication fork moves across the DNA
double helix. This results in the formation of Okazaki fragments, short stretches of newly
synthesized DNA that are separated by RNA primers. These primers are removed and
replaced with DNA, and the Okazaki fragments are subsequently joined together by DNA
ligase.
