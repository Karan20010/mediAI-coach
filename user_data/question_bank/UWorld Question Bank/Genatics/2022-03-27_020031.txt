A 6-year-old girl with chronic anemia requiring repeated blood transfusions is undergoing
genetic testing. The patient's mother and older sibling have a history of mild anemia. Her
peripheral blood smear shows hypochromic, microcytic red blood cells, and hemoglobin
electrophoresis reveals a predominance of hemoglobins F and A2. Sequencing of the B-globin
gene is performed using the patient's erythroblast DNA. A schematic representation of the
gene and its transcribed RNA is shown in the image below.
