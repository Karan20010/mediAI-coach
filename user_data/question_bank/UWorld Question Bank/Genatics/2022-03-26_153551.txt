(Choice A) DNA methylation (only cytosine and adenine) typically inhibits gene transcription.
Demethylation or hypomethylation of oncogenes (and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor
genes) contributes to the development of some cancers.

(Choice B) DNAcross-linking can be induced by numerous chemical and physical agents,
notably alkylating agents used in cancer treatment.

(Choice D) During DNA replication, incorrect base placement can occur, but enzymes scan
the newly synthesized DNA strands for mismatched bases, which are then excised and
replaced. This process is guided by the presence of adenine methylation (recognized by the
enzymes) in the template strand, as the daughter strand remains unmethylated for some time
following DNA replication.

(Choice E) DNA damage from exposure to ultraviolet radiation, a non-ionizing radiation, leads
to the formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine dimers (thymine dimers). lonizing radiation has
higher energy (enough to remove an electron), leading to more cell damage.

Educational objective:
Exposure to ionizing radiation, including therapeutic and palliative radiation therapy, induces
DNA damage through DNA double-strand fractures and the formation of oxygen free radicals.
