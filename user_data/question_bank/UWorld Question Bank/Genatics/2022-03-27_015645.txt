Most women with Turner syndrome (45,XO) are infertile secondary to ovarian failure. With
sufficient estrogen and progestin supplementation, however, these women can develop a thick
endometrial lining that is substantial enough to support a pregnancy. In vitro fertilization of
Turner syndrome patients with an ovum provided by a related or anonymous donor results in
pregnancy rates approaching 60%. A thorough renal, cardiac and thyroid examination should
be carried out before pregnancy is attempted to reduce the potential for complications during
pregnancy. Pregnancy can occur spontaneously in some patients with Turner syndrome, but
the risk of spontaneous abortion, Down syndrome and Turner syndrome are all increased in
such cases.

(Choice A) Bromocriptine is a dopamine receptor agonist that inhibits pituitary prolactin
secretion. It can restore fertility in women with hyperprolactinemia.

(Choice B) Clomiphene citrate is an antiestrogen that stimulates ovulation by blocking the
feedback inhibition of estrogen on the hypothalamus thereby enhancing the release of pituitary
gonadotropins. It is best used to achieve fertility in women with ovulatory failure who are
normogonadotropic, normoprolactinemic and euthyroid.
