Hematologic stem cell transplantation (HCT) requires identification of a donor with similar
human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), polymorphic proteins expressed on the surface of every
cell. The most important HLA proteins to match are HLA-A, B, and C, which form major
histocompatibility complex class | molecules, and HLA-DP, DQ, and DR, which form major
histocompatibility complex class Il molecules. Because these HLAs play a vital role in the
differentiation between self and nonself, recipients who receive well-matched donor cells have
lower rates of graft rejection (ie, host cells attack the donor) and graft-versus-host disease (ie,

donor cells attack the host).
Donor sources are generally categorized as follows:

e Autologous: Stem cells harvested from the patient or banked from the patient's cord
blood at birth are transplanted to reconstitute the patient's bone marrow. However,
autologous transplants cannot be used for congenital genetic disorders because the
genetic mutation will be present in all cells harvested from the patient (Choices A and C).

¢ Syngenetic: Identical twins have the same genome; therefore, cells transplanted from
one identical twin to the other will be an exact HLA match and will not cause graft rejection
or graft-versus-host disease. However, syngenetic transplants are not helpful for
congenital genetic conditions because any congenital mutation present in one twin will be
