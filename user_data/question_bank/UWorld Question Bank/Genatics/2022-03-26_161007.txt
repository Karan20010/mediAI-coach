In genetically normal (46,XX) females, one X chromosome is normally randomly deactivated in
each cell during early embryonic development. X-inactivation (lyonization) is maintained
across cell division, resulting in clusters of cells throughout the body that express either the
maternal or paternal X chromosome. This mosaic pattern of X-chromosome expression
generally prevents X-linked recessive conditions from manifesting in female carriers.

However, in rare cases, skewed lyonization (uneven inactivation of maternal/paternal X
chromosome due to chance alone) may result in females developing an X-linked recessive
condition (eg, classic hemophilia).

The process of lyonization converts the inactive X chromosome into condensed
heterochromatin, which can be identified on microscopy as a compact body at the periphery
of the nucleus (Barr body). Heterochromatin consists of heavily methylated DNA (eg,
cytosine converted to methylcytosine) and deacetylated histones, which cause it to have a
low level of transcriptional activity (Choice C). Asmall proportion of genes remain
transcriptionally active on the inactivated X chromosome. For this reason, inheritance of an
abnormal number of X chromosomes can cause clinical manifestations due to a gene-dosage
effect, as seen with Turner (45,XO) and Klinefelter (47,XXY) syndromes.

(Choice A) During DNA replication, positive supercoiling occurs in the region ahead of the
