Nucleosomes are structural subunits within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells that are composed
of DNA wrapped around a core of histone proteins. There are 5 major subtypes of histones:

H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Each histone core is made up of 8 histone proteins: 2 molecules
each of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Choices B and C). During the initial steps of DNA packaging
into chromatin, the negatively charged DNA double helix wraps around the positively charged

histone core twice.

In contrast to the other histone proteins, H1 is located outside of the histone core. H1
histones bind the linker segments of DNA that lie between nucleosomes and facilitate
packaging of nucleosomes into more compact structures. DNA associated with histones has
the appearance of "beads on a string." This structure undergoes further rounds of coiling and
associates with other proteins (eg, nuclear scaffold protein), ultimately forming chromosomes.

(Choice D) Small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (SnRNPs) help to splice out introns from pre-
mRNA, forming mature MRNA.
(Choice E) During prokaryotic DNA replication, topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) relieves the

tension created during DNA strand unwinding by introducing negative supercoils into the DNA.

(Choice F) Ubiquitin is a small protein present in the cytoplasm and nucleus of all
eukaryotes. It is typically covalently attached to various intracellular proteins to signal for their
