In an experiment, cultured fibroblasts are mechanically lysed, and the membrane lipids and
cellular proteins are chemically removed to isolate nucleic acids. The cellular extract
containing the purified nucleic acids is incubated along with short sequences of repeated
deoxythymidine residues fixed to latex beads. The solution is washed several times to remove
unbound molecules. Which of the following types of nucleic acid is most likely to bind the
strongest to the latex beads in this experiment?

A. Aminoacyl-tRNA (13%)
JY B. Mature mRNA (28%)
C. Promoter regions of DNA (28%)
D. Ribosomal RNA (7%)
E. Splice sites of pre-mRNA (5%)

F. Telomere regions of chromosomes (15%)
