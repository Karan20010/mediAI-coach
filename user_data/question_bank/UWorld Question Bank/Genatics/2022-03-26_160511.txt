This patient presenting with skeletal abnormalities, lens dislocation, intellectual deficits,
vascular thromboses, and a genetic defect in the cystathionine beta-synthase enzyme likely
has homocystinuria. The occurrence of multiple, seemingly unrelated phenotypic
manifestations, often in different organ systems, as a result of a single genetic defect is
termed pleiotropy. Most syndromic genetic illnesses including homocystinuria exhibit
pleiotropy.

(Choice A) Dominant negative mutations occur when an abnormal gene negatively affects the
product of the wild-type gene in the same cell. For example, certain oncogene p53 mutations
can lead to translation of a protein product that prevents wild-type p53 from binding to the
promoter of its target genes.

(Choice B) Genetic linkage describes the tendency of alleles located near one another on the
same chromosome to be inherited jointly.

(Choice C) Penetrance refers to the proportion of individuals with a given genotype that
express the associated phenotype. In incomplete penetrance, less than 100% of individuals
with a given genotype express its associated phenotype.

(Choice D) Locus heterogeneity refers to the ability of one disease or trait to be caused by ctivate V
