(Choice C) Mitral stenosis is seen in rheumatic heart disease. It produces a mid-diastolic,
low-pitched, rumbling murmur that may begin with an opening snap.

(Choice D) A mid-systolic click, often accompanied by a late systolic murmur, is the hallmark
of mitral valve prolapse (MVP). MVP is more common in connective tissue disorders such as
Marfan and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.

(Choice E) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) produces a continuous, machinelike murmur
during both systole and diastole. PDA is common in premature infants, especially those with
respiratory distress syndrome. A PDA may also be seen in an infant with coarctation of the
aorta but is less likely in older patients.

Educational objective:

Turner syndrome is associated with congenital anomalies of the aorta, and the most common
defect is a bicuspid aortic valve. A nonstenotic bicuspid aortic valve can manifest as an early
systolic, high-frequency click over the right second interspace. Bicuspid aortic valves are at
risk for stenosis, insufficiency, and infection.
