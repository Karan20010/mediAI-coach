in this scenario, gel electrophoresis is being performed on cDNA (not protein) and the
results indicate the length of the mature RNA transcript. Termination of RNA transcription
occurs by specific sequences in the 3' untranslated region that cause RNA hairpin loop
formation and/or recruitment of termination factors. As a result, point mutations in the exons of
a gene (such as those responsible for causing nonsense mutations) are unlikely to affect total
mRNA (cDNA) size.

(Choice E) Silent mutations can occur in both coding and noncoding regions, but they do not
alter protein quantity or function and do not affect phenotype. This patient's mutation caused
him to develop cystic fibrosis, so it is not a silent mutation.

(Choice F) Trinucleotide expansions increase the number of trinucleotide repeats in the
coding region of a gene, often resulting in large proteins with abnormal function. This patient's
abnormal CFTR gene is shorter (not longer) than the normal gene from his sibling, which
indicates a deletion has occurred.

Educational objective:

Deletion or addition of a number of bases that is not divisible by 3 in the coding region of a

gene will cause a frameshift mutation. Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame of the

genetic code, resulting in the formation of nonfunctional proteins. Activate \
