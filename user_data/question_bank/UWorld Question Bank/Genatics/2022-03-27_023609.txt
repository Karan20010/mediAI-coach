(due to abnormally thick mucus). A more specific test for CF is the nasal transepithelial
potential difference. In addition, CBAVD is virtually pathognomonic for a CFTR mutation.

(Choice C) Low serum alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is associated with AAT deficiency and not
with CF. AAT deficiency is typically associated with panacinar emphysema and chronic liver
disease. Infertility is not seen in these patients.

(Choices D and F) FSH, LH, and testosterone levels are usually normal in patients with CF.
A low testosterone level in the setting of decreased FSH and LH is seen in hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism (eg, Kallmann syndrome).

(Choice E) Primary humoral deficiencies usually manifest as recurrent upper and lower
respiratory tract infections due to impaired antibody production. However, most patients with
selective IgA deficiency are asymptomatic.

Educational objective:

CFTR gene mutations are the most common cause of congenital bilateral absence of the vas
deferens (CBAVD). Patients with CBAVD have azoospermia and infertility but normal levels of
FSH, LH, and testosterone. Elevated sweat chloride levels are diagnostic of cystic fibrosis.
