Aseries of experiments is being conducted to determine the structure and function of different
types of bacterial RNA. Cultures of Staphylococcus aureus are exposed to chemicals that lyse
the bacterial cells, and the RNA molecules are then extracted. A specific RNA consisting of 90
nucleotides is purified for further analysis. It is found to contain high amounts of chemically
modified bases such as dihydrouridine, pseudouridine, and ribothymidine, and its secondary
structure arises from base pairing within the chain. Which of the following is the most likely
composition of the 3'-end of this molecule?

© A. AUG

O B. CCA

©, C. Methylguanosine triphosphate
