metaphase plate, and during anaphase the homologs separate from each other with the

centromeres intact.

(Choice D) Prophase of meiosis II is unique as it does not immediately follow a period of DNA

synthesis; DNA was duplicated prior to prophase of meiosis I.

Educational objective:

Primary oocytes are completely developed in female embryos by the fifth month of gestation,
at which point they are arrested in prophase of meiosis |. Normal menstrual cycle hormones
stimulate the primary oocyte to resume differentiation. Prior to fertilization, secondary oocytes
are arrested in metaphase of meiosis II.
