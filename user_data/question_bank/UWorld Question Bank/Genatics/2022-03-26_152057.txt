Telomeres lie at the end of linear eukaryotic chromosomes and have tandem repeat DNA
sequences, usually GT-rich repeats (eg, TTAGGG). They protect chromosomes from being
recognized as damaged DNA, help to regulate gene expression, and participate in controlling
cell replication and entry into senescence. As DNA polymerase cannot fully replicate the 3°
end of the lagging chromosomal strands, cell division and aging lead to progressive DNA loss
and telomere shortening at chromosomal ends. Once cells reach their maximum limit for
proliferation (~50-70 divisions), the shortened telomeres trigger permanent growth arrest. Cell
checkpoint genes (eg, 7P53) become activated, and the critically short and dysfunctional
telomeres lead to programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Telomerase is an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase that consists of 2 molecules, human
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase RNA (TR or TERC). Telomerase
synthesizes telomeric DNA sequences that can replace the lost chromosomal ends of the
telomeres. As a result, the telomere can divide without reaching a limit. Normal human cells
have absent telomerase activity except in cells that need to divide regularly (eg, germ cells,
certain adult stem cells). However, >90% of cancer cells contain increased telomerase activity,

allowing for continued proliferation without apoptosis.
