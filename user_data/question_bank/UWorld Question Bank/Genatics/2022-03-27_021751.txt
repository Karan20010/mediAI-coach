placement of the proper amino acid in the growing polypeptide chain.

(Choice E) The D loop contains numerous dihydrouridine residues, which are modified bases
often present in tRNA. The D loop (along with the acceptor stem and anticodon loop)
facilitates correct tRNA recognition by the proper aminoacyl tRNA synthetase.

(Choice F) The 5' end of tRNA contains a terminal phosphate group that does not participate
in amino acid or MRNA binding.

Educational objective:

The 3' CCA tail of tRNA serves as the amino acid binding site. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetase is
the enzyme responsible for "loading" the appropriate amino acid to the 3' terminal hydroxyl
group of the CCA tail.
