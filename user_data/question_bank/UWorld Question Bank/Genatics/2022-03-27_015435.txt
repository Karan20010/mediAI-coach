This patient most likely has congenital coarctation of the aorta, which typically affects the
region of the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. Although traditionally classified into
preductal and postductal types, the signs and symptoms of aortic coarctation depend more on
the age at presentation, which varies according to the severity of the stenosis. Severe
coarctation usually presents in infancy with differential cyanosis affecting the lower extremities
as long as the ductus arteriosus remains patent. On ductal closure, these neonates can
develop signs of heart failure and shock. More moderate stenosis often presents in childhood
or adolescence with symptoms of lower-extremity claudication (eg, pain and cramping with
exercise), blood pressure discrepancy between the upper and lower extremities, and delayed
or diminished femoral pulses. Continuous murmurs and pulsatile intercostal collaterals can
also develop secondary to restricted circulation.

Congenital aortic coarctation occurs in up to 10% of patients with Turner syndrome (45,XO).

(Choice A) DiGeorge syndrome is associated with at least 15% of cases of interrupted aortic
arch, a more extreme anomaly than aortic coarctation in which the aortic arch is atretic or a
segment of the arch is absent. Affected patients have poor lower-extremity pulses, but
respiratory distress, variable cyanosis, and signs of congestive heart failure will also develop
during the first days of life.
