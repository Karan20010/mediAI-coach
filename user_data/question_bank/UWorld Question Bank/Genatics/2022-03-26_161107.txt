Of the available answer options, only mosaicism is consistent with a third copy of
chromosome 21 existing in at least a portion of the patient's cells.

(Choices A and E) Genomic imprinting is a normal process that refers to selective activation
of gene expression depending on the parent of origin. Aberrant imprinting occurs with
uniparental disomy, or when a person receives 2 copies of a chromosome from the same
parent and no copy from the other parent. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome
(15q) are examples of conditions caused by dysfunctional imprinting due to uniparental
disomy.

(Choice C) Many genetic syndromes are caused by deletions (loss of genetic material). Cri
du chat syndrome (5p deletion) is an example of a syndrome caused by a partial deletion of
chromosome 5.

(Choice D) Increased trinucleotide repeats (triplet expansion) on certain genes can lead to
