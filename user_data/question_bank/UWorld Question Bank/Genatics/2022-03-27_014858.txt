The results of the western blot show that the treated cell line produces less c-myc protein.
This is most likely due to RNA interference, a mechanism by which short (20-30 base pair)
double-stranded RNA sequences induce posttranscriptional gene silencing.

Silencing RNA includes both small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA). The
human genome encodes over 1000 miRNA genes, each one capable of repressing hundreds
of target genes; altered expression of miRNA genes are involved in the development of many
diseases, including hematologic and solid malignancies. In addition, synthetic sIRNA
sequences can be introduced into cells to silence specific pathogenic genes (eg, c-Myc
oncogene) and are being explored as possible therapeutic agents.

After being transcribed, miRNA undergoes processing in the nucleus to form a double-
stranded precursor that is then exported into the cytoplasm. There, the precursor is cleaved
into a short RNA helix by a ribonuclease protein called dicer. The individual strands are then
separated and incorporated into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). This multiprotein
complex uses its associated miRNA as a template to bind to complementary sequences found
on target mRNAs. An exact match generally results in mRNA degradation, but a partial
match also causes translational repression by preventing ribosome and translation factor
binding.
