(Choice C) Penetrance is the probability that a person with a given genotype will express its
associated phenotype. If all individuals with a given gene express its phenotype, that gene is

said to have complete penetrance.

(Choice D) Mosaicism refers to the presence of 2 or more cell lines, each with a unique
nuclear genome, within the same individual. While patients with combined somatic and
germline mosaicism can demonstrate disease traits and also pass the disease on to their
offspring, mosaicism would not explain the pattern of female-only transmission.

(Choice E) Uniparental disomy occurs when both members of a chromosomal pair are
inherited from one parent, which can cause problems due to genomic imprinting. For instance,
although most often due to chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy can also cause Prader-
Willi and Angelman syndromes due to loss of expression of maternal/paternal imprinted

components of a critical region of chromosome 15.

Educational objective:

The presence of lactic acidosis and ragged skeletal muscle fibers histologically suggests a
mitochondrial myopathy. Variable clinical expressions in affected family members can occur
due to heteroplasmy, which is the coexistence of distinct versions of mitochondrial genomes in

an individual cell.
