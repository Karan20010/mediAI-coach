arms of both chromosomes 14 and 21.

(Choices A, B, and D) AFP is produced in both the yolk sac and developing fetal liver; fetal
defects that disrupt the abdominal wall or neural tube allow AFP to concentrate in the amniotic
fluid, thereby raising maternal serum levels. Gastroschisis, an abdominal wall defect lateral to
the umbilicus with herniation of uncovered bowel, and myelomeningocele, a type of neural
tube defect, are two conditions associated with an elevated maternal AFP. Amniotic bands,
loose strands of amnion that constrict and disrupt developing fetal structures, can affect the
abdominal wall or neural tube development in severe cases and lead to elevated AFP levels.

(Choice C) Multiple gestation will cause all of the quadruple screen analytes to be abnormally
high due to increased fetal tissue and placental mass associated with 22 fetuses.

Educational objective:

Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal anomaly. It is associated with low levels
of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and estriol, while B-hCG and inhibin A levels are
increased. Elevated AFP levels are seen in multiple gestation, open neural tube defects, and
abdominal wall defects.
