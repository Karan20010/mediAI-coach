Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease. The patient, who is Caucasian, has a
1/30 probability of carrying the mutant CFTR allele and her husband, who is of Asian descent,
has a 1/100 probability of carrying the same allele. If a parent is a carrier, the probability that
the child will inherit the mutant allele from that parent is 1/2. However, to develop CF, the child
must independently inherit a mutant allele from each parent (1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4 probability).
Therefore:

P(affected child) = 1/4 x P(carrier mother) x P(carrier father) = 1/4 x 1/30 x 1/100 = 1/12,000.

An equivalent solution would be to state that the probability that the mother is a carrier and will
transmit the mutant allele is (1/30 x 1/2) and the probability that the father is a carrier and will
transmit the mutant allele is (1/100 x 1/2). The probability that both events will occur,
producing a child with CF, is the product of the probabilities of these independent events =
(1/30 x 1/2) x (1/100 x 1/2) = 1/12,000.

Educational objective:

The probability that a child of parents from 2 populations with different mutant allele carrier
frequencies will inherit an autosomal recessive disease is 25% multiplied by the carrier
frequencies.
