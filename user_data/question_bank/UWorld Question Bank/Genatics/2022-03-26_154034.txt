This patient most likely has a form of mitochondrial myopathy. Without properly functioning
mitochondria, cells are unable to use oxidative phosphorylation to efficiently produce adequate
levels of ATP. Organ systems such as the brain and skeletal muscle will be affected first due
to their high metabolic demand relative to other tissues. Affected patients often present with
myopathy (eg, muscle weakness, myalgia), lactic acidosis due to impaired aerobic glycolysis,
and nervous system dysfunction (eg, neuropathy, seizures). Muscle biopsy classically
shows ragged red fibers.

Mitochondria are unique organelles because they contain their own DNA, known as mtDNA.
Offspring inherit mtDNA in a maternal fashion with no paternal contribution (maternal
inheritance). Only affected females transmit abnormal mitochondria to offspring; transmission
never occurs through males (even if they are affected).

(Choice A) Autosomal dominant disorders affect 50% of all children (males and females) born
to one affected parent. The disease will appear in consecutive generations, and father-to-son
transmission can occur.

(Choice B) Autosomal recessive conditions affect about 25% of all children (males and
females) with two carrier parents. Offspring of a single affected parent will be carriers for the

disorder. As a result, the disease can skip generations, but consanquineous families will show
