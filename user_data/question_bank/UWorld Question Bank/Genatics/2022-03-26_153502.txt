DNA replication occurs during the S phase (synthesis phase) of the cell cycle and is

coordinated by the effects of multiple proteins. First, the origin of replication is identified and

bound by a multi-subunit protein (the origin recognition complex), which locally dissociates

double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). ssDNA-binding proteins

then bind to and stabilize the ssDNA, preventing it from reannealing (Choice C).

Helicase subsequently binds to ssDNA at the origin of replication, moves into the replication
fork, and proceeds to separate and unwind the dsDNA. As DNA is unwound, superhelical
tension is generated as supercoils are being formed. Topoisomerase relieves this tension by
introducing transient single- or double-stranded nicks in the DNA. This enzyme is located
ahead of helicase on the dsDNA segment of the replication fork (Choice A).

(Choice D) Before DNA polymerase can begin synthesizing DNA, it requires an RNA primer
made up of short RNA sequences base-paired to the parent DNA. This primer is synthesized
by the enzyme primase (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase).

(Choice E) DNA polymerase synthesizes new daughter strand DNA in the 5' to 3' direction.

The leading strand is formed continuously, whereas the lagging strand is formed
discontinuously, creating Okazaki fragments.

Choice F) Okazaki fragments are ultimately bound together by the enzyme ligase.
