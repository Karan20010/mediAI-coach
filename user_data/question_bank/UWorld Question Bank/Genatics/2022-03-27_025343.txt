A 26-year-old woman is being evaluated for a possible inherited disorder. She has a 6-year
history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and a year ago, she had partial loss of vision due
to an occipital infarction. Her mother has chronic intermittent muscle weakness and lactic
acidosis, and her maternal uncle has hemiplegia. Skeletal muscle biopsy of the patient shows
ragged-appearing muscle fibers. After further evaluation, all the affected family members are
found to suffer from the same inherited disease. Pedigree analysis is shown in the image
below.
