Compared to his mother, this neonate has profound symptoms of muscle weakness. These
findings suggest genetic anticipation, in which an inherited condition presents earlier and
with more severe disease in successive generations.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is myotonic dystrophy (DM), an autosomal dominant
disorder caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion:

¢ Classic (adult) DM: Muscle weakness affecting the distal extremities and face (eg,
absent facial expression, long and narrow face) is classic, as seen in this patient's mother.
Myotonia (impaired muscle relaxation) also occurs and is often described by patients as
cramping or stiffness.

With increasing repeat expansion length, DM can cause worsening symptoms in successive
generations, as seen in this infant.

¢ Congenital DM: Neonates have respiratory distress and poor feeding due to profound
muscle weakness and hypotonia. Prenatal findings of DM may include polyhydramnios
secondary to impaired swallowing from weakened pharyngeal muscles. Decreased fetal
movement can also result in flexion contractures (ie, arthrogryposis) and clubfoot.
