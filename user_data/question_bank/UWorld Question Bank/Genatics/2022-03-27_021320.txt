A healthy 31-year-old woman comes to the office as she and her husband desire a second
child. The husband is infertile and the patient's son, who was conceived via donor
insemination, was recently diagnosed with glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe disease).
This rare autosomal recessive disease is known to affect 1 in 40,000 of the general
population. Genetic testing confirms that the patient is a carrier for the disease. A different

sperm donor is selected with no personal or family history of Pompe disease; however, his
carrier status is unknown. What is the probability of the patient having an affected child with

the new sperm donor?
