A 2-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department due to progressively worsening
"floppiness" and poor feeding. The infant was born in Eastern Europe via an uncomplicated
vaginal delivery to a 38-year-old woman and then immigrated to the United States with his
family. The parents describe the infant as a "good baby" who rarely cries and sleeps through
the night but has lately been difficult to rouse for breastfeeding. Stools have also decreased to
every other day and are small and pellet-like. Physical examination shows a hypotonic infant
with a large anterior fontanelle, large tongue, and a reducible umbilical hernia. He has low
tone and is unable to hold his head erect on his own. No other abnormalities are seen. Which
of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's condition?
