Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive hemoglobinopathy. Affected patients must
inherit 2 mutant genes for hemoglobin S (HbS), one from each parent. In order for an offspring
of 2 parents without sickle cell anemia to be affected, both parents must carry the sickle
cell trait. Any offspring resulting from such pairings will have a 1 in 4 chance of having sickle
cell disease (SCD). This patient is a carrier of the sickle cell trait as she has a child with sickle
cell anemia.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis, a type of gel electrophoresis, is used to determine if the
patient's new husband also has sickle cell trait. Abnormal hemoglobin (eg, HbS), moves at a
slower speed than normal hemoglobin due to the replacement of glutamic acid by valine. The
husband's test results combined with the maternal family history will determine the risk that
future offspring will inherit sickle cell anemia.

(Choice A) The chorionic villi are part of the placenta and, as such, are fetal tissue. Once
fetal DNA is obtained, DNA sequencing can be performed to evaluate for sickle cell mutation.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) can be performed at 10-14 weeks gestation. However, it is
relatively invasive and carries a risk of miscarriage, spotting/bleeding, infection, and other
complications. CVS is not helpful to a patient who wishes to determine her risk prior to

conception.
