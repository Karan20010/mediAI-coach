(Choice E) Cri du chat is most commonly due to a de novo partial deletion of the short arm of
chromosome 5 (5p-). Patients with cri du chat syndrome typically have a round face, catlike
cry, and microcephaly.

(Choice F) Down syndrome (DS) results from meiotic nondisjunction or Robertsonian
translocation involving fetal chromosome 21. These patients have a flat face, oblique
palpebral fissures, and epicanthal folds. Atrioventricular defects are the most common cardiac
anomaly. Although cystic hygromas can occur in patients with DS, the absence of the
dysmorphic features of DS makes this diagnosis unlikely.

Educational objective:

Turner syndrome (45,X) manifests in the neonate with lymphedema and cystic hygromas.
Short stature, primary amenorrhea, and aortic anomalies are the other important clinical
features.
