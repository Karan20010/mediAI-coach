Following transcription, pre-mRNA is the initial transcript that contains both intron and exon
sequences. Before leaving the nucleus, pre-mRNA must be processed to mature MRNA by 3
post-transcriptional modifications: 5' methylguanosine capping, addition of a 3' polyadenine
(Poly A) tail, and splicing.

Splicing is performed by spliceosomes, which are complexes of small nuclear
ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and other proteins that assemble on pre-mRNA. Spliceosomes
remove introns containing GU at the 5" splice site and AG at the 3" splice site. Initially, the
5' end of intron 1 (splice donor site) is cleaved and joined to the branch point. The freed 3'-OH
of exon 1 then forms a phosphodiester bond with the 5'-phosphate at the splice acceptor site,
joining exons 1 and 2. Mutations at splice sites may result in inappropriate removal of exons
and retention of introns. This often leads to the formation of proteins with impaired structure
and function as described in the case above.

(Choice A) Polyadenylation of the 3' end of mRNA is performed by the enzyme polyadenylate

polymerase. This process stabilizes mRNA and helps it exit the nucleus.

(Choices B and D) In eukaryotes, translation is initiated when the small ribosomal subunit
attaches to the 5' cap of MRNA and then scans for the AUG start codon within the Kozak
consensus sequence. The 5' cap also protects against exonucleases and helps stabilize
