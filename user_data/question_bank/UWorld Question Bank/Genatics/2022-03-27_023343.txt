This patient has fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited cause of intellectual
disability. Physical findings include macroorchidism and dysmorphic facies (eg, long and
narrow face, prominent forehead and chin). Neuropsychiatric disorders include
developmental delay, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). This patient's delayed language acquisition and poor social skills are suggestive of
ASD.

FXS is caused by a mutation of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR7) gene on the long
arm of the X chromosome. FMR7 normally has 5 to 55 CGG trinucleotide repeats and can
potentially expand during meiosis in oocytes. "Full mutation" is characterized by >200 CGG
trinucleotide repeats, which causes FMR7 hypermethylation. DNA methylation inactivates
FMR, preventing transcription and production of fragile X mental retardation protein, thereby
impairing neural development. Southern blot analysis is used to measure the degree of
methylation and determine the number of CGG repeats.

(Choices A and C) Exons ("expressed codons") are protein coding regions of DNA. Introns
are removed during intranuclear mRNA processing and not expressed in the final MRNA
sequence. Abnormalities involving mRNA splicing do not play a role in FXS pathogenesis.

(Choice D) Imprinting refers to gene expression from only one parental allele, rather than
