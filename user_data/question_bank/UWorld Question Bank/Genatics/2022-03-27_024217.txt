microscopy of the affected muscle reveals an increased number of enlarged, abnormally

shaped mitochondria.

The most important mitochondrial myopathies are myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers
(MERRF, described in this vignette), Leber optic neuropathy (blindness), and mitochondrial
encephalopathy with stroke-like episodes and lactic acidosis (MELAS). Each of these
diseases is the result of a mitochondrial gene mutation.

The mitochondrial diseases are caused by mutations, deletions or duplications of mtDNA.
Because sperm mitochondria do not pass into the ovum during fertilization, only maternal
mitochondria are transmitted to the fetus. Mitochondrial diseases, therefore, have maternal
inheritance. For this reason the male patient described in this vignette will not transmit the
disease to his progeny.

+ 6 Blotchy red muscle fibers on Gomori trichrome stain are characteristic of the mitochondrial
3 myopathies. In these conditions, abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma of
- 9 muscle fibers. The fibers have an irregular shape and size on cross section. For this reason,
the mitochondrial myopathies are also known as the "red ragged fiber" diseases. Electron
