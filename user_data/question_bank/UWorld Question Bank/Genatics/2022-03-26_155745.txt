Intellectual disability, gait or posture abnormality, eczema, and a musty body odor are signs of

phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of the
gene that codes for phenylalanine hydroxylase. In the United States, phenylalanine levels are
measured in all neonates to screen for PKU.

Because PKU is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, both of the healthy parents must
be heterozygous carriers of the mutation. The probability that their next child will inherit the
disease is:

p; = probability that the mother transmits the mutant allele = 1/2

p. = probability that the father transmits the mutant allele = 1/2

The probability that a child will inherit a mutant allele from each carrier parent is equal to p, x p,

= 1/4, as these are independent events.

Educational objective:

Intellectual disability, gait or posture abnormality, eczema, and a musty body odor in a toddler

are signs of phenylketonuria (PKU). Most infants with PKU are born to 2 heterozygous carrier

parents. The probability that heterozygous carrier parents will transmit an autosomal

recessive disease such as PKU to a child is 1/4. AGiVEKE Winelons
