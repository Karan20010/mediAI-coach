Inheritance of Down syndrome

Mechanism

Pathogenesis

Recurrence risk

Meiotic
nondisjunction
(~95%)

Extra copy of chromosome 21
present in every cell

Based on maternal age

Unbalanced
translocation

All or part of additional chromosome
21 attached to another
chromosome

High if balanced
translocation is present in
one parent

Mosaicism

Some (not all) cells have an extra
copy of chromosome 21
Nondisjunction event in early

embryonic life

Similar to normal
population
