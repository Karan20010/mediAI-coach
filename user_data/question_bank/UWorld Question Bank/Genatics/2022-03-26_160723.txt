This patient has dyskeratosis congenita; a genetic disorder involving a mutation in the genes

related to telomere maintenance (eg, telomerase reverse transcriptase) that results in short

telomeres. Telomeres are a complex of protein (eg, shelterin) and DNA repeats (eg,

TTAGGG) at the ends of chromosomes that prevent chromosomal degradation and fusion

with neighboring chromosomes. With each cellular division telomeres progressively shorten,

eventually reaching a critical length at which apoptosis or senescence is triggered.

In cells with a high turnover rate (eg, epithelial cells, lymphocytes, hematopoietic stem cells),
telomere length is maintained by telomerase. This complex, composed of an RNA template
and a reverse transcriptase, adds DNA repeats to the end of telomeres as they are lost with
cell division. Without normal telomerase activity, rapidly dividing cells cannot maintain
chromosomal integrity, triggering premature cell death. In patients with short telomere
disorders, loss of these cells can cause characteristic mucocutaneous changes (eg, oral
leukoplakia, dystrophic nails), bone marrow failure (eg, pancytopenia), and pulmonary
fibrosis (due to alveolar epithelial dysfunction).

(Choices A, B, C, and F) Telomerase is inactivated in long-lived, differentiated cells such as
cardiac myocytes, CNS neurons, compact bone osteocytes, and vascular endothelial cells;
therefore, these cells are not likely to be affected by this patient's mutation. However, in
