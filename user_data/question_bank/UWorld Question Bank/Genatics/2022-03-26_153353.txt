females equally. It causes progressive neurodegeneration of the caudate and putamen,
leading to chorea, dementia, and death. Patients usually have an affected parent.

all offspring of an affected mother; there is no father-child transmission. It is characterized by
progressive bilateral optic neuropathy leading to blindness.

(Choice E) Rett syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder affecting females (affected males
die in utero) that presents in early childhood with progressive neurodegeneration and
stereotypical hand movements. X-linked dominant conditions are characterized by a lack of
father-son transmission whereas all daughters of an affected father are affected. Half of all
offspring of an affected mother are also affected.
