A 5-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that her
daughter "sunburns too easily." The mother says the patient's skin becomes red and scaly
with only minimal sun exposure. She first noticed the problem when her daughter was 7
months old during a trip to the beach. The mother has since avoided exposing her child to
excess sunlight, but finds it difficult now that the patient has begun kindergarten. Physical

examination shows thin and hyperpigmented skin. She also has a few nevi on her hands that
have been enlarging rapidly. This patient's disorder is most likely due to a primary defect
involving which of the following processes?

A. DNA mismatch repair (10%)

B. Nucleotide excision repair (71%)
C. Ras signal transduction (1%)

D. Regulation of apoptosis (1%)

E. Regulation of cell cycle (1%)

F. Repair of DNA crosslinks (13%)
