This patient has a prenatally identified cleft lip and palate with no known family history of the
condition. Most cases are multifactorial and related to a combination of multiple interacting
genetic and environmental factors.

Cleft lip results when the maxillary prominence fails to fuse with the intermaxillary segment
during the fifth or sixth week of embryonic development. Cleft palate occurs when the palatine
shelves fail to fuse with each other or with the primary palate. Cleft lip and palate can occur
together or in isolation. Because of the complexity of embryologic development, many genetic
abnormalities (eg, genes controlling cell differentiation, communication, and migration) can
lead to failure of this fusion. Environmental risk factors have also been identified (eg,
antiepileptic drugs, maternal smoking, folate deficiency) that increase the risk of cleft lip and
palate in genetically susceptible individuals.

Genetic syndromes (with multiple inheritance patterns) are responsible for approximately
30%-50% of cleft palate cases (eg, 22q11 deletion syndrome).
(Choice A) Autosomal recessive inheritance can be responsible for some forms of syndromic

cleft lip and palate, which can lead to index cases with no family history. However, most cases
are caused by multifactorial inheritance, particularly in the absence of other findings consistent

with a genetic syndrome.
