Patau syndrome, or trisomy 13, is a severe genetic disorder with phenotypic features
reflecting a defect in the fusion of the prechordal mesoderm, an integral embryological
structure affecting growth of the midface, eyes, and forebrain. This results in catastrophic
midline defects, including holoprosencephaly, microcephaly, microphthalmia, cleft lip/palate,
and omphalocele. Abnormal brain development results in intellectual disability and seizures.
Additional abnormalities include polydactyly and cutis aplasia (focal skin defect of the
scalp). The majority of patients with Patau syndrome die in utero; only 5% survive beyond 6
months.

Cytogenetic studies usually demonstrate meiotic nondisjunction, which is the failure of
chromosomal separation during meiosis, causing inheritance of a chromosome pair from 1
parent rather than a single chromatid. Maternal age >35 is an important risk factor for this
abnormality of oocyte division. Nondisjunction results in a fetus with 3 complete copies of
chromosome 13 (47, XX, +13).

(Choice A) Patients with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) typically have a flat facial profile,
upslanting palpebral fissures, low-set small ears, redundant skin at the nape of the neck,
single transverse palmar crease, and hypotonia. Increased rates of duodenal atresia and

Hirschsprung disease are seen in these patients. ctivate V
