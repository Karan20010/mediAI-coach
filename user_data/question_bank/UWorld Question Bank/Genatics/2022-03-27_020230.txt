After transcription, the preliminary, unprocessed mRNA is known as precursor MRNA, or
heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). Eukaryotic pre-mRNA undergoes significant
posttranscriptional processing before leaving the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail
addition, and intron splicing.

Once mRNA is finalized, it leaves the nucleus bound to specific packaging proteins. Upon
entering the cytoplasm, these mRNA complexes often associate with ribosomes to undergo
translation. However, certain mRNA sequences instead associate with proteins that are found
in P bodies. P bodies are distinct foci found within eukaryotic cells that are involved in mRNA
regulation and turnover. They play a fundamental role in translation repression and mRNA
decay, and contain numerous proteins including RNA exonucleases, mRNA decapping
enzymes, and constituents involved in mRNA quality control and microRNA-induced mRNA
silencing. P bodies also seem to function as a form of MRNA storage, as certain mRNAs are
incorporated into P bodies only to be later released and utilized for protein translation.

(Choices A and B) The 5' end of all mRNA is capped with a 7-methylguanosine residue by a
unique 5' to 5' linkage, which occurs in two stages. The first step is the addition of guanine
triphosphate to the 5' end of mRNA in a reaction catalyzed by guanylyltransferase.
Methylation of the guanosine cap is then catalyzed by guanine-7-methyltransferase. Capping
