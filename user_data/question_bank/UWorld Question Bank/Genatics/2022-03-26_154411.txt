Synthesis of the daughter strands occurs simultaneously from both parent strands. Because
DNA synthesis can occur only in the 5'—3' direction, one daughter strand is synthesized
continuously toward the replication fork (leading strand). However, the other strand must be
synthesized discontinuously in a direction away from the replication fork (lagging strand),
with more and more segments being added as the replication fork moves across the DNA
double helix. This results in the formation of Okazaki fragments, short stretches of newly
synthesized DNA that are separated by RNA primers. These primers are removed and
replaced with DNA, and the Okazaki fragments are subsequently joined together by DNA
ligase. Because of the discontinuous nature of DNA synthesis on the lagging strand, DNA
ligase acts many more times on the lagging strand than on the leading strand.

(Choice D) DNA polymerases | and III have proofreading ability (ie, 3'+5' exonuclease
activity), and the proofreading function of these polymerases is not restricted to either the
leading or lagging strand.

(Choice E) Topoisomerase II produces negative supercoiling in the DNA helix ahead of the
replication fork to reduce the strain produced by unwinding, which causes positive
supercoiling.
