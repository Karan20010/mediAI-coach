This patient's posterior neck mass is most likely a cystic hygroma, and the bilateral extremity
swelling is consistent with lymphedema. These findings in the context of diminished femoral
pulses (suggestive of coarctation of the aorta) in a newborn girl are classic for Turner
syndrome. Turner syndrome is characterized by a 45,X karyotype due to loss of paternal
chromosome X. Both cystic hygromas and lymphedema occur due to abnormalities of
lymphatic outflow in Turner syndrome. The swelling decreases with age.

(Choice A) In congenital adrenal hyperplasia (adrenogenital syndrome), patients have
abnormal sexual differentiation due to defective hormone synthesis in the adrenal glands. The
most common enzymatic defect is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. At birth, patients have
ambiguous genitalia (girls only) and salt wasting (hypotension, hyponatremia).

(Choice B) Androgen insensitivity syndrome results from a defect in testosterone receptors.
The typical presentation is a 46,XY adolescent who appears phenotypically female but has
primary amenorrhea due to the absence of an internal female reproductive tract and the
presence of cryptorchid testes.

(Choice D) Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome) is usually caused by meiotic nondisjunction.
These patients have multiple anomalies, including cardiac defects, clenched fists, rocker

bottom feet, omphalocele, and low-set ears.
