Organisms that ferment lactose appear pink on MacConkey agar whereas lactose non-
fermenters form white colonies. In this case, the single nucleotide deletion within the lac
operon DNA sequence of the newer isolates impairs lactose metabolism most likely by
preventing the formation of a required enzyme. Because the mutation is a single base
deletion, it will cause a frameshift mutation if it occurs within the coding region (exons) of the
gene.

Frameshift mutations are caused by deletion or insertion of any number of nucleotides that
are not multiples of 3. The result is a change in the reading frame during protein translation,
which causes the production of an entirely different protein that is often shorter than the
original due to formation of a premature stop codon.

The other mutations listed are all examples of point mutations (ie, single base substitutions)
that can lead to a variety of changes in the coded protein.

(Choices A and C) Missense mutations are single base substitutions that result in the
placement of an incorrect amino acid in a protein sequence. These mutations occur within the
coding region of a gene and do not alter protein length. A conservative mutation is a type of
missense mutation where an amino acid is replaced with another that has similar biochemical
characteristics. Conservative mutations generally preserve protein function unless the
