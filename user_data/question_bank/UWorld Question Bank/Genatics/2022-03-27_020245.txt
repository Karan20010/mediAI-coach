of the precursor RNA occurs in the nucleus as the RNA is being transcribed. This methylated
cap protects mRNA from degradation by cellular exonucleases, and allows it to exit the
nucleus.

(Choice C) mRNAis polyadenylated at the 3' end by the polyadenylate polymerase complex,
which recognizes a specific sequence (AAUAAA), cleaves the pre-mRNA molecule a few
residues downstream from this sequence, and then adds a stretch of 20 - 250 adenine
residues called the poly A tail. The addition of the poly A tail occurs before the mRNA exits the
nucleus. In the cytosol, the poly A tail is gradually shortened, eventually leading to MRNA
degradation.

(Choices D and E) Since pre-mRNA contains both introns and exons, and only exons code
for proteins, introns must be excised before translation through a process known as splicing.
Splicing of pre-mRNA occurs within the nucleus and is facilitated by the interaction of pre-
mRNA with small ribonucleoprotein particles called snRNPs (or "snurps" for short).

Educational objective:

When mRNA is first transcribed from DNA, it is in an unprocessed form called pre-mRNA or

heterogeneous nuclear MRNA (hnRNA). Several processing steps are required before

finalized mRNA molecules can leave the nucleus, including 5'-capping, poly A tail addition, and Activate \
