Mutations affecting the signal sequence would be found after the start codon (AU

(Choice C) Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an RNA enzyme
("ribozyme") that resides in the large ribosomal subunit. A defect in rRNA coding for ribosomes
would interfere with this process.

(Choice D) During polypeptide elongation, the ribosome moves 3 nucleotides toward the 3"
end of mRNA, advancing peptidyl tRNA from the A site to the P site (translocation).
Translocation is catalyzed by elongation factor 2 and requires GTP hydrolysis.

(Choice E) Termination of polypeptide synthesis occurs at stop codons. Mutations in stop
codons (nonstop mutations) can result in continued and inappropriate translation of MRNA into
the 3'-untranslated region, producing an excessively long, nonfunctional polypeptide.

Educational objective:
The Kozak consensus sequence occurs on eukaryotic mRNA and helps initiate protein
translation by identifying the proper methionine start codon (AUG).
