Educational objective:
DNA replication occurs in the 5'â€”3' direction on both strands. In contrast to the continuous

synthesis of the leading strand, lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously and is
composed of short stretches of RNA primer plus newly synthesized DNA segments (Okazaki
fragments). As a result, lagging strand synthesis requires the repetitive action of DNA primase

and DNA ligase.
