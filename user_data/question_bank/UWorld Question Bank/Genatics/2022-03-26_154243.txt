A genetic researcher is comparing the DNA replication process of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells. In an experiment, Escherichia coli and human cells are cultured in separate media
containing tagged nucleotides and their rates of DNA replication are determined. Although the
eukaryotic genome is significantly larger and more complex than that of the prokaryote,
eukaryotic DNA replication still occurs in a timely manner. Which of the following features of
eukaryotic replication best explains this observation?

() A. Continuous synthesis of the lagging strand
©) B. Energy-independent DNA unwinding

©) C. Multiple origins of replication

©) D. No proofreading of daughter strands

©) E. No requirement for RNA primers
