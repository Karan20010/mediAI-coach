12 (Choice A) During DNA replication, positive supercoiling occurs in the region ahead of the
replication fork and must be removed for DNA replication to proceed. Topoisomerases reduce
15 DNA supercoiling by nicking the DNA strands, introducing negative coiling, and religating the
strands.

(Choice B) Double-strand DNA breakage can occur following exposure to ionizing radiation.
+ 20 Compared to single-strand breakage, double-stranded breaks are more prone to result in
faulty repair, leading to mutations, malignancy, or cell death.

23 (Choice D) Repair of mismatched bases occurs throughout the genome during DNA
. replication. Impaired mismatch repair is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal
26 cancer.

7 28 Educational objective:
: = X-inactivation occurs in genetically normal females and results in conversion of the inactivated
ot X chromosome into compact heterochromatin (Barr body). Heterochromatin is condensed
2 chromatin composed of heavily methylated DNA in tight association with deacetylated
7 4 histones. It has a low level of transcriptional activity. In contrast, euchromatin is loosely
: = arranged and exhibits a high level of transcriptional activity.
