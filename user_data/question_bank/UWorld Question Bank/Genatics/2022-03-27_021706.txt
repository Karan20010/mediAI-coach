5 (Choice E) Initiation of gene transcription is governed by the binding of transcription factors to

: the regulatory region of the gene. Transcription factor Il D binds to the TATA promoter

8 sequence located ~25 bases upstream from the coding region of the gene.

10 (Choice F) During protein synthesis, uncharged tRNA (lacking an amino acid) does not
interact with MRNA and ribosomes.

Educational objective:

15 Releasing factors recognize stop codons (eg, UAA, UAG, and UGA) and terminate protein
: synthesis. They facilitate release of the polypeptide chain from the ribosome and dissolution
18 of the ribosome-mRNA complex.
