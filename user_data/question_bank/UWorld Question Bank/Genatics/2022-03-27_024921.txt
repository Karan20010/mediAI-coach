Klinefelter syndrome is most commonly caused by a meiotic nondisjunction event during
parental gametogenesis that results in a 47,XXY karyotype. Variants include 46,XY/47,XXY
mosaicism and 48,XXXY. In general, patients with higher numbers of X chromosomes are
more likely to have more severe manifestations. The disorder is usually not diagnosed until
puberty when the characteristic physical signs begin to develop. The major features are as
follows:

1. Klinefelter syndrome causes primary testicular failure due to hyalinization and fibrosis of
the seminiferous tubules. This results in small, firm testes and azoospermia (infertility).
Leydig cell dysfunction also occurs and leads to testosterone deficiency. Gonadotropin
(FSH, LH) levels are increased secondary to gonadal failure.

2. Testosterone deficiency results in development of a eunuchoid body habitus. Patients
have tall stature and gynecomastia. Facial and body hair is sparse or absent and muscle
mass is decreased.

3. Mild intellectual disability is seen in some patients, although the majority have normal
intelligence. Psychosocial abnormalities (eg, lack of insight, poor judgment) are also
common.
