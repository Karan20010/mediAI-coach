(Choice A) Aminoacyl-tRNA is tRNA charged with its amino acid. The cloverleaf structure of
tRNA consists of a 3' CCA tail (amino acid binding site); a T loop abundant in ribothymidine,
pseudouridine, and cytidine residues; a D loop rich in dihydrouridine residues; and an
anticodon loop.

(Choice C) DNA promoter regions help initiate transcription by binding transcription factors
and RNA polymerase II. Promoter regions contain consensus sequences that are typically AT-
rich (eg, TATA and CAAT boxes) or GC-rich (eg, GC box).

(Choice D) Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is a component of the ribosome that catalyzes peptide
bond formation during translation.

(Choice F) Telomeres are located at the ends of chromosomes and contain TTAGGG repeats,
which are added by the enzyme telomerase (RNA-dependent DNA polymerase). Critical
shortening in telomere length is thought to signal programmed cell death.

Educational objective:

The poly-A tail is not transcribed from DNA; instead, it is added as a post-transcriptional
modification downstream of the consensus sequence (AAUAAA) located near the 3' end of the
mRNA molecule. This tail protects mRNA from degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits
