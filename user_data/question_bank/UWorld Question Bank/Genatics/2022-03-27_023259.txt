This patient most likely has cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disease characterized
by recurrent sinopulmonary infections, pancreatic insufficiency, and malabsorption. It is
caused by several different mutations that affect the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR) gene.

The most common CFTR gene mutation (found in approximately 70% of cases) is a 3-base
pair deletion of phenylalanine at amino acid position 508 (AF508). This mutation causes
impaired post-translational processing (eg, improper folding and glycosylation) of CFTR,
which is detected by the endoplasmic reticulum. As a result, the abnormal protein is targeted
for proteasomal degradation, preventing it from reaching the cell surface. Certain drugs (eg,
lumacaftor) can partially correct this folding defect, leading to expression of functional CFTR.
(Choice B) Decreased production of functionally normal CFTR (eg, reduced messenger RNA
or protein stability) often causes a milder form of the disease with normal sweat chloride levels
that may not be diagnosed until adulthood.

(Choice C) Mutations affecting regulation of chloride ion conduction through a CFTR protein
also result in CF. However, they result in decreased chloride conductivity and are less

common than the AF508 mutation.
