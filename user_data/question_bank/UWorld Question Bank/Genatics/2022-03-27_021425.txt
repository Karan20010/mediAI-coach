karyotypes evident on analysis likely has mosaic Turner syndrome. Mosaicism is defined as

the presence of multiple, genetically different cell lines within the body. It can result from

several processes, including chromosomal nondisjunction and mutations during the first stages

of embryonic development. The earlier the error happens, the more daughter cells are

affected.

Mosaicism can be classified as germline, somatic, or both:

¢ Somatic mosaicism affects the cells forming the body, causing disease manifestations
to develop in affected individuals. 45,X/46,XX is the most commonly diagnosed
mosaicism affecting sex chromosomes. These patients typically have a milder form of
Turner syndrome or can be asymptomatic, depending on the ratio of abnormal to normal
cells.

¢ Germline mosaicism affects the cells that give rise to gametes, allowing the affected
genes to pass to the offspring. The chance of a child being affected depends on the
proportion of gametes that carry the mutation. When mosaicism is limited to the germline,
the affected parent does not develop clinical manifestations.

(Choice A) Chromosomal deletions can be either macro or micro, depending on how many
