Multifactorial inheritance is a term used to describe a complex process by which numerous
genetic and environmental factors interact to determine phenotypic expression. Unlike single-
gene disorders, diseases displaying multifactorial inheritance make precise genetic analysis
and counseling extremely challenging due to their intricate development process. What is
understood about these diseases is that the closer a relative is to the affected person, the
more likely the relative is to develop the trait.

Spina bifida is an example of a multifactorial condition. There are a multitude of different
genes that play a role in neurulation, the process responsible for formation of the neural tube.
In addition to genetic factors, a number of environmental factors have profound effects on
neural tube development; the most well known is dietary folate deficiency. Neural tube defects
are more common in first-degree relatives of those affected, with a recurrence risk of 2%-5%.
In general, most multifactorial conditions have a lower recurrence risk than autosomal
dominant and autosomal recessive diseases, which convey a 50% and 25% risk to first-degree
family members, respectively.

Other examples of multifactorial diseases include cleft lip and palate, diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, and hypertension.
