Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome, is the most commonly diagnosed chromosomal
anomaly in liveborn neonates. Typical symptoms include intellectual disability, congenital
abnormalities (eg, gastrointestinal, cardiac), physical growth delay, and characteristic facial
features (eg, flat facies, protruding tongue, epicanthic folds, oblique palpebral fissures). Many
patients with trisomy 21 develop early-onset Alzheimer disease (AD), defined as diagnosis
of AD age <65, with some developing AD as early as the fourth decade of life.

Characteristic pathologic changes associated with AD involve accumulation of intracellular
neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid-beta plaques:

¢ Neurofibrillary tangles are composed of tau protein, a primary component of intracellular
microtubules. In AD, tau protein is hyperphosphorylated, causing microtubule structures to
collapse into "tangles" that contribute to global neuronal dysfunction.

¢ Amyloid beta is an abnormal fragment of amyloid precursor protein, which is normally
involved in synaptic formation and repair. In AD, the protein is not properly cleared and
forms amyloid fragments; these then harden into insoluble plaques that accumulate in

brain tissue and vessel walls.

The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene is located on chromosome 21. The extra copy of

APP present in trisomy 21 is thought to accelerate amyloid accumulation and lead to early-
