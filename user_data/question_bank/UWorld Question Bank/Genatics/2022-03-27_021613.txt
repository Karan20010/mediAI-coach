(Choice C) 47,XXX is the most common sex chromosome abnormality in females. It is
usually diagnosed incidentally during genetic testing as the carriers of this genotype are
typically normal.

(Choice D) Klinefelter syndrome is associated with the 47,XXY karyotype and is associated
with primary hypogonadism in males. It is likely due to nondisjunction of the sex
chromosomes during meiotic division of the gamete of either parent.

(Choices E and F) Partial hydatidiform moles have 69,XXX or 69,XXY karyotype as the result
of fertilization of an ovum by 2 sperm. Partial moles typically contain fetal tissue and normal
placental villi intermixed with hydropic villi.

Educational objective:

A complete hydatidiform mole usually results when an empty ovum is fertilized by a haploid
sperm. Subsequent duplication of the paternal genetic complement (23X) results in the
characteristic 46,XX genotype.
