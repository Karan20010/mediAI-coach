(Choice D) Microdeletion syndrome due to genomic imprinting includes Prader-Willi
syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS). In PWS, paternal genes are deleted (15q-)
and maternal genes are silenced, resulting in short stature, obesity, hypotonia, and
hypogonadism. In AS, maternal genes are deleted (15q-) and paternal genes are silenced.
Patients have microcephaly, ataxia, hand flapping movements, and frequent laughter ("happy
puppet’).

(Choice E) Tuberous sclerosis involves defective tumor suppressor gene-coded proteins
hamartin (TSC7) and tuberin (TSC2), and is characterized by cutaneous angiofibromas, brain
hamartomas, and cardiac rhabdomyomas.

(Choice F) Friedrich ataxia (GAA repeat) is characterized by spinocerebellar degeneration
and spinal ataxia. It is not associated with facial or palatal malformations. Other examples of
trinucleotide repeats include Fragile X (CGG) and myotonic dystrophy (CTG).

Educational objective:

Chromosome 22q11.2 microdeletion results in DiGeorge syndrome (cardiac anomalies,
hypoplastic or absent thymus, and hypocalcemia) and velocardiofacial syndrome (cleft palate,
cardiac anomalies, dysmorphic facies). Fluorescence in situ hybridization is the "gold

standard" for detecting a microdeletion. Activate V
