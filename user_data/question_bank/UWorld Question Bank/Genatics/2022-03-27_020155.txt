There are 61 codons that code for amino acids, but only 20 amino acids are used in protein
synthesis. The genetic code is therefore considered "degenerate" because more than 1
codon can code for a particular amino acid. For instance, the codons CUC and CUU both
code for the amino acid leucine.

Individual tRNA molecules are specific for certain amino acids and recognize the mRNA
codons associated with those amino acids. Certain tRNA molecules can recognize multiple
different codons coding for the same amino acid, a phenomenon explained by the wobble
hypothesis. This hypothesis states that the first 2 nucleotide positions on the mRNA codon
require traditional (Watson-Crick) base pairing with their complementary nucleotides on tRNA,
whereas the third "wobble" nucleotide position may undergo less stringent (nontraditional)
base pairing. In the case of leucine, for example, 1 tRNA molecule recognizes 2 codons (CUC
and CUU) because only the first 2 nucleotide positions (CU in the codon) form traditional
bonds.

(Choice A) The genetic code is not ambiguous as each codon is associated with only a single
amino acid.

(Choice B) The genetic code is read sequentially from a starting point and has no internal
punctuation as each codon is adjacent to the next without spacer nucleotides in between.
