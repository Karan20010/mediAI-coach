Ouword
This patient with chronic microcytic anemia requiring blood transfusions and a predominance
of hemoglobins F and A2 on hemoglobin electrophoresis likely has beta-thalassemia, a
hereditary blood disorder characterized by reduced B-globin chain production.

The base sequence indicated by the bold red arrow in this patient's B-globin gene represents
the CAAT box, a highly conserved (consensus) sequence that functions as a promoter of
transcription in the eukaryotic genome. It is typically located 70-80 bases upstream from the
transcription start site. The Hogness (TATA) box is a second promoter region in the eukaryotic
genome and is seen just to the right of the CAAT box in the above image. The TATA box is
generally located 25 bases upstream from the transcription start site. Both the CAAT box and
the TATA box promote initiation of transcription by acting as binding sites for general
transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.

(Choice A) Enhancer sequences bind activator proteins that facilitate bending of DNA. DNA
bending allows activator proteins to interact with general transcription factors and RNA
polymerase II at the promoter, increasing the rate of transcription. Enhancers can be located
upstream or downstream from the gene being transcribed and may be near the gene or
thousands of base pairs away.
