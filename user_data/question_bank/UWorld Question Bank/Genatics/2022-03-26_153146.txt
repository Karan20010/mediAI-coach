(Choice D) Before DNA replication begins, helicase unwinds the DNA double helix, facilitating
separation of the 2 DNA strands by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins.

(Choice E) Okazaki fragments of the lagging strand are bound together by the enzyme ligase.

(Choice F) DNA polymerases cannot begin synthesizing complementary DNA on a single-
stranded template without an RNA primer. Primase is an RNA polymerase that synthesizes
this primer, which is made up of short stretches of RNA base paired to the DNA template.

Educational objective:

In prokaryotes, DNA polymerase | has 5' to 3' exonuclease activity in addition to 5' to 3'
polymerase and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities. This 5' to 3' exonuclease activity functions to
remove the RNA primer created by RNA primase and repair damaged DNA sequences.
