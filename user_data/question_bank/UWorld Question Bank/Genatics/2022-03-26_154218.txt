This patient presenting with involuntary movements, depression, and a family history of a
movement disorder likely has Huntington disease (HD), which typically manifests with the
triad of movement disorder (chorea), behavioral abnormalities (aggressiveness, apathy, or
depression), and dementia. HD is caused by an expansion of cytosine-adenine-guanine
(CAG) trinucleotide repeats. Most patients develop symptoms in their 40s or 50s, but an
earlier age of onset and more severe symptoms are associated with a larger number of
trinucleotide repeats.

During spermatogenesis, CAG repeats in the abnormal HTT gene (chromosome 4p) can
rapidly increase (much more than during oogenesis). Therefore, patients who receive an
abnormal gene from their fathers tend to develop the disease earlier in life. The tendency for
clinical symptoms to worsen and/or occur earlier in subsequent generations is called
anticipation. Anticipation is common in disorders associated with trinucleotide repeats, as in
Fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, and Friedreich ataxia.

(Choice B) Genomic imprinting is a selective inactivation of the genes of either maternal or
paternal origin. It results in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, which involve deletions of
the same region on chromosome (15q) but have very different clinical manifestations due to
the differential expression of parental genes. When the chromosome with the deleted region
