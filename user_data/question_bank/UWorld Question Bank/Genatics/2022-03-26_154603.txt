Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that adds TTAGGG repeats to the 3' end of
chromosomes (telomere region). It is similar to other reverse transcriptase enzymes in that it
synthesizes single-stranded DNA using single-stranded RNA as a template (RNA-dependent
DNA polymerase). Telomerase is composed of 2 main subunits, the telomerase reverse
transcriptase (TERT) subunit and the telomerase RNA component (TERC). TERC is a "built-
in" RNA template that is repeatedly read by the TERT subunit to add TTAGGG DNA sequence
repeats to telomeres.

Stem cells have very long telomeres due to their high telomerase activity, allowing them to
proliferate indefinitely in a controlled manner. In contrast, most terminally differentiated adult
somatic cells (eg, myocardial cells, neurons, pancreatic B cells) have short telomeres as they
do not express telomerase and their telomeres shorten with every cell division (Choices C, D,
and E). Critical shortening in telomere length is thought to be a signal for programmed cell
death. In fact, syndromes of premature aging (eg, Bloom syndrome) are associated with
shortened telomeres. In contrast, cancer cells upregulate their telomerase activity, preventing
cell death by maintaining their telomere length.

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the potential to differentiate into other cell types and
can be classified as either embryonic or adult stem cells. Although embryonic stem cells are
