This patient has sickle cell disease (SCD), an autosomal recessive hematologic disorder
resulting in hemoglobin molecules that polymerize during times of hypoxic stress. SCD results
from a DNA point mutation in the coding region of the hemoglobin beta-globin chain. This
single nucleotide substitution is a missense mutation that causes a glutamic acid to valine
substitution at position 6 during protein translation. The genetic code figure shows that 2
distinct nucleotide combinations code for glutamic acid, GAG and GAA. In addition, only 2
possible single nucleotide substitutions could occur in DNA that result in glutamic acid being
replaced by valine, GAA > GTA and GAG —> GTG.

(Choices A, B, and F) Examples of missense mutations include glutamine (CAA) substitution

by valine (GTT), histidine (CAT) substitution by leucine (CTT), and valine (GTA) substitution by

glutamic acid (GAA). However, they are unrelated to SCD.

(Choice C) This substitution results in a silent mutation as both TTA and CTA code for leucine.
(Choice D) Acodon change from GAA to GUA also results in glutamic acid being replaced by
valine. However, the pyrimidine base uracil occurs only in RNA (not DNA), so it would only be
present in the mRNA transcript that codes for the beta-globin protein and not in the beta-globin

gene itself.
