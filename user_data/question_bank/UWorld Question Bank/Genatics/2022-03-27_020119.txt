thousands of base pairs away.

(Choice C) Translation is initiated in the cytoplasm when a ribosome recognizes the AUG
(methionine) start codon on a mature MRNA strand. The Kozak consensus sequence plays a
major role in initiation of the eukaryotic translation process.

(Choice D) Silencers are similar to enhancers, but they decrease transcription rates by
binding repressor proteins.

(Choice E) Eukaryotic transcription termination is not completely understood. In prokaryotes,
a palindromic code in the DNA template causes formation of a "hairpin" turn in the newly
synthesized mRNA, which facilitates detachment of RNA polymerase from the DNA template.

Educational objective:

The TATA and CAAT boxes are promoters of transcription in eukaryotic cells and are located
approximately 25 and 75 bases upstream from the transcription start site, respectively. They
promote initiation of transcription by serving as binding sites for transcription factors and RNA

polymerase Il.
