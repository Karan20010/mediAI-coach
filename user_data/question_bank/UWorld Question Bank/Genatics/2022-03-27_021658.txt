= There are 64 codons in the genetic code, the majority of which code for amino acids.

° However, because there are only 20 amino acids, most have more than one codon. For

: example, GUU, GUC, GUA, and GUG all code for valine.

: In addition, there are codons that call for initiation or termination of protein synthesis. The

20 universal start codon is AUG, which codes for methionine. UAA, UAG, and UGA are stop
codons, which do not code for amino acids or bind tRNA. Instead, when the ribosome

bs encounters a stop codon, releasing factor proteins bind to the ribosome and stimulate release
45 of the formed polypeptide chain and dissolution of the ribosome-mRNA complex.

(Choice A) Charged tRNA delivers amino acids to the protein synthesis complex. The
up anticodon on a tRNA molecule recognizes the corresponding codon on mRNA, assuring
: aa proper amino acid sequencing.
(Choice B) Elongation factors facilitate tRNA binding and the translocation steps of protein
23 synthesis.
28 (Choice D) Transcription produces a pre-mRNA molecule containing both introns and exons.

Splicing is a post-transcriptional modification in which introns are removed from pre-mRNA via
+ 28 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs).
