Common bile duct obstructions increase conjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream, leading to
jaundice and dark-colored urine; they also prevent bilirubin from entering the digestive tract,
which results in clay-colored (acholic) stools. The vast majority (>85%) of obstructing
pancreatic masses are due to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

The major genomic abnormality in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is KRAS-activating
mutation, which allows tumor cells to grow and divide without input from the cellular milieu
due to aberrant activity that relays a continuous growth signal to the nucleus. Because KRAS
mutations are one of the earliest oncogenic mutations in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, tests for
KRAS abnormalities are being developed to help with early detection. Many colorectal
cancers and non-small cell lung cancers also have KRAS-activating mutations.

(Choice A) Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor
gene are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). FAP causes innumerable
colon polyps and colon cancer. Patients typically have hematochezia.

(Choice B) BCL2 produces a protein that sits on the outer membrane of mitochondria and
controls cell survival and apoptosis. BCL2-activating mutation is common in follicular
lymphoma. Although patients with follicular lymphoma often have large abdominal masses,
almost all cases are marked by significant peripheral lymphadenopathy and B symptoms (eg,
