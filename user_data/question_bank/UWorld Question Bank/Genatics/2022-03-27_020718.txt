In the experiment described above, the poly-A tail on mature MRNA is most likely to bind the
latex beads because the adenine residues in this tail would form complementary base pairs
with the repeated deoxythymine residues fixed to the beads.

Mature mRNA refers to mRNA that has been processed and is ready for nuclear export and
translation into protein. mRNA processing (post-transcriptional modification) involves the

following steps:

1. 5' capping: A 7-methyl-guanosine cap is added to the 5' end of the mRNA.

2. Polyadenylation: A poly-A tail (chain of adenine residues) is added to most eukaryotic
mRNA molecules by poly-A polymerase. Poly-A tails are not transcribed from the DNA
template. Instead, a consensus sequence (AAUAAA) located near the 3Â° end of the
RNA molecule directs the addition of the poly-A tail. This tail protects the mRNA from
degradation within the cytoplasm after it exits the nucleus.

3. Splicing: The initial mRNA transcript (pre-mRNA) contains sequences from coding and
noncoding regions of DNA, known as exons and introns, respectively. Spliceosomes
(complexes of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins [snRNPs] and other proteins) remove
introns containing GU at the 5' splice site and AG at the 3' splice site (Choice E).
