(Choice B) No pure single-gene inherited disease shows 75% transmission. There may be
75% transmission for a disease with variable penetrance.

Individuals affected by a disease with autosomal dominant inheritance receive one copy of the
abnormal gene from one parent. The chance that an affected person will transmit the disease
to his/her child is 50% (Choice C) if the parent is heterozygous for the given disease. If the
parent is homozygous, there is a 100% chance (Choice A) of transmission.

(Choice D) Autosomal recessive diseases occur when the individual inherits two copies of the
mutated gene (one from each parent). If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that
the child will be affected.

Educational Objective:

"Red ragged" muscle fibers are seen in mitochondrial diseases. Muscle fibers have this
appearance because abnormal mitochondria accumulate under the sarcolemma.
Mitochondrial diseases show maternal inheritance.
