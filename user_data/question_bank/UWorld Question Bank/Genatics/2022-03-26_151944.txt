(heterozygous) for the mutation in order to produce affected offspring. However, the father of
the marked individual comes from outside the family and would be unlikely to carry the
mutation (the question states the mutation is rare in the general population).

(Choice C) In X-linked dominant inheritance, affected individuals have at least 1 parent (of
either sex) that is also affected. An affected male will always produce affected daughters, but
none of his sons will be affected.

(Choice E) Conditions with mitochondrial inheritance are transmitted only by females. All of
an affected female’s offspring are likely to show signs of the disease.

Educational objective:

In X-linked recessive inheritance 1) affected males will always produce unaffected sons and
carrier daughters, and 2) carrier females have a 50% chance of producing affected sons and
carrier daughters. G6PD deficiency follows this inheritance pattern and causes acute
hemolytic anemia in response to oxidant drugs.
