The key steps of DNA replication are similar in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (eg, Escherichia
coli) and are as follows:

1. Unwinding of double-stranded DNA by helicase to produce single-stranded DNA

2. Formation of a replication fork

3. Synthesis of RNA primers by the enzyme primase

4. Synthesis and concurrent proofreading of daughter DNA strands by DNA polymerases
5. Removal and replacement of RNA primers with DNA

6. Ligation of Okazaki fragments on lagging strands by the enzyme ligase

Despite the similarities of prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA replication, there are important
differences between these processes. Prokaryotes possess 3 major DNA polymerases (I, Il,
and Ill), whereas eukaryotes have 5 major DNA polymerases (a, B, y, 5, and €). The
eukaryotic genome is also much larger and more complex than the prokaryotic genome,
which can be partly explained by the abundance of noncoding DNA regions (introns) located
between coding regions (exons). In addition, prokaryotes typically have circular DNA with a
single origin of replication, whereas eukaryotes have linear DNA with multiple origins of
replication. This feature allows the eukaryotic genome to be copied in a quick and effective

manner despite its large size. Activate Windows
