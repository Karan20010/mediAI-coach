. = Alzheimer disease has a strong genetic predisposition. About 30% of patients have a family
history of the disease. According to age when symptoms begin, Alzheimer disease can be
: - classified as early or late. The following three mutation sites have been associated with early-
8 onset familial Alzheimer disease (onset <60 years old):
9
1. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21
2. Presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14
3. Presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1
Both APP and presenilin gene mutations are thought to promote the production of A B-amyloid.
Late-onset familial Alzheimer disease is associated with the €4 allele of Apolipoprotein E. The
exact mechanism of its influence is not known. It is thought that the ApoE4 protein may be
involved in the formation of senile plaques.
(Choice A) Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is associated
with a defect in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors. This defect leads to decreased
hepatic LDL uptake and severe elevation in total cholesterol and LDL levels.
(Choice B) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a familial disorder inherited as an autosomal
dominant trait. The most common mutation is of the B-myosin heavy chain.
