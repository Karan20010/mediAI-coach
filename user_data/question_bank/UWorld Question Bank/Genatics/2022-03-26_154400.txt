DNA replication is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, with DNA polymerases | and III being
the main polymerase enzymes involved in prokaryotic DNA replication. For DNA replication to
begin, DNA helicase must first unwind the DNA double helix and separate the parent strands
(Choice A). The unwound single-stranded DNA is stabilized by the binding of single-stranded
DNA-binding proteins to prevent spontaneous reannealing (Choice B).
