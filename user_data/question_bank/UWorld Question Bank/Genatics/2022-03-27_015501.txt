Educational objective:

Aortic coarctation in a child/young adult presents with lower-extremity claudication (eg, pain
and cramping with exercise), blood pressure discrepancy between the upper and lower
extremities, and delayed or diminished femoral pulses. Turner syndrome (45,XO) is
associated with coarctation of the aorta in up to 10% of cases.
