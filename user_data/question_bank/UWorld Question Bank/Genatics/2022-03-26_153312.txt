Offspring have 25% chance of being affected
©uWorld

Each of the affected individuals on this pedigree inherited the disorder from asymptomatic
carrier parents, which is consistent with a recessive inheritance pattern. Because both
males and females inherit the condition, it is an autosomal recessive disorder. Based on
this inheritance pattern, 50% of offspring will be asymptomatic carriers, 25% will be unaffected,
and 25% will express the disorder.

Classic galactosemia is the most common and most severe of the galactosemic disorders. It
is an autosomal recessive disorder leading to complete enzymatic absence of galactose-1-
phosphate uridyl transferase. Newborns present within days of birth with jaundice, vomiting,
and hepatomegaly.

In general, most enzyme deficiency conditions follow an autosomal recessive inheritance
pattern whereas diseases due to defective noncatalytic proteins follow an autosomal dominant
pattern.

(Choice B) Hemophilia B (Christmas disease) is an X-linked recessive disorder affecting

males that causes factor IX deficiency with easy bruising and bleeding (eg, hemarthrosis, oral
bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage). Affected males will have asymptomatic carrier mothers.
