This patient with hematuria and a malignant renal mass most likely has renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). RCC, particularly the clear cell subtype, is strongly associated with deletion,
nonsense, and frameshift mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene at
chromosome 3p. The majority of RCCs are sporadic and develop as single tumors; these are
typically associated with somatic mutations in the VHL gene. Germline VHL mutations also
occur and are responsible for von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, a rare, autosomal dominant
disorder characterized by clear cell renal carcinomas (often multifocal and bilateral), cerebellar
hemangioblastoma, and pheochromocytoma.

VHL encodes a protein that normally inhibits hypoxia-inducible factors; VHL mutations lead to
constitutive activation of these proteins, resulting in overexpression of multiple

angiogenic growth factors (eg, VEG-F, PDG-F) that stimulate tumor proliferation. As a
result, tumors harboring VHL mutations are highly sensitive to angiogenesis inhibitors.
(Choice A) c-MYC is an oncogene located on chromosome 8. Mutations are associated with

Burkitt lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

(Choice B) NF-17 is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17. Mutations of this

gene cause neurofibromatosis type 1.
