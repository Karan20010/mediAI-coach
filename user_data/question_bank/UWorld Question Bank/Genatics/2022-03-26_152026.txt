Base excision repair is responsible for repairing various non-bulky DNA base alterations,
including depurination, alkylation, oxidation, and deamination. Excessive consumption of
dietary nitrites can promote the deamination of cytosine, adenine, and guanine to form uracil,
hypoxanthine, and xanthine, respectively. If these abnormal bases are not removed and
replaced with the correct base, DNA mutations and carcinogenesis may result.

Base excision repair (not to be confused with nucleotide excision repair or mismatch repair)
begins with recognition of abnormal bases by specific glycosylases. These cleave the altered
DNA bases from the parent DNA molecule, leaving an empty sugar-phosphate site called an
apurinic/apyrimidinic site (AP). An endonuclease then cleaves the 5' end of the AP site before
a lyase (or phosphodiesterase) enzyme subsequently completes extraction of the AP site from
the DNA molecule by removing the remaining sugar-phosphate group. DNA polymerase then
fills the gap with the correct sugar-phosphate base, and the final nick is sealed by ligase.

Educational objective:

Base excision repair is used to correct single-base DNA defects induced spontaneously or by
exogenous chemicals. In this process, glycosylases remove the defective base, and the
corresponding empty sugar-phosphate site is cleaved and removed by the action of

endonuclease and lyase. DNA polymerase then replaces the missing nucleotide, and ligase
