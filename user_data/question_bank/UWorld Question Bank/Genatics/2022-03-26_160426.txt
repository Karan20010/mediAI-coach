Cystic fibrosis (CF) results from an autosomal recessive defect in the CF transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Although most men with CF are infertile due to
congenital absence of the vas deferens, they are not sterile and can have children via
assisted reproductive technology.

Calculating the probability that the unborn child will have CF can be done by analyzing the
above pedigree as follows:

1. Because the father is homozygous for the mutant CFTR allele, he will always transmit the
mutant allele to his offspring.

2. Because the mother has an affected sibling and neither of her parents is affected, she
most likely had 2 heterozygous carrier parents. Therefore, the mother's 4 possible
genotypes are: homozygous for the normal allele, heterozygous with her mother's mutant
allele, heterozygous with her father's mutant allele, and homozygous for the mutant allele.
However, the mother does not have CF and therefore is not homozygous for the
mutant allele. This leaves 3 possible genotypes for the mother. Two of the 3 remaining
genotypes result in her being a carrier for the mutant CFTR allele, while the last one
results in her being homozygous normal. Therefore, the mother's probability of being a

carrier equals 2/3. ctivate V
