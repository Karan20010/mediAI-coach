transmembrane protein.

(Choice B) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by prions,
which are contagious pathogens comprised of small, misfolded proteins that induce abnormal
folding of normal proteins. Aggregates of misfolded proteins are difficult to degrade and result

in apoptosis and neuronal loss.

(Choice D) Phenylketonuria results from mutations in the hepatocyte enzyme phenylalanine
hydroxylase. This enzyme is not normally transported to the cell surface.

(Choice E) Sickle cell anemia results from mutations in the B-globin gene, leading to
production of hemoglobin S, which can polymerize in states of low oxygen content.
Hemoglobin S is not a transmembrane protein.

Educational objective:

AF508 is the most common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR)
protein in patients with cystic fibrosis. This mutation leads to protein misfolding and failure of
glycosylation, followed by proteasome-mediated degradation and significantly decreased
number of transmembrane CFTR proteins.
