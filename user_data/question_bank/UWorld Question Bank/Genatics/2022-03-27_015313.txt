Turner syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition that is most commonly due to
meiotic nondisjunction during gametogenesis. The loss of one X chromosome in the sperm
or egg results in a missing X chromosome in all of the patient's cells (45,X). In other patients,
the nondisjunction event occurs during mitosis in early embryogenesis; these patients are
missing the X chromosome in only some of their cells (mosaic Turner syndrome
[45,X/46,XX]). A minority of patients have both X chromosomes, but one is structurally
abnormal and missing some genetic material (eg, X fragments, isochromosomes).

The loss of all or part of the X chromosome in Turner syndrome results in a missing SHOX
gene, which normally promotes long bone growth. Therefore, patients with this syndrome
typically have short stature. Meiotic nondisjunction is also responsible for Klinefelter
syndrome and trisomies 13, 18, and 21.

(Choice A) A balanced translocation is clinically silent as there is no excess or shortage of
genetic material. However, a parent with a balanced translocation is at risk for having a child
with an unbalanced translocation. An unbalanced trisomy 21 (in which one chromosome 14
contains the long arms of both chromosomes 14 and 21) is responsible for 3%-4% of Down
syndrome cases.

Choice B) A frameshift mutation is a genetic mutation in which a number of nucleotides not
