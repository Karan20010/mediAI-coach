(Choices A and C) Missense mutations are single base substitutions that result in the
placement of an incorrect amino acid in a protein sequence. These mutations occur within the
coding region of a gene and do not alter protein length. A conservative mutation is a type of
missense mutation where an amino acid is replaced with another that has similar biochemical
characteristics. Conservative mutations generally preserve protein function unless the
mutation occurs in a critical region (eg, active site of enzyme).

(Choice D) Nonsense mutations introduce a premature stop codon in a coding region,
resulting in the production of a truncated protein. The mutation described is not a nonsense
mutation because it was caused by a single base deletion (not a base substitution).

(Choice E) Asilent mutation is a single base substitution within a codon that does not change
the amino acid (due to codon redundancy). Silent mutations have no effect on protein
formation or function.

Educational objective:

A frameshift mutation occurs with the deletion/addition of a number of bases not divisible by 3

in the coding region of a gene. Frameshift mutations alter the reading frame of the genetic

code, dramatically changing the protein structure and often resulting in the formation of a

premature stop codon. ctivate V
