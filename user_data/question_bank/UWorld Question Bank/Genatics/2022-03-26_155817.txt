3. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).
The clinical presentation of MELAS is described in this vignette.

(Choice A) Genetic imprinting is a selective inactivation of paternal or maternal alleles. This
phenomenon explains the differences in clinical presentation between Prader-Willi and

Angelman syndromes.

(Choice C) Anticipation refers to the increase in severity of genetic disorders in subsequent
generations. Anticipation is often seen in diseases involving an increased number of
trinucleotide repeats, such as Huntington disease and Fragile X syndrome.

(Choice D) Variable expressivity refers to the differences in severity of autosomal dominant
disorders. For example, a patient with Marfan syndrome may have only tall stature, while
another patient with the same genetic defect will have tall stature, aortic root dilation, and lens
dislocation. Variable expressivity is not a feature of mitochondrial diseases.

(Choice E) Female sparing is not characteristic of mitochondrial disorders. Both males and
females are equally affected in mitochondrial disorders.

Educational Objective:
Mitochondrial diseases are characterized by exclusively-maternal inheritance. The variable
