Question Id: 805
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator
(CFTR) protein. AF508 is the most common CFTR gene mutation in patients with CF. This
deletion causes abnormal protein folding and failure of glycosylation. The CFTR protein is
then targeted for degradation by the proteasome before reaching the cell surface, causing
an almost complete absence from the apical membrane of exocrine ductal epithelial cells.
The rare CFTR proteins that do reach the cell membrane are abnormal, as the AF508
mutation also reduces channel opening.

Lumacaftor and ivacaftor are CFTR-modulating medications that can potentially help patients
with CF by restoring CFTR proteins to the membrane and also by enhancing protein function
(eg, chloride transport) at the membrane, respectively. The combination of these 2
medications in patients with homozygous AF508 mutations has been shown to improve
predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV) and decrease rates of pulmonary exacerbations.

(Choice A) Polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E (APOE) are common in patients with
Alzheimer disease (AD). The polymorphism leads to a conformational protein change that
alters lipid binding, inhibits neurite growth, and leads to accumulation of amyloid-B, a peptide
that aggregates in the brain in patients with AD. APOE is not a target of degradation or a
transmembrane protein.
