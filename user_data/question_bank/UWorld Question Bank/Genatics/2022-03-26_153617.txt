The husband's short stature and morphologic features are suggestive of achondroplasia.
Achondroplasia is the most common form of short-limbed dwarfism and is caused by a
mutation that results in constitutive activation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3
(FGFR3).

Achondroplasia occurs as a sporadic mutation (due to advanced paternal age) in 85% of
cases. However, once a mutation occurs, it can be transmitted as an autosomal dominant
trait (responsible for the remaining 15% of cases) (Choice A). Only 1 mutant copy of the
FGFR3 gene is sufficient to cause the disorder; 2 copies of the mutant gene (ie,
homozygosity) are lethal. As a result, the husband must be heterozygous for the
achondroplasia mutation.

A heterozygous parent has a 50% chance of transmitting an autosomal dominant mutation.
Therefore, the unborn child has a 50% chance of inheriting achondroplasia. Because
achondroplasia is a rare condition, the chance of the unborn child having a sporadic (de novo)
mutation does not significantly add to the 50% risk of inheriting the disease.

(Choice B) In sex-linked disorders, the responsible gene is located on a sex chromosome
(either X or or). Most sex-linked disorders are X-linked recessive (XLR). In XLR disorders,
