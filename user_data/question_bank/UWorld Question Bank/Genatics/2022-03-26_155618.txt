(Choice D) Increased telomerase activity helps promote cancer cell longevity; telomerase
activity is frequently increased in tumors, but it is not mediated by MGMT.

Educational objective:

Cancer cells alter expression of genes controlling survival and replication by histone
modification, transcription factor expression, and CpG methylation. Methylation of the CpG
region adjacent to the MGMT gene, which produces an enzyme that repairs DNA, makes
tumor cells much more susceptible to alkylating chemotherapy.
