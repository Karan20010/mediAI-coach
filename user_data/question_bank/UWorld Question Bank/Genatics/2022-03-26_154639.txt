This young boy with progressive proximal muscle weakness, calf pseudohypertrophy, Gowers
sign, and elevated creatine kinase likely has Duchenne muscular dystrophy, an X-linked
recessive disorder caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene. Although Duchenne muscular
dystrophy is most commonly caused by deletions resulting in frameshift mutations, nonsense
mutations may also occur, leading to the formation of a truncated dystrophin protein.

After messenger RNA (mRNA) is produced from DNA and posttranscriptionally modified, it is
transported to the cytoplasm for translation into protein. mRNA is composed of groups of 3
sequential nucleotide bases known as codons. These nucleotide triplets code for specific
amino acids and signal for the initiation (eg, start codon [AUG]) or termination of translation
(eg, stop codons [UAA, UAG, UGA)). In this case, a single base substitution from UCA
(serine) to UGA has introduced a premature stop codon in the middle of the protein sequence
(nonsense mutation), resulting in early termination of protein synthesis.

Dystrophin normally links with actin fibers and provides mechanical reinforcement to
glycoprotein complexes in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle cells. Consequently,
dystrophin dysfunction leads to increased breakdown of the sarcolemma, muscle fiber
degeneration, and the clinical findings described above.
