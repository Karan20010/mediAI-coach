This patient has jaw pain, a clicking noise when she chews, and associated headaches and
neck stiffness, which is suggestive of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) syndrome. The
underlying etiology of TMJ syndrome is multifactorial and includes TMJ derangement (eg, jaw
misalignment, trauma), and hypersensitivity of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). Mechanical
derangement of the TMJ can result in irritation and hypersensitivity of CN V3, leading to
pathologic contraction of the masseter and pterygoid muscles (which worsens jaw pain and
dysfunction). Spasms of these muscles can sometimes be palpated along the mandibular

ramus.

Repetitive jaw motions (eg, gum chewing, teeth grinding) are thought to contribute to the
development of TMJ syndrome due to increased workload and strain on the joint. Similar to
some other musculoskeletal pain disorders (eg, tension headache), TMJ pain also seems to
be related to psychiatric conditions and emotional distress.
