(Choice A) An association is a collection of malformations that are often seen together and do
not have a known, common cause (eg, VACTERL association).

(Choice B) Adisruption occurs when an external insult (rather than a genetic defect)
interrupts and arrests normal fetal development (eg, when an amniotic band disrupts limb
development). No specific external insult has been linked to Pierre Robin sequence, and most
cases result from genetic abnormalities.

(Choice C) Genomic imprinting is a normal process that refers to selective activation of gene
expression depending on the parent of origin. Aberrant imprinting occurs with uniparental
disomy (ie, when a person receives 2 copies of a chromosome from the same parent and no
copy from the other parent). Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome (15q) are
examples of conditions caused by dysfunctional imprinting.

(Choice E) Asyndrome is a collection of malformations that have a common cause but are
not related anatomically. For example, upslanting palpebral fissures, atrioventricular canal
defect, and single palmar crease are all due to trisomy 21.
