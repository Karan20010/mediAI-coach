(Choice A) Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus can have painless oral plaques or

ulcerations. Histopathology typically shows hyperkeratosis and degeneration of the basal

epithelial cells with perivascular inflammation, not dysplasia.

(Choice B) Lichen planus can present with lesions in the oral mucous membranes; pruritic,
purple/pink, polygonal papules and plaques often develop on the flexural surfaces of the wrists
and ankles. Histology usually shows a band of lymphocytic inflammation, degeneration of the
basal epithelium with apoptotic cells (ie, Civatte or colloid bodies), saw-toothed rete ridges,
hyperkeratosis, and hypergranulosis. Dysplasia would not be seen.

(Choice D) Oral hairy leukoplakia has a distinct, corrugated appearance and is caused by
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It occurs almost exclusively in patients with significant
immunosuppression (eg, HIV) and often resolves with antiretroviral treatment; it is not
premalignant. Pathology usually shows hyperparakeratosis and hyperplastic epithelium with
viral cytopathic effect (not dysplasia).

(Choice E) Leukoplakia that shows benign hyperkeratosis and epithelial hyperplasia or even
mild dysplasia may regress, especially if risk factors are modified (eg, cessation of tobacco
and alcohol use). When severe or full-thickness dysplasia is present (as in this case), it is

unlikely to spontaneously regress.
