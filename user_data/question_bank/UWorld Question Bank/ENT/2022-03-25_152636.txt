This patient with allergic rhinitis (eg, location-based sneezing and rhinorrhea; bluish,
congested nasal turbinates) likely became sensitized to farm allergens during her first visit.
Allergic rhinitis is a form of type 1 hypersensitivity, a process that involves sensitization and
elicitation phases.

Sensitization occurs when inhaled antigens penetrate the nasal epithelium and are presented
on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, causing activation of naive T-
helper (Th) cells. The release of cytokines (eg, IL-25, IL-33) from the nasal epithelium
causes Th cells to differentiate into Th2 cells that secrete IL-4, IL-13, and other lymphokines
that stimulate B cell maturation and production of IgE antibodies. Antigen-specific IgE
antibodies then bind to the high-affinity IgE receptor on mast cells, priming the patient for an
allergic response.

Repeat exposure to the inhaled antigens (eg, on subsequent visits to the farm) cross-links IgE
antibodies on the surface of the mast cell, leading to IgE receptor aggregation, which causes
mast cell degranulation (Choices A and C). This releases histamine and other vasoactive
mediators that lead to nasal inflammation, producing the allergic response. Subsequent
exposure to the same antigen can lead to further allergen priming, worsening symptoms over
time.
