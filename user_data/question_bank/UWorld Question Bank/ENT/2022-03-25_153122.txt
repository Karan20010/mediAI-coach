(Choice A) The nasal mucosa is likely inflamed and edematous in this patient, leading to
nasal congestion and rhinorrhea. However, edema of the nasal mucosa does not lead to
stridor or a barking cough.

(Choice B) The tonsils are located in the oropharynx and can become inflamed and
edematous in conditions such as mononucleosis or a peritonsillar abscess. Although severe
swelling in the oropharynx can lead to airway obstruction, it classically presents with voice
changes (ie, hot potato voice) but not a barking cough.

(Choice C) Inflammation and edema of the submandibular and sublingual spaces is
characteristic of Ludwig angina, a rapidly progressive cellulitis that can lead to airway
obstruction due to displacement of the tongue posteriorly. However, this typically occurs in
adults due to an infection in the mandibular molars and presents with a firm, elevated floor of
mouth, "woody" induration of the neck, drooling, and tripod positioning.

(Choice D) Epiglottitis is a severe infection that can lead to stridor and respiratory distress.
However, it does not cause a barking cough. In addition, it typically occurs in unimmunized
children and patients typically appear very ill, anxious, and have high fever, difficulty
