A 56-year-old previously healthy man comes to the office due to decreased hearing in both
ears. He reports difficulty understanding conversations in crowded rooms. His wife adds that
they often argue about the volume of the television set. The patient cannot remember
precisely when he first noticed hearing loss but says it has been present at least 6 months and
is getting worse. For the past 12 years, he has worked in a factory where he has to shout to
communicate with coworkers and has seldom worn hearing protection. An audiogram is
obtained as shown in the image below.
