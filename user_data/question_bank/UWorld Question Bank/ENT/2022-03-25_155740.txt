Educational objective:

Nontypeable strains of Haemophilus influenzae are part of the normal upper respiratory tract
flora and are a common cause of acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. Because
nontypeable strains do not form a polysaccharide capsule, immunity is not conferred by
vaccination with the H influenzae type b vaccine.
