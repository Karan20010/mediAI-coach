This patient has Méniére disease, a disorder of the inner ear characterized by increased
volume and pressure of endolymph (endolymphatic hydrops) that is thought to be due to
defective resorption of endolymph. The resultant distension of the endolymphatic system
causes damage to the vestibular and cochlear components of the inner ear. Méniére disease
is characterized by the following triad:

1. Low-frequency tinnitus, or ringing, in the affected ear, often accompanied by a feeling of
fullness

2. Vertigo, the subjective sensation of spinning or motion in the absence of actual motion;
commonly associated with lightheadedness, nausea, and vomiting

3. Sensorineural hearing loss, which is variable in severity but usually worsens over time
