The thick white patches seen on this patient's tongue are indicative of oral thrush
(oropharyngeal candidiasis). Thrush is a common variant of localized infection with Candida
fungi. Oral thrush is common in young infants due to immaturity of the newborn immune
system. In older children and adults, it is associated with immunosuppression and frequently
occurs in patients with HIV infection, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Asthma patients who take
oral or inhaled steroids are also at risk for candidiasis. Systemic antibiotic therapy and
dentures are other predisposing factors.

In immunocompetent patients, localized candidiasis is treated with topical antifungal
medications. Nystatin is a polyene antifungal with a mechanism of action similar to
amphotericin B. It binds to ergosterol molecules in the fungal cell membrane, causing pores
and leakage of fungal cell contents. Nystatin is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. It
is administered as an oral agent ("swish and swallow") for oropharyngeal candidiasis.
