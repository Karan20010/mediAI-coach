Educational objective:

Referred otalgia is common in head and neck pathology because many cranial nerves
innervate the ear (eg, CN V, VII, IX, X). In particular, tumors in the hypopharynx, larynx, or
base of tongue cause referred otalgia due to sensory contributions from the glossopharyngeal
and vagus nerves.
