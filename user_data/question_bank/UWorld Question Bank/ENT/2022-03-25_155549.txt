reduction in laryngeal sensation can impair the cough reflex.

(Choice B) The afferent limb of the gag reflex is mediated predominantly by the
glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX), whereas the efferent limb is carried by the vagus nerve (CN
X). Although the internal laryngeal nerve is a branch of CN X, it does not carry motor fibers
and is not involved in the gag reflex.

(Choice C) The muscles of mastication are innervated by the mandibular branch of the
trigeminal nerve (CN V;). This nerve is involved in the jaw jerk reflex, which is typically

prominent only in patients with upper motor neuron lesions.

(Choice D) Salivation is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve (which innervates the
parotid gland via the otic ganglion) and the facial nerve (which innervates submandibular and
sublingual glands via the submandibular ganglion). These nerves do not lie in close proximity
to the piriform recess.

(Choice E) Although the internal laryngeal nerve carries taste sensation from the root of the

tongue and epiglottis, its role in the perception of taste is extremely minor. Taste sensation is

primarily mediated by glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior one-third of the tongue and

oropharynx) and facial nerve (anterior two-thirds of the tongue). ctivate V
