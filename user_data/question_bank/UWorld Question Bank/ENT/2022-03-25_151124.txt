nerve supply of the temporomandibular joint and the areas of the brain involved in hearing.

(Choice A) The sensory component of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) carries general
sensory information from the tonsils, pharynx, middle ear, and posterior third of the tongue;
special sensory information (taste) from the posterior third of the tongue; and visceral sensory
information from the carotid bodies and carotid sinus.

(Choice B) The hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) carries general motor efferent information to the
intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue.

(Choice D) The auricular branch of the vagus nerve (CN X) conveys sensory information from
the external auditory canal but is not thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of TMD.
(Choice E) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) carries only special sensory information

(auditory and balance) from the inner ear.

Educational objective:
