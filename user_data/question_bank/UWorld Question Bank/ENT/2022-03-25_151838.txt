(Choice B) HIV infection causes chronic infections and weight loss. However, without a
known exposure (eg, blood transfusion), most pediatric HIV cases are transmitted perinatally;
these patients typically develop symptoms by age 2, unlike this patient, who is age 7. In
addition, nasal polyposis is rare with HIV.

(Choice C) Nasopharyngeal carcinoma presents with a nasopharyngeal mass that may cause
facial pain and associated weight loss. However, the tumor is typically unilateral, and the
diagnosis is usually in patients age >50.

(Choice D) Primary ciliary dyskinesia can present similarly to CF, with chronic rhinosinusitis
and nasal polyposis due to impaired mucociliary clearance. However, failure to thrive and
weight loss are not associated with this disorder.

(Choice E) Seasonal allergic rhinitis is a risk factor for developing sinus infections and nasal

polyposis but would not cause weight loss.

Educational objective:
Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis in children should prompt evaluation for cystic
fibrosis, especially when signs of pancreatic insufficiency (eg, loose stools, failure to thrive,

weight loss) are present. AGiVEKE Winelons
