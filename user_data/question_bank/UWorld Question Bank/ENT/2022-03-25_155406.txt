Vasoconstriction by a-adrenergic agonists is prominent in the vessels of the nasal mucosa,
making these medications effective decongestants. Phenylephrine, xylometazoline, and
oxymetazoline are used as topical preparations for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and
common cold associated congestion and rhinitis.

These medications, however, are characterized by rapidly declining effect after a few days of
use. This phenomenon is called tachyphylaxis. It occurs because of decreased production of
endogenous norepinephrine from the nerve terminals due to a negative feedback mechanism,
resulting in relative vasodilation (ie, removal of normal vasoconstrictive tone) and subsequent
edema and congestion. This leads to exacerbation of the nasal congestion symptoms.
Rebound rhinorrhea (ie, rhinitis medicamentosa) is described as nasal congestion without
cough, sneezing, or postnasal drip. Rhinorrhea may or may not be present (note the paradox
in naming). Rebound rhinorrhea is associated with the use of topical decongestants for > 3
days. The use of adrenergic agonists should be stopped to allow the restoration of normal
norepinephrine feedback pathways.
