(Choice A) The risk of certain epilepsy syndromes (eg, absence seizures, juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy) is increased with a positive family history. This patient's seizure was provoked by a
focal intraparenchymal lesion, which is inconsistent with epilepsy.

(Choice B) Shigella infection classically causes fever and bloody diarrhea and can be
associated with seizure and encephalopathy, particularly in children. However, brain
abscesses are not associated with this infection.

(Choice C) Congenital toxoplasmosis can cause long-term neurologic sequelae (eg, seizures,
hearing loss), but imaging typically reveals intracranial calcifications, which are not seen here.
In addition, although multiple ring-enhancing lesions are classic for CNS toxoplasmosis in
immunocompromised adults, these are not typically present in patients with congenital
infection. Moreover, this patient has a single lesion.

(Choice D) Immune thrombocytopenia can cause petechiae/bruising, recurrent minor
bleeding (eg, gingival bleeding), or severe hemorrhage (eg, gastrointestinal, intracranial).
Seizure may be a presenting sign of an acute intracranial bleed, but CT scan typically reveals
a hyperdense fluid collection, not a ring-enhancing lesion.
