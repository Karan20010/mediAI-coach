(Choice A) Arthropods can carry an infectious agent from one host and transmit it to another
(eg, Borrelia burgdorferi, West Nile virus); some infectious agents require maturation in the
arthropod vector prior to being infectious to humans (eg, plasmodium).

(Choice B) Respiratory droplets are created when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or
talks. These large respiratory droplets can contain viruses or bacteria (eg, diphtheria,
pertussis, influenza) that can infect others nearby (ie, <2 meters).

(Choices C and E) Indirect contact transmission includes diseases that are airborne (eg,
measles), and that spread through contaminated objects (eg, viral conjunctivitis), food (eg,
Clostridium botulinum), or contaminated drinking water (eg, cholera).

Educational objective:
Vertical direct transmission of human papillomavirus subtypes 6 and 11 can cause recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis, which results in wart-like growths most commonly on the true vocal

cords.
