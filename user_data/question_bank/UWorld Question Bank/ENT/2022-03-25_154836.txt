This patient with dysphagia, a base of tongue mass, and cervical lymphadenopathy likely has
mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC arises from the
mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract after accrual of multiple somatic mutations, often
caused by the mutagens found in tobacco. Other risk factors for HNSCC include age >40,
alcohol use, and immunocompromised status. There has also been a dramatic increase in
HNSCC due to human papillomavirus (HPV), which may be seen in younger, nonsmoking
patients.

Characteristic pathologic findings of HNSCC include nests and sheets of polygonal cells with
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm that invade the submucosa and surrounding structures;
intercellular bridges and keratin pearls (ie, foci of keratinization) may be seen on light
microscopy.
