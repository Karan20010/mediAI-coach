(Choice A) A paraganglioma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from extraadrenal,
autonomic paraganglia (eg, carotid body paraganglia) due to the abnormal migration of neural
crest cells. Carotid body paragangliomas typically present as lateral neck masses.

(Choice B) Cervical implantation of thymic tissue can result in ectopic thymic cysts, which are
rare lesions that may develop along the descent of the thymus (angle of the jaw to the
mediastinum). They are typically unilateral (left more often than right) rather than midline.

(Choice C) Acystic hygroma results from abnormal lymphatic development, leading to dilated
lymphatic vessels. It presents at birth as a soft mass at the posterior base or lateral aspect of
the neck. It would not typically be at the midline or rise with swallowing.

(Choice E) A branchial cleft cyst is an embryologic remnant of branchial arch structures that
presents as a lateral (rather than midline) neck mass. A sinus tract or fistula may also be
present.

(Choice F) Trapping of skin structures (eg, hair follicles, sebaceous glands) along embryonic
fusion lines results in the formation of a dermoid cyst within the subcutaneous tissue. It
presents as a midline neck mass but, in contrast to this patient's neck mass, does not move
with tongue protrusion or swallowing.
