This patient has high-frequency hearing loss due to chronic noise exposure. Transduction of
mechanical sound waves into nerve impulses occurs in the organ of Corti through the
following steps:

1. Sound reaches the middle ear by vibrating the tympanic membrane.

2. The vibration is transferred to the oval window by the ossicles.

3. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the basilar membrane, which in turn
causes bending of the hair cell cilia against the tectorial membrane.

4. Hair cell bending causes oscillating hyperpolarization and depolarization of the auditory
nerve, thereby creating nerve impulses from sound.

Noise-induced hearing loss results from trauma to the stereociliated hair cells of the organ
of Corti. The acoustic reflex normally dampens the effects of loud noise by causing the
stapedius and tensor tympani muscles to contract, which lessens the responsiveness of the
ossicles to sound. However, prolonged noise exposure can cause distortion or fracture of the
stereocilia due to shearing forces against the tectorial membrane. High-frequency hearing is
lost first, regardless of the frequency of the sound causing the damage.
