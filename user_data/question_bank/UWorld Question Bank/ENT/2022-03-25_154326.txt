A 15-year-old boy comes to the office due to right ear itching and discomfort for the past
several days. He has no fever or hearing loss but has noted scant drainage of thin, whitish
fluid. The patient has been taking swimming lessons at a local gym. On examination, there is
no redness around the ear, but gentle traction of the pinna elicits pain. During inspection of
the external auditory canal, a speculum is inserted into the meatus in close contact with its
posterior wall, causing the patient to suddenly become lightheaded and faint. He recovers
spontaneously within a few minutes with no residual confusion. Which of the following nerves
was most likely irritated during the procedure?

A. Accessory (0%)
B. Facial (10%)
C. Trigeminal (6%)
SY D. Vagus (50%)
E. Vestibulocochlear (32%)
