The nasal mucosa is highly vascular and easily irritated by trauma (eg, nose-picking), mucosal
dryness, foreign body insertion, and rhinitis (eg, allergy, infection). Epistaxis is very common
in children and may be classified as anterior or posterior, depending on the bleeding source.
Anterior nosebleeds are by far the most common, and the vast majority occur within the
vascular watershed area of the nasal septum (anteroinferior part of the nasal septal mucosa)
known as Kiesselbach plexus. Anastomosis of the following vessels occurs in this region:

¢ Septal branch of the anterior ethmoidal artery
¢ Lateral nasal branch of the sphenopalatine artery
¢ Septal branch of the superior labial artery (branch of the facial artery)

Management is directed at stopping the bleeding from Kiesselbach plexus, preferably by direct
compression of the nasal alae. Cautery (eg, silver nitrate) of the area surrounding the
bleeding site may be necessary for persistent bleeding.
