(Choice A) Acyclovir is an antiviral drug effective against herpes simplex virus (1 and 2) and
varicella zoster virus. It is a nucleoside analog that is converted into acyclo-GTP in infected
cells, which inhibits viral DNA polymerase.

(Choice B) Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal similar to nystatin used for systemic
mycoses. It is administered intravenously and never used for simple mucocutaneous
infections due to many toxic side effects.

(Choice C) Griseofulvin inhibits fungal cell mitosis at metaphase. It is indicated for the
treatment of dermatophytoses, not candidiasis.

(Choice E) Penicillins are B-lactam antibiotics that inhibit the formation of peptidoglycan
cross-links in bacterial cell walls.

(Choice F) Terbinafine is an allylamine antifungal that accumulates in the skin, nails, and
adipose tissue. It is used to treat dermatophytosis (onychomycoses), not candidiasis.
