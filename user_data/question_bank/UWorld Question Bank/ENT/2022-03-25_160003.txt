For an RNA molecule purified from a virus (ie, without viral capsid or envelope) to be
infectious (ie, able to induce viral protein synthesis and genome replication in the host cell) on
its own, it must act as MRNA capable of using the host's intracellular machinery for
translation. In other words, the purified RNA molecule must be single-stranded (SS) and
positive (+) sense, or SS(+). The question describes a naked (ie, nonenveloped) virus with
SS(+) RNA. Of the viruses listed, only rhinovirus (a picornavirus) has these features.
Generally, only RNA molecules purified from SS(+) viruses are infectious; purified SS negative
(â€”) sense RNA molecules and double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules are not as they require
additional enzymes.
