This patient with mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has developed a
second primary tumor, which is common with HNSCC due to field cancerization.

Field cancerization describes a large area of cells within a field (eg, upper aerodigestive tract)
that are "primed" to develop cancer because of widespread exposure to mutagens (eg,
tobacco). Mutations that affect many similar cells can increase the likelihood of developing
multiple primary malignancies, analogous to germline mutations in tumor suppressor genes
(eg, BRCA7 or BRCA2 in breast and ovarian cancer). Field cancerization likely underlies the
development of many common cancers, including:

¢ HNSCC due to mucosal exposure to tobacco carcinogens
¢ Basal cell carcinoma of the skin due to skin exposure to ultraviolet light
¢ Colorectal carcinoma due to epithelial exposure to dietary carcinogens

Even with adequate treatment of a malignancy, the areas affected by field cancerization
remain at higher risk of developing multiple primary malignancies, as seen in this patient.
Therefore, patients diagnosed with any of these cancers require comprehensive evaluation
and continued surveillance of the at-risk area (eg, colonoscopy, comprehensive skin
examination, panendoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract).
