Educational objective:

Cleft lip results when the maxillary prominence fails to fuse with the intermaxillary segment
during the fifth-sixth week of embryonic development. Cleft palate occurs when the palatine
shelves fail to fuse with one another or with the primary palate. Cleft lip and palate can occur

together or in isolation.
