Suppurative fluid accumulation increases middle ear pressure and causes the tympanic
membrane to become inflamed and bulge outward. If the eustachian tube remains obstructed,
this increased pressure can rupture the tympanic membrane.

(Choice A) Although Klebsiella pneumoniae can be a colonizer of the mouth and throat, it is
unlikely to cause AOM in otherwise healthy children. Instead, it more often causes respiratory
diseases in older, immunosuppressed patients (eg, pneumonia in patients with alcohol
overuse).

(Choice B) Moraxella catarrhalis is also an upper respiratory colonizer that can cause AOM.
However, infection with it is less common than with S pneumoniae.

(Choice C) Proteus mirabilis classically causes genitourinary infections; its ability to split urea
alkalinizes the urine, increasing the formation of kidney stones.

(Choice D) Pseudomonas aeruginosa is more commonly implicated in otitis externa than
AOM.

(Choice E) Staphylococcus aureus is typically found as a colonizer of the skin rather than the
respiratory tract. Therefore, it is more often implicated in skin and soft tissue infections,
including otitis externa.
