This patient has a cleft lip and palate, which can lead to problems with feeding, speech, and
orthognathic (ie, jaw) development. Children with cleft palate often have recurrent otitis
media due to eustachian tube dysfunction. The muscles primarily responsible for opening
the eustachian tube include the tensor veli palatini and the levator veli palatini.

The levator veli palatini arises from the petrous portion of the temporal bone and medial part
of the eustachian tube. Its fibers insert into the superior portion of the palatine aponeurosis
(soft palate) and interdigitate in the midline with the contralateral muscle fibers. It elevates the
soft palate during swallowing to prevent food from refluxing into the nasopharynx; contraction
also opens the eustachian tube. With cleft palate, levator veli palatini insertion is no longer
stable, so contraction does not lead to force on the eustachian tube.
