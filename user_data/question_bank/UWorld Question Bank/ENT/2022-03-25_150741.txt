This patient has a thy
characteristically mov
often detected when i

roglossal duct cyst (TDC), which presents as a midline mass that
es superiorly with protrusion of the tongue or swallowing. A TDC is
becomes secondarily infected after an upper respiratory tract infection,

leading to erythema and tenderness. It may also be noted incidentally during evaluation of

throat or neck symptoms.

The thyroid gland is
the tongue. It then de

ormed as an outpouching from the pharyngeal epithelium at the base of
scends to the base of the anterior neck via the thyroglossal duct, which

extends from the foramen cecum on the dorsal surface of the tongue to the superior border of

the thyroid isthmus. |

the duct fails to atrophy normally, a TDC can develop from the epithelial

remnants within the duct. Because the tract connects to the base of the tongue, protrusion or

swallowing causes the TDC to move superiorly. Ectopic thyroid tissue may also form and can

reside anywhere along the thyroglossal duct's path.
