This patient's presentation is consistent with malignant otitis externa (MOE), a severe infection
most commonly seen in elderly diabetic patients. It is most frequently caused by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a nonlactose-fermenting, oxidase-positive, motile Gram-negative
rod. Patients typically present with exquisite ear pain and drainage. The granulation tissue
seen within the ear canal is an important characteristic finding of MOE, and the tympanic
membrane is usually intact. Progression of this infection can lead to osteomyelitis of the skull
base and cranial nerve damage. Treatment consists of systemic antibiotics such as
ciprofloxacin that are effective against P aeruginosa.
