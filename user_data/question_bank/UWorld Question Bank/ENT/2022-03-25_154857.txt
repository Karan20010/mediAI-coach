(Choice A) Squamous papillomas are benign tumors that have fibrovascular cores
surrounded by squamous epithelium. They can occur in the mucosa of the upper
aerodigestive tract but would not spread to regional lymph nodes as they are not malignant.

(Choice B) Adenocarcinomas arise due to mutation of glandular cells and often retain
glandular features and some glandular functions, including the production of mucin. The
mucosa of the head and neck is made of stratified squamous cells; therefore, cancers arising
from this region often retain some features of squamous cells (eg, production of keratin).

(Choice C) Oral candidiasis (ie, thrush) often has an inflammatory infiltrate with
pseudohyphae and can present with oral lesions. However, oral candidiasis characteristically
appears as white plaques on an erythematous base throughout the mucosa. It does not form
a palpable mass or cause firm cervical adenopathy.

(Choice E) Although non-Hodgkin lymphoma, such as follicular lymphoma (characterized by
nodular proliferation of lymphocytic follicles), can rarely present in a tonsil, it is unlikely to occur
in the base of tongue and is overall much less common than HNSCC, especially in a patient
age >60 with a long history of tobacco use.
