(Choice G) The superior laryngeal nerve branches off the vagus nerve high in the neck and
divides into an external branch, which supplies the cricothyroid muscle, and an internal branch,
which provides sensation over the supraglottic area. The external branch of this nerve may be
misligated during thyroid surgery due to its proximity to the superior thyroid artery.
