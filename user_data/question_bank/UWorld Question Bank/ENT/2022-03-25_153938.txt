(Choices A and B) The lateral nasa! wall contains the superior, middle, and inferior turbinates
(also Known as conchae). These 3 bony projections are covered with mucous membrane;
they warm, humidify, and filter inspired air and expand and contract in response to
environmental changes (eg, temperature, humidity, allergens). The turbinates form
corresponding meatuses that serve as drainage pathways. The superior meatus provides
drainage for the sphenoidal and posterior ethmoidal sinuses. The middle meatus drains the
frontal, maxillary, and anterior ethmoidal sinuses and is the most common site of nasal polyps.
The inferior meatus drains the nasolacrimal duct.

(Choices D and E) Branches of the sphenopalatine artery supply the posterolateral wall and
posterior choanae. These posterolateral branches are the most likely source of posterior
nosebleeds. Posterior epistaxis is usually severe and cannot be treated with cautery.

Educational objective:

Epistaxis is commonly caused by irritation of the highly vascular mucosa at the anterior nasal
septum. The anterior nasal septum contains the Kiesselbach plexus. The anterior ethmoidal,
sphenopalatine, and superior labial arteries anastomose in this region.
