parasympathetic outflow via the vagus nerve leads to decreased heart rate and blood
pressure.

(Choice A) The accessory nerve (CN XI) provides voluntary motor innervation to the trapezius
and the sternocleidomastoid.

(Choice B) The facial nerve (CN VII) has a small motor component to the stapedius and
muscles behind the ear. It supplies cutaneous sensation to a small area of the auricle, but
stimulation here would be unlikely to trigger a vasovagal response.

(Choice C) The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve carries sensation from the majority
of the external auditory meatus, except for the posterior wall.

(Choice E) The vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) mediates hearing and vestibular
proprioception. It does not mediate any cutaneous sensation.

Educational objective:

The vagus nerve provides cutaneous sensation to the posterior external auditory canal via its
small auricular branch. Sensation to the rest of the canal is from the mandibular division of the
trigeminal nerve.
