Educational objective:

In conductive hearing loss, bone conduction will be greater than air conduction (abnormal
Rinne test), and the Weber test will lateralize to the affected ear. In sensorineural hearing
loss, air conduction will be greater than bone conduction (normal Rinne test), and the Weber

test will lateralize to the unaffected ear.
