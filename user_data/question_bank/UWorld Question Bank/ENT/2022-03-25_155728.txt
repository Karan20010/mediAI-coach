This patient with fever and an inflamed, perforated tympanic membrane with purulent otorrhea
has acute otitis media. Middle ear infections occur most commonly in young children (age 6
months to 2 years) and are typically due to Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus
influenzae.

H influenzae is a small, oxidase-positive, gram-negative coccobacillus typically classified by
the antigens in its polysaccharide capsule. However, there are multiple strains of H
influenzae that do not produce a capsule; these nontypeable strains are part of the normal
upper respiratory tract flora but can also cause acute otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis.

Vaccination against H influenzae is with the protein-conjugated Hib vaccine, which confers
immunity only to the more invasive type b strain (Choice A). The vaccine is recommended in
all children to prevent Hib-associated bacteremia, pneumonia, epiglottitis, and meningitis. In
countries with widespread Hib vaccination (eg, United States), most H influenzae strains
isolated from children with respiratory mucosal infections (including acute otitis media) are
nontypeable.
