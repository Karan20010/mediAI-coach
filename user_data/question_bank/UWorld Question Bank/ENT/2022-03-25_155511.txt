The piriform recesses are small cavities that lie on either side of the laryngeal orifice. They
are bounded medially by the aryepiglottic folds and laterally by the thyroid cartilage and
thyrohyoid membrane. During normal swallowing, food is diverted by the epiglottis laterally
through the piriform recesses into the esophagus without endangering the airway.

A thin layer of mucosa overlying the piriform recess is all that protects the superficially coursing
internal laryngeal nerve, a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve (part of the vagus nerve
[CN X]). Unlike the recurrent and external laryngeal nerves that carry motor fibers to the
muscles involved in vocal cord function, the internal laryngeal nerve contains only sensory and
autonomic fibers. It mediates the afferent limb of the cough reflex by carrying sensation from
the mucosa superior to the vocal cords.

Damage to the internal laryngeal nerve can occur when foreign bodies (eg, chicken or fish
bones) become lodged in the piriform recess or during attempts to retrieve them. The resulting
reduction in laryngeal sensation can impair the cough reflex.
