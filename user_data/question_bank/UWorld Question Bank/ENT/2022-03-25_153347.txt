(Choice A) An allergic reaction to soy products can cause nasal and ocular symptoms.
However, it also typically includes a rash, swelling or itching of the mouth and lips, and/or
gastrointestinal symptoms. In addition, it most commonly presents in early childhood when
soy is introduced into the diet.

(Choice C) Rhinitis symptoms caused by exposure to cold air are classically associated with
nonallergic or vasomotor rhinitis. Nonallergic rhinitis typically does not cause conjunctivitis
symptoms.

(Choice D) Tobacco smoke is a respiratory irritant that can worsen symptoms of allergic
rhinitis; however, tobacco allergy is rare, and depending on route of intake, would likely
produce significant oral (eg, mouth itching/swelling) and pulmonary (eg, asthma) symptoms.

(Choice E) Like allergic rhinitis, medication allergies can be type 1 hypersensitivity reactions.
However, these allergies typically present with an urticarial rash shortly after ingestion of the
medication; eye symptoms are uncommon.

Educational objective:

Allergic rhinitis often causes nasal congestion, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and conjunctivitis due to
an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response. Patients can often distinguish patterns that

suggest reactions to specific allergens.
