This patient's presentation is most consistent with temporomandibular joint disorder

(TMD). The underlying etiology of TMD is multifactorial and includes temporomandibular joint
derangement (eg, jaw misalignment, jaw clenching/teeth grinding, trauma) and hypersensitivity
of the mandibular nerve (CN V3). In addition to the classic symptoms of dull, waxing-and-
waning face/jaw pain (worse with chewing) and clicking/popping noises with jaw movement,
TMD can also present with ear-related symptoms (eg, ear pain, ear stuffiness, tinnitus).

Many of these clinical findings are due to involvement of the mandibular nerve (CN V3),
which is the largest branch of the trigeminal nerve. It supplies sensation to the
temporomandibular joint, floor of mouth, anterior tongue, and lower part of the face. In
addition, it contributes to the sensory innervation of the external auditory canal; therefore,
TMD can present with ear pain that is referred from the jaw joint. Ear stuffiness may be
related to hypersensitivity affecting the tensor tympani. Theories regarding tinnitus in TMD
include the proximity of the muscles of mastication to the ear and central connections between
nerve supply of the temporomandibular joint and the areas of the brain involved in hearing.
