(Choices A, D, and F) HNSCC can originate from the mucosa of other anatomic sites. Many
sites (eg, base of tongue, piriform sinus) initially cause only vague or minor symptoms, but
some may present with more specific features (eg, hoarseness in vocal cord cancer). Cancer
at any of these other sites (ie, base of tongue, piriform sinus, vocal cord) would not lead to
obstruction of the eustachian tube with a resultant middle ear effusion.

(Choice C) Cancer of the parotid gland may spread to the cervical lymph nodes. The
superior portion of the parotid gland is near the external auditory canal of the ear, not the
eustachian tube. In addition, because the parotid gland is near the skin surface, primary
tumors of the parotid are typically palpable.

(Choice E) Cancer of the thyroid gland may spread to the cervical lymph nodes. However, it
is very rare to have squamous cell carcinoma in the thyroid, and enlargement of the thyroid
gland would not block the eustachian tube.

Educational objective:
The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nasopharynx. Cancer located in the
nasopharynx can lead to obstruction of the eustachian tube, causing a middle ear effusion.
