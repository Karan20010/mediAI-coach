This child has vocal fold lesions that histologically demonstrate a fibrovascular core with
benign squamous cells, which is consistent with laryngeal papillomas due to recurrent
respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). These lesions are often warty or grape-like and, as with
skin papillomas, have dark-red punctate areas corresponding to blood vessels.

Laryngeal papillomas are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) subtypes 6 and 11, which
are also the subtypes most likely to cause genital warts (ie, condyloma acuminatum). A
mother with genital warts is the most important risk factor for developing RRP. An infection
acquired from a patient's mother during pregnancy, delivery, or the first 4 weeks postpartum is
called vertical transmission. HPV infection is often acquired via direct contact during
passage through the birth canal. The incidence of RRP is decreasing significantly, which is
likely due to increasing HPV vaccination (which typically includes serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18)
in future mothers.
